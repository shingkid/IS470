In this research, we focus on the social phenomenon of suicide.
Specifically, we perform social sensing on digital traces obtained from
Reddit. We analyze the posts and comments in that are related to
suicide. We perform natural language processing to better understand
different aspects of human life that relate to suicide.

This repository accompanies the poster paper which was accepted for the
IEEE Big Data Conference 2018 and will be presented in Seattle, WA, this
