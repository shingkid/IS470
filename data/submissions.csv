Update from the Depressed Asshole,59,8vgrob,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8vgrob/update_from_the_depressed_asshole/,30,2018-07-02 23:26:04,"About 3-4 months ago, I posted on reddit about my situation and depressed I am about the future. Link - [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/868w56/depressed\_about\_future\_prospects/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/868w56/depressed_about_future_prospects/)

Well, I finally left the house today to for the first time in months (Thanks Amazon Groceries!) to seek help and I thought I would post an update here since some of you cared - I think. The doctor didn't think I have hit the threshold to be considered depressed, but I need help with emotional control and some therapy could be good for me. I am open to that option, but its going to take awhile for an appointment slot so let's see. No money, can't complain when waiting for a subsidy slot. Nonetheless, I am prescribed with Fluoxetine for a month to help my mood.

To be honest, I am still very adverse to getting help because of social workers and the horrible experience from some ppl in my last post. That might or might not have been my fault, but when I took certain advice and was told by ""official channel"" to come back only when I have run out of money, it feels very soul crushing. I feel like going to the casino and gamble my savings away. Who knows, I might become a millionaire overnight. Nonetheless, I have made a personal note to ignore all social workers henceforth. They only know how to talk, and fulfill their self gratification to do one good deed per day. There were some nice people though, but they disappeared down the road... don't ask me why. I don't know why. But it just goes to cement my opinion that ""help"" is talk only.

Truth be told, I actually tried to kill myself in May after receiving more headache news. I was so disappointed in having to do anymore and everything myself. I stayed awake the entire night, waiting to slit my wrist the next morning in bed after overdosing on aspirin for blood thinning. I had a plan to ensure that I was dead when anyone found me. The sudden bout of despair was so real, I spent hours crying alone in the toilet. But the plan didn't execute, only because I couldn't order aspirin on amazon and I couldn't get another replacement for blood thinner. I have no interest in ""attempting"" then calling the ambulance myself. I want to die, I don't want help because all help as so superficial. The reality that even trying to kill myself is a burden eventually set in, and I decided to sought medical help. I suppose if I am going to die, I might as well figure out what I am suffering from and explore the options before dying. At least, I can tell God that... well, it didn't help.

Anyway, this is just an update. I don't really have anything to add. There hasn't been any real positive update and I have buried myself in games as a distraction and escape. At least in game, effort = opportunities. Unlike real life, no paper degree? No opportunities. Well to be fair, I did had one opportunity at my last job, but I burned the bridge when I resigned in a rage. Well, not going to matter if I am going to die anyway. That's it from me, maybe I will update again or maybe I won't. I don't really know what's the point, and I assume the reader would feel the same as well. All the best to everyone and thanks for being supportive previously. Sorry I can't help myself, I don't know what I don't know. I still have money for living expenses for a year more, so don't worry. The budget is just very strict, so I feel a little sad when groceries shopping. Feels like the kid who wants a cotton candy at the park but was told ""NO! NO YOU DON""T!"". Where is the money from? *Ah, that's the money I saved for my degree.* You know, the one I dropped halfway because my Dad got a stroke. So ya, advising me to get a job, save some money and do my degree is very good advise. I totally appreciate it, feels so true! I am so looking forward to scrapping money again for a degree!

Don't know how to deal with offensive comments without affecting my work relationships,18,2rmxjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2rmxjc/dont_know_how_to_deal_with_offensive_comments/,23,2015-01-08 07:48:56,"Throwaway! I just want to know there are people who have been in the same situation so I don't feel so completely alone with my convictions. I've recently graduated and am now in the corporate workforce - and I get it. I really, reaaaally do. There's a certain set of rules and norms when working in a Singaporean corporate environment, and I can't expect the same freedom to speak my mind I was afforded in university ..and which was sort of encouraged in the particular course I took. 

But I like to think there are some issues I can't not stand for... because if I didn't fight for them, I'd just become an empty, spineless ghost of a person and then I might as well quit before that happens. It first started quite innocuously at a casual meeting with a big group of people from my department and a few others we worked closely with. Long story short, the group made a round of derogatory remarks/jokes about homosexuals and homosexuality in general, and I didn't feel comfortable about that at all. I strongly believe sexuality does not *need* to be gendered and when I was in college I've always had the prerogative to debate and speak my mind quite aggressively on the issue whenever it came up. But at that moment I laughed. I laughed because everyone else was laughing and I didn't want to be *that guy* in my new work circle. I was also wary about fitting in, being a wet blanket and causing unnecessary conflict..especially when my boss didn't seem to mind it.

It felt like intense betrayal because I had close friends and family who'd struggled with the social stigma of being different and I knew how innocent jokes could end up hurting people in a very real way. And yet I wasn't doing anything, in fact my silence had contributed in my acceptance of what they had said. For days after I couldn't stop thinking about what I should have said, or worked out scenarios where I could keep silent but walk away in quiet protest. It would have been a luxury to do so when in reality I wasn't ready to lose my new job by doing something overt. I thought about approaching HR but I knew enough about their priorities to know that they'll just insinuate that I shouldn't cause any trouble. 

It's a conundrum because I do have work-friends (that I enjoy otherwise), but at the same time these are friends I can't escape or come to blows with if I find their views objectionable because we have to work together. I hate myself each time I end up keeping quiet or nodding my head to something I don't agree with and it's gotten to a point where I've become slightly depressed because I can't be the same person I was in college, who stood up for what I thought was right. I can't decide what I should do since the many Singaporeans are pretty close-minded and I suspect homophobia is highly explicit anywhere or at least accepted all around, so there's no point thinking of getting out. Campaigning for awareness within my company will definitely not be sanctioned or approved either since we wouldn't want any public backlash.

PAP MP Inderjit Singh shares his objections to the recently released White Paper on Population,28,17zs3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17zs3x/pap_mp_inderjit_singh_shares_his_objections_to/,27,2013-02-07 03:01:52,"Speech by Mr Inderjit Singh,
MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC

On the White Paper on Population

Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the White Paper on Population.

While the report has some compelling arguments for the 6.9m population figure projected, we all know it is based mainly on economic considerations. Had we focused on things like building a cohesive nation with a strong national identity, the outcome would likely be very different.

I feel the time has come for us to find a better balance between economic growth and social cohesion and yes there will have to be tradeoffs of economic growth but I would rather trade some of these for a cohesive, united nation where people feel taken care of at home and are confident of their future. I am not saying we go for low or no growth. Instead I am willing to adjust my growth expectations for a more comfortable life for all Singaporeans. I am confident we will still be able to pursue respectable economic growth when companies and Singaporeans are faced with a situation of tightened labour availability by focusing on improving ourselves through productivity and higher value capabilities. Finland and other small nations have done, we can do it too.

Our past decade of rapid population growth has already created too many problems which need to be solved first before we take the next step. I call on the government to take a breather for five years, solve all the problems created by the past policies of rapid economic and population growth. We can safely say that we have failed to achieve the goal set by the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, of a Swiss standard of living for most Singaporeans, except for the higher income Singaporeans including foreigners who just recently decided to make Singapore their home. So I call for a breather in this quest of growing the population and focus on improving the lives of Singaporeans and achieve that promised Swiss Standard of living for most Singaporeans first before we plan our next growth trajectory.

Taking Care of the Singaporean Core
I have a big issue with the number of PRs and new citizens we are planning to add to our population. I don't see the necessity to be as aggressive when the key consideration of the population growth is the economy. We have already added too many new citizens and PRs and need time for integration and social cohesion to happen. Looking at history, our population grew from around 2.4m in 1980 to 3m in 1990 and then to 4m in 2000, reaching 5.3m last year. Just looking at the resident population alone, we grew the numbers from 2.3m in 1980 to 2.7m in 1990, 3.3m in the year 2000 and then to 3.8m last year. So in the last decade we added more than 1m to the resident population, and the in last 25 years, which is close to 1 generation of Singaporeans, we have added another close to 50% more to our resident population. I believe this must be the fastest rate of population growth in the world and I feel this is just too much for us to comfortably go back and build a national identity and social cohesion which was progressing very well till the 1990s. Adding another 500,000 to 800,000 more PRs and citizens as proposed by the white paper will be disastrous and add to our already difficult infrastructure and social problems.

If it is economic growth we want then let's just adopt the Dubai model of a transient workforce which will give us a lot more flexibility to manage numbers in the longer term. On PRs, today we already have too many of them and they are enjoying full citizen privileges without the citizens' responsibilities. For example;
- Far too many PR boys who skip NS when they turn 18. After enjoying the privileges they have a choice of not doing NS and then leave the country. I believe only around 30% of all PR boys do NS today. Well, our Singapore sons don't have a choice but to do NS, it is an office not to do it.
- PR children study at their International system schools sticking to their home cultures.
- PRs can buy HDB flats from the open market driving prices of HDB flats too high.

So I urge the government to reduce the number of projected new PRs and citizens just to the population replacement levels and be more selective and differentiate their privileges from citizens. I have a few suggestions for the government to consider;

• The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round, reduce fees for Singaporeans not just increase for PRs.

• PR children must be made do national service - it should no longer be a choice and we should make it an offence if they don’t do it. We should not grant PRs to families who don’t commit their sons to National Service.

• HDB - if a PR buys a HDB flat from the open market, charge a levy of say $50k and allow them to sell only to Singaporeans. If the PR takes up citizenship within 5 years, we can refund the levy.

• Children of PRs should be made to study in our national schools so that we increase the chance of integrating them at the next generation.

• On the employment front, it is time we implement a Singaporean first hiring policy like what is done in some developed countries like Canada. Companies should show proof first that they were not able to fill a position with a Singaporean before they are allowed to hire a foreigner.

• Reconsider the dependents policy - I have come across a number of cases where our targeted one child from China brings in 2 parents who then bring 2 parents each as their dependents - Net is that we gain one young one child who we brought in for our future but also inherited 6 older people - making our ageing population issue worse not better.

I feel the differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens.

This brings me to the point of how many Singaporeans are feeling about the presence of such huge numbers of new citizens, PRs and foreigners amongst our midst. First for housing - there is no doubt that the influx of foreigners in Singapore has driven up our property prices. PRs are buying HDB flats from the open market which drives up prices.

Just last week I had a dialogue session with my private estates residents and one of my residents complained that a new citizens recently bought a landed property in this old estate and was building a 3 and a half storey towering house. Well the, new citizen, the owner of the house was also present and when, I spoke with him during the tea session I found out that he was a new citizen formerly from China, just gained his citizenship and bought not 1 but 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru alone. I was surprised and saddened because many Singaporeans cannot afford to do the same, and this new citizen, no matter how he may have made his wealth is able to do so.

Many young Singaporeans I talk to, especially those who have recently graduated and have just entered the workforce feel demoralized because many of the things that they grew up aspiring to have are now beyond their reach. Our aggressive growth strategies, which allowed cheaper foreign workers, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans. I remember when I started work in 1985, my salary was $1900 as an entry level engineer. After a few years I could afford a house and a car. Today, 28 years later, an entry level engineer in Singapore earns $2600, just $700 more than what I earned when I started. The mathematics is very simple, the cost of living did not just go up by 1.3% per annum the last 27 years and even more, the cost of owning a HDB flat is did not just go up by 37% since 1985.

Finally, I am perturbed by the banquet analogy used by Minister Khaw. We are talking about lives of Singaporeans. Our banquet guests come for one night and leave when the function is over. There is no turning back when we grant PR and citizenships. We must be more exact about the numbers we want to add to the Singapore population and not plan on a basis of 'hoping we hit some number"". Because if overdo things and end up with a population of more than 7m, it may be too late to stop the fast moving train of population growth when we fire up all the engines of growing the population. We missed the mark the last 10 years, and are already paying a high price for that mistake.

In my speech in this house in 2008 during the committee of supply debate on the population I urged the government to abandon the ""the instant tree mentality"" in trying to grow the population in response to the declining birth rates. At that time, I did not agree with the rate of growth pursued and we know the consequences and the hardship Singaporeans faced as a result of the rapid growth, Instant trees cannot grow strong roots and can be uprooted in difficult times. I once again urge the government to slow down and plan on reaching their population target over a longer time horizon. I don't think we can live with a 6.9m population in 2030. We may be able to handle it in 2050, no one really knows. Please abandon this 'instant tree"" mentality as we cannot afford to make Singaporeans lives more difficult as a result. I rather we err on the side of caution when it comes to growing our population. We cannot keep paying a high price for planning misjudgements.

In Conclusion, I would like to see us take a breather from re-growing our population again. We have too many problems as a result of the last breath taking population growth rate. As a government we need to rebuild the trust and confidence among Singaporeans that our citizens matter most to us and that we are willing take a break from our relentless drive for growth to solve their problems, make their lives more comfortable, give them a better quality of life and show them that any future growth of population will not create similar social and cost of living problems. At this stage many Singaporeans from all walks of life don't have the confidence that we can handle another steep growth of the population, so let's not push it. I would like all of us, including the government to spend the time creating and environment that gives us confidence in our future and one where our young can see a sense of hope of opportunity and if we fail to instil a sense of hope and opportunity for our future generations, we will not be able to root them here and build a strong national identity and a strong nation. This is what building a strong Singapore core should entail. So let's delay all plans for further population growth for n",mburg777,feel alone depressed

I honestly think at first he was trying to get me on his side cause our friends and he had had a falling out, and idk if he was trying to guilt trip me or what, but when I didn't respond the way he probably wanted me to, he went offline and didn't pick up my calls.

I think he blames me...and truth be told, I feel a little guilty for subjecting him to that, but I'm not even out of my teens myself, and it was the only thing I could think of to save him. I didn't want that guilt on me, should he die, that I didn't do what I should have to keep him alive. 

He's still under the impression that nothing is his fault, and that he's being mistreated etc etc, so idek. I guess I just wanted to get it out.

Why 377A matters to me. I posted this on Facebook and my friend prompted me to share it here.,1455,9i530c,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9i530c/why_377a_matters_to_me_i_posted_this_on_facebook/,549,2018-09-23 18:12:04,"""Homosexuals are doomed to spend eternity in hell. If they wanted to change, they could be healed of their evil ways. If they would turn away from temptation, they could be normal again. If only they would try, and try harder, if it doesn't work.""

These were the words said by Mary Griffith to her son, Bobby Griffith, in the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" - a story of a how Mary Griffith, staunch Christian Mom of Bobby Griffith, fights to cure her gay son of his homosexuality. Bobby eventually spirals into depression and self-loathing. One night, he falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming truck, which kills him instantly.

I still remember that afternoon, almost ten years ago by now. My mom and I were in the car on Grange Road, just about to turn left into Ngee Ann City. This was during the aftermath of the AWARE saga in Singapore (AWARE is a women's organization in Singapore. in 2009, a group of right-wing Christians orchestrated a takeover protest of their sexual education material in which same-sex attraction was deemed OK). The radio was covering the story and asked for listeners to call in with their views on the matter. After listening to the cover, my mom at the steering wheel turned to me and said a sentence I will never forget.

""These homosexuals are evil, and they should burn in hell.""

I understand that in staunchly religious households, such words would not have been uncommon. However, what affected me was the speed, the surprise, and the suddenness of it all. I was minding my own business in the car, and in that single sentence, the mom that I knew for twenty years was gone. In her stead I could only see someone else - caring in same way, but it never felt like the same person that I could trust. If this person found out about my secret, what would happen to me? I dared not find out.

To my mom, it was an off-handed comment that she probably won't remember. But to me, it felt like my entire world was upended.

Have you watched the Pixar movie, Inside Out? Central to the movie was the idea of core memories, which were key moments in one's life that shape one's personality. This very moment, to me, became one of them. The suddenness of the topic and the vitriol in her voice was unforgettable. This memory has stuck to me till this very day, almost ten years down the road.

If you're gay, no one is safe, not even from their families. The world felt a lot darker, and a lot more dangerous.

I stayed silent for the rest of the journey. At the time, it was only a few more months until it was time for me to go to America to pursue my undergraduate studies. It was in that very moment, I vowed to myself that I *must* keep my secret away from family. I knew that had my parents found out, there was a real danger that they would cut off funding to me and call me back because they would assume I was 'influenced by the western agenda' - even though I already knew starting in secondary school!

For the next four years, I bided my time in college. I did call back to my parents, but I hated the idea of doing so. I figured that the less I share about my life, the less likely my parents would find out, and I could graduate in peace. The goal was to remain closeted until I was financially independent, and I succeeded. I am fortunate to come from a financially stable family. My parents have absolutely no need for me to support them for retirement. Hence, my primary concern was to establish a stable income for myself. It was only through freedom of a stable income could I not rely on the parents that could possibly kick me out for being gay. Was that paranoia? True, it was highly unlikely for my family. But it was a chance I could not afford to take.

Overall, I had a good college experience. Back in Singapore, my church, while not outwardly hateful, did weigh in on the topic of homosexuality with the usual quotes from Leviticus, along with a sprinkle of ""lifestyle"", ""choice"", and (my personal favorite) ""hate the sin, not the sinner."" At least I could now enjoy my Sundays, without the occasional self-denigration from the pulpit.

But the past sermons and that memory continued to affect me. Night after night, I called out to God and asked him why? Why couldn't I, like the Book of Mormon musical, ""turn it off""? It certainly didn't feel like a choice. If it was, why burden me with such a choice when everyone else seems to have it easy? Is this God’s cruel punishment on me for something else? I always wondered what would have happened if I was born gay in a different environment. I read of Matthew Shepherd, the American student who was beaten, tortured, and left to die. I read of news about ISIS, where brothers and parents threw their gay families off buildings. Some friends dismissed it as the work of crazy people. All I could think of was that car drive on Grange Road. I could not shake off the look in her eyes. Perhaps society is just a few laws away from craziness, after all.

Four years passed and I got my degree with distinction. I returned back to Singapore, with a stable job waiting for me - mission accomplished! But shortly after, my dad decided to have a private talk with me - one of the few he's ever had with me his entire life. He inquired why I felt so distant, so different from the boy he once knew. My mom, who was always a worrywart, has visibly aged since four years ago. Because I have become so distant and resistant to communication, she worried even more in my absence.

I was not ready to share the real reason why I was so silent. I clammed up again. I felt no motivation to share my reason anymore. I have survived four years without sharing my life. Why start now? I have learned to stop caring about sharing my life with my parents.

Shortly, my mom found out about my sexuality. I gathered it was probably due to my over-zealous sharing of Pink Dot posts on Facebook (I didn’t really care about them finding out at this point). One day, my Mom confronted me about it. When she took my silence to be a ‘yes’, while holding back tears, the first words out of her mouth were ""We shouldn't have sent you to the U.S."" In the end, my prior fears were not unfounded. In that moment, I felt validated - validated that my strategy for those four years was not unfounded and could have saved me from an early withdrawal from school.

Thankfully, for me, it was a (reasonably) happy end. After the tears, she said that while she can't approve of my 'lifestyle' due to the church, she did say that she still loves me.

Overall, I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Besides this incident, my parents have given me every material need, the necessary attention, and tools needed to succeed in life. I was never thrown out of the house, beaten as child, nor been assaulted on the street (yet). However, I cannot say the same for some of my friends and the greater gay community as a whole. I have no illusions; I've had a great life so far. But if that single moment on Grange Road still affects me ten years after, I am sure that some other son, in some other less privileged family, with less money, less love, and denied opportunities to stay hidden, would have it much worse. ""Prayers for Bobby"" was based off a true story, after all.

Hence, for those who believe that 377A is 'just a symbol', then consider yourself even more fortunate than I am. To many, 377A is not 'just a symbol'. For some, 377A has become the flag in which the religious right is using to rally its supporters. For some, 377A is a constant reminder that we feel less like citizens but more like a bargaining chip to the government. For some, 377A has become the perfect veil for others say hurtful, ignorant comments with little repercussions on sunny little Singapore.

To me, it is clear: day after day, 377A is a sum of all of the above. It is a constant reminder that we are alone against our bullies.

To the religious who believe that repealing 377A will lead to the moral decay of Singapore, the story of ""Prayers for Bobby"" does not end at Bobby's death. Marry Griffith desperately searches for answers to her son's death and eventually realizes that it was her hurtful words that drove her own son to suicide. She shares in her closing speech:

""Unknown to you, they will be listening, as you echo 'amen'. And that will soon silence their prayers. Their prayers to God for understanding, and acceptance, and for your love. But your hatred, and fear, and ignorance of the word 'gay' will silence their prayers. So, before you echo 'amen' in your home, and place of worship, think. Think, and remember. A child is listening.""

So if you've read all the way to this point, please remember that even if you are a regular churchgoer with no contact with the gay community, I am sure that someone you know and love is being hurt by your very actions. It could be one of the quiet kids sitting in the corner every Sunday School. It could be your best friend, your cousin who's never seemed to have a girlfriend. Above all, it could be your son who you never suspected a bit. And just like every mention of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 from the pulpit, I can tell you from personal experience that each mention of 377A along with the ""hate the sin, not the sinner"" rhetoric will chip away at that kids self-esteem and self-worth.

So let the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" be a cautionary tale. The real damage to society will not come from the moral decay that you speak of. It will come from the erosion of trust between you and the children that you never knew were listening to your words all along. As Mary Griffith realized too late, you can't turn back the clock once the deed has been done.

But unlike Mary Griffith's situation, the Singapore story does not end... yet. The absence of 377A itself will also be a new symbol. A symbol that a secular Singapore with religions preaching harmony and not division as the way forward. A symbol that the government does not make short-term voter gains at the expense of minority citizens. A symbol that gay people are no longer defined by a law 'gross indecency' but are finally reduced to mere human beings, just like everyone else.

And for those who aren't LGBT and are quiet or ambivalent about showing your support, we do need your help to drown out the noise of bigotry. Just as how my experience was traumatic and drove me back to hiding, your outward show of support, whether you realize it or not, is a huge deal for those around you who are still closeted and in hiding. It will give them less and less reasons to hide. The single raindrop never feels responsible for the flood, but with your help, I pray that the tide will turn sooner.

My experience calling the SOS hotline,236,9jmtwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9jmtwq/my_experience_calling_the_sos_hotline/,55,2018-09-29 05:12:37,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I felt like I had to get this off my chest as it's been haunting me for too long.(Also in response to the recent increase in suicide cases being reported.)

I believe I suffer from anxiety of some sort. I've never been diagnosed because I'm too chicken shit to get my parents to bring me to a clinic but I do have my fair share of panic attacks at night (hyperventilating until I get breathless and have to use my inhaler because I'm asthmatic, overly sweaty, dizzy etc.)

Usually I get through it with the help of my friends. But during that period, we had just received our A level results. Being the only one with decent grades in my group of friends (my other friends scored less than 70) I felt it would be rude of me to call them up for help when they have so much more to deal with on their hands.

I was feeling pretty helpless at that point. Various things escalated and I got into a huge argument with my parents and siblings. I have never been close to any of my family members as I've always felt out of place with them. It's a long story but the environment I have at home isn't the best. 

A lot of things escalated and on that night, I truly felt like taking my own life. As a last resort,  I thought I'd call up the Samaritans of Singapore. That's when shit went downhill. 

The lady who answered my call was pretty sweet at first, told me to breathe and stuff. She asked me why I'm crying and I told her I didn't know. I told her that I'm having a panic attack and she asked if I had anything I could do to help myself. I told her I was never diagnosed with it medically before. 

She asked me if I was feeling suicidal and I said no. Note that it was kinda really hard to answer her questions considering how hard I was sobbing. I told her no, which was a lie. I mean I obviously didn't need her to call the police on me or some shit. So she asked me again why I was crying.  

I honestly couldn't answer her with how hard I was sobbing but I wanted someone to tell be that everything will be OK. I wanted someone to tell me that things will get better, and I just have to be stronger. 

She told me she couldn't understand me over my sobbing and to call back again 10 minutes later. At this, I was pretty damn shocked and I cried even more because I'm a big baby. 

I was desperate at that point pretty much. I just really needed a soothing voice to help me pick myself up. I knew I wanted to take my life but I knew that I wanted to give life a second try at the same time. So I tried,  and I really did try my best to open up to her regarding all of the problem I was facing, how it all escalated and led to one big mess and how I have no one to turn to. 

Anyway, part of the whole list of issues was about how I have privacy issues with my family. The operator defended my parents saying that they had the right to know everything about me. And OK, maybe I didn't elaborate my problems enough but it's kinda hard when you're constantly sobbing and you can't breathe very well. 

So I told the operator that I have major trust issues because of my anxiety and that I was was they didn't respect my privacy more even though I told them to. The operator then told me to just not tell them anything and that this shouldn't be an issue since I'm opening up to her when she's a stranger. At that point I started getting a little bit pissed which made me cry even more to the point that I couldn't even get a single word out of my mouth. 

The fact that she's a stranger is exactly the reason why I'm opening up to her. She can't see me and I can't see her. She can only know me. She doesn't know my name, doesn't know my background, doesn't know anything about me so there would be no prior judgement. Yes, she is a stranger but an anonymous stranger was exactly the person I thought I needed to talk to. Someone who could give me advice from an outsider's perspective and who doesn't and won't know anything about my identity. But maybe it's just wishful thinking. Judgement exists everywhere. 

She asked me how old I was and I told her that I'm 19. She told me that she didn't believe me (probably implying that I sounded immature). I was shocked nonetheless but I tried to explain myself. But really, why the heck would I ever have to prove my age to her in this situation? 

I told her I just finished my A levels. She then asked me if i meant o levels instead. Now I know I sound pretty incoherent from sobbing constantly but don't you think I still have enough brains not to confuse the two together?

As I sobbed even harder she started getting impatient and told me she couldn't understand me at all, and to call back later when I've calmed down. Now excuse me if I'm wrong but aren't you, as a hotline that it supposed to provide emotional support do the exact opposite of that? I'm calling you precisely because I am NOT calm. 

In the end, she told me to seek help from family services and gave me a list of places that I can seek counselling from. I told my friends about it the next day and they wrote an email to the Samaritans of Singapore on my behalf. They replied to them to apologise and said that they would let the supervisor know, and asked for a name if I happened to catch any. I wasn't sure if there was any other correspondence that happened after that as I was too chicken shit to pry further. 

There isn't much of a moral to this story. I just felt like I had to share my experience. I'm not sure if this is wanted and I don't think it will help anyone. Do take note that I'm not discouraging anyone to call SOS if they ever need help. Peoples experiences vary and mine just happened to be a particularly shitty one. I know that no good will come out of me sharing this as the issue is long past and I know I should muster the courage to seek professional help. I just felt that this would help me move one to a new chapter in life. 

Honestly, talking to my friends the next day helped me out much more than calling the hotline ever d",123Throwawayyy123,friend suicide
My (21/F) school counsellor (30s/F) molested me,200,9hygl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9hygl3/my_21f_school_counsellor_30sf_molested_me/,66,2018-09-23 01:32:44,"This happened when I was in my first year of secondary school so I was 12 turning 13. I was having having my first psychosis episode (wasn’t diagnosed yet but I have bipolar). I had insomnia and was hearing voices. I was doing very badly in school, I couldn’t focus in class and was punished by my Teachers for not completing homework, resting my head on the table in class and daydreaming. One day, my teacher came up to me and asked me if anything was wrong. I told her I couldn’t sleep and that I was hearing voices. She then referred me to the school counsellor. 

The counsellor was a female with short curly hair. She was very nice and well liked by the students. Me and my Friends would hang out at her office and just talk to her during recess. So I felt like I could trust her. 

The first few sessions were fine until one day, I entered her room and she locked the door. She closed the blinds and turned off the lights. I was sitting on the sofa and she sat on the table really close to me, our knees touching. She kept saying “it’s going to be okay” and proceeded to rub up and down my thighs and under my skirt. 

I couldn’t move. At that age, I didn’t know what was happening. I thought all counsellors did that. She eventually stopped, and told me to leave and she locked the door behind her. The next day, I told my teacher that I tried to commit suicide and she told my counsellor. The counsellor sent me away to the mental hospital. The next 4 years I spent in the school, she would try and avoid me unable to look me in the eyes. 

It really fucked me up because the person who was supposed to help me, hurt me. 

I am now 21 and studying to be a counsellor. I want to be the person I needed when i was younger and to prove that she was a poor excuse of a counsellor. 

Recently, I was asked by my social worker if I wanted to make a police report. I said no, because it has been such a long time ago but I worry that she has been doing that to other kids. What do you thin",badchab,friend suicide
TIL that suicide is the leading cause of death for those 10-29 years old,223,9jktq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9jktq8/til_that_suicide_is_the_leading_cause_of_death/,37,2018-09-28 23:11:27,"Source: [https://www.sos.org.sg/learn-about-suicide/quick-facts](https://www.sos.org.sg/learn-about-suicide/quick-facts)

Felt compelled to share this after I learnt that a friend (not very close but was okay with him) recently committed suicide after an episode of depression. Thing is, he seemed okay. Even his Facebook was full of photos of him hanging out with his friends, his social club (he played soccer with some team for those Sunday leagues), etc. etc. I was really shocked to hear that he struggled with depression for a while. He didn't seem to show it.

There was a point in my life too where I had struggled with depression. After a particularly tough and gruelling semester at uni, I went through what was termed a brief psychotic episode where I was not myself, and I did some pretty weird things that confused my friends and family. Sad to say, I did contemplate ending my own life.

Fortunately I was able to receive the help and treatment that I needed to recover. Happy to say that I think I am pretty much okay now, but I do remember that when you're going through a toll on your mental health, sometimes it really does not show on the outside. In fact, it was only when one of my best friends asked me if I was okay, did I open up and share and he could help me get the treatment I needed.  I must thank all my friends and family for helping me through that period, and I truly am grateful that I have an overwhelmingly supportive family and friends base that believed in me even when I didn't.

Long story short, remember that sometimes depression doesn't always show up on the surface. All it takes is a 'are you okay', and you can very well be saving someone's li",nattybattywatty,friend suicide
"(Update) Help me, I have been sexually harassed by my neighbours for three years",742,94oz3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/94oz3t/update_help_me_i_have_been_sexually_harassed_by/,163,2018-08-05 19:29:22,"Hi r/singapore. No fancy writing today because I’m rather exhausted.

Updates:

* Mother of one of the teenage boys DMed me after seeing my post on Facebook. She confirmed that most of the boys sitting at the lift landings are friends of her son, clarified that she doesn’t stay in Singapore (like I mentioned, there’s an overcrowding issue in that flat so I guess her son is taken care by her siblings/mother/cousins) and sounded sincerely apologetic. She told me she‘ll speak to her son and asked if she could speak to my mom and I separately face-to-face when she visits Singapore.
* When my boyfriend sent me home last night, one of the teenage boys were standing at the lift landing. He looked about 18 and was accompanied by 2 kids significantly shorter than him. I believe the kids are aged 5-7. I listened to some of the suggestions given here, and glared back at him instead of looking down. After we walked into my unit, the boy shouted, “Cheebye!” We didn’t respond. After a while, he shouted again, “This mother fucker posted videos of us!” My boyfriend was obviously, and rightfully, agitated but I told him to not respond. Hope I did the right thing.
* Spoke to Shin Min, Zaobao and Wanbao. News is expected to be out today. Sadly, when they came, the boy’s mother probably already warned them to be quiet so no one was hanging around. We still got some photos, and I also sent them previous photos/videos I took. I think I did okay during the interview, considering how nervous I used to be when talking to strangers when I was younger.
* I know I told some redditors via PM that I’ll give an update after the news is out. I’m so sorry but I changed my mind. I don’t want to read the article. I don’t know what’s gonna be reported and I think I need to take a break from this for mental health reasons. I experienced panic attacks and I’m super worn out from having to defend, explain and justify myself. Not asking for pity here, just to clarify. I’m just tired and rather defeated. It breaks my heart reading the many private messages I’ve been receiving on Facebook regarding other stories of harassment too. It’s true that negativity sucks up your energy.
* People casted doubt over my statements so much that I started questioning myself too. Did I blow things out of proportion? Did I ruin their lives? I can’t live with that. At some point, I asked my boyfriend if I did wrong. He assured me that I did what I have to do because I deserved to feel safe. I guess. I just keep telling myself that if I did not lie about anything, then there’s no need to be afraid of what people say about me.
* A lot of people asked if I went to so-and-so organisations. I’m going through the list and there are a few options I haven’t thought of, like AWARE. Some asked about my plan. I honestly didn’t expect the post to go viral. I thought it’ll garner about 100 shares on Facebook, and 10-20 replies on Reddit like most of my previous posts. The plan was to then take the posts to my MP during meet-the-people session after I end my school semester next week and see how it turns out. Now I’m gonna keep watch of the situation outside my house and approach them when/if needed.
* My words has been, inevitably, twisted by some people. When I wrote, “My mom is a hawker,” some people took it as my mom owns a hawker centre, or a stall. I have since clarified that with the reporters who asked.
* People on FB asked what I wore/wear. I chose to ignore those questions because it’s irrelevant. That’s like saying someone deserves to be robbed because they return home late.
* Someone asked about me travelling. I‘m clarifying here so I don’t have to repeat myself. Some of the trips were work trips, and those that aren’t, are very tightly budgeted. E.g. Bringing snacks from home to save on a meal, eating only one meal overseas, walking up to 50 minutes everywhere. I also explained on my blog how I managed my finances. Basically, I live frugally, I save and work a lot. Freelance designing, part time jobs, event jobs — everything that comes my way. Please look at my blog if you still have any questions: [https://pekyj.blogspot.com/2018/08/ayeee-its-me.html](https://pekyj.blogspot.com/2018/08/ayeee-its-me.html)
* Lastly, I privatised my Instagram. Not because I’m guilty but because I know people are going to keep searching, and my mom and boyfriend are really private people. I don’t think it’s fair for people to discuss about them when I am the one involved. I don’t know why people (on FB, not here) keep bringing up boyfriend. As if my boyfriend doesn’t have a life outside of me. He can’t be here 24/7, he has his own family and he has to work too.

I read almost every comment in my last thread but I’m really drained of energy right now. Thank you for all the support and for believing my words, even when I couldn’t provide evidence of the harassment. It’s a he-said-she-said situation and I would have understood if you think I’m lying so I’m really, really grateful that you chose to believe me. I also if I made some of you doubt my statements or that everything seems fake and orchestrated.

I hope you know that I am immensely thankful for every comment. I hope it’s okay that I take a few days off to focus on my final assignments and test before coming back to reply.

Thank you once again.

Edit:

Update 2:

* As [u/suicide\_aunties](https://www.reddit.com/u/suicide_aunties) suggested, I manned up and read the news report to make sure everything was accurate. It's on zaobao online, shin min and wanbao. All's good. Wanbao included an interview with the family who, predictably, denied they ever harassed me. They also claimed their gatherings stopped after 10pm. Doesn't matter though, because I think with media attention, hopefully (but I've been wrong before), the MPs will take us seriously.
* I spent some time with my mom and brother, who made my day so much better.
* I bumped into them downstairs and they started hurling vulgarities at me. Their grandma was also present.
* But we also bumped into a couple of neighbours who told me to find them if more problem arises :')
* When we returned home, one of the kids were sleeping outside. He woke up to glare at us. As we were walked by, he kicked a chair after us. Thankfully, I turned on my audio recording in the lift so I now have audio, pictorial and video evidence of him throwing the chair. My mom and him had some confrontation in Malay (she asked whether he's indignant and he said he was yadda yadda). Then he called his mom, who was the lady who messaged me.
* I messaged his mom when I got home, told her what happened, including her mom letting her kids hurl vulgarities at me. She wanted the video, which I promptly sent. She seems really apologetic after that. Some other family members are still defending his behaviour on Facebook, even after watching the video.

Depressed about future prospects,233,868w56,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/868w56/depressed_about_future_prospects/,173,2018-03-22 20:29:54,"Long story short, my dad suffered a major stroke 2 years ago which left him bedridden in a nursing home and I rage quit my job 1 year ago. My father lost all his asset gambling in his younger days so he had no asset to his name and I have been living with his two sisters (unmarried, my aunts). Normally I should not have to worried about this, but it turns out my Dad only had $2 in his bank account after gambling the CPF he withdrew at our world class casino. He didn't have much insurance because he cancelled them to save on premiums. For what he had, Aviva denied his claim because they claim he false declared his health status on application (many years ago) and will thus ""eat"" his premium and terminate the policy. The only thing I managed to claim successfully was the DPS and Eldershield thanks to NTUC, but it was after a lengthy one year process to obtain all the ""funny"" documents they needed. Apparently taking care of a mentally incapacitated person is harder than taking care of a dead person, thanks to red tapes everywhere. You don't just walk and say, I am the son and expect everything to fall into place. There is no one unified system at all.

Nonetheless, there was a whole lot of drama in the first year of his stroke due to the hospital, social workers and incapable relatives that requires me to attend to every single thing like I own the company, and I can take time off anytime I want to be a good son like on television. Eventually I was so burn out that everything finally forced me to rage quit my job after a falling out with management. Stuck in a contract was horrible enough but they were so eager to take advantage of the fact that I needed the job and money, instead of negotiating properly. I also dropped out of private uni because I needed cash flow to pay for all of my father's bills and that Kaplan was insensitive to my predicament by not allowing partial refund of my paid fees. Instead asking me to pay the full amount again when I am ready to re-module. I didn't take that well, so I did not extend the deferment. *Let's not say I did not try to get my degree, ok?* My dad rather gamble than fund my studies and when I finally saved enough for further studies, I need to pay for his medical needs. I was screwed over hard, and ultimately no money means no paper degree no matter how talented I may be. I even tried to negotiate with the company to send me for training on company time, but its always no training budget for contract staffs. And then the usual, if you go training on company time, then what we hire you for? During my years in the company, never once was I send for training. When there is a new project, they just hire someone to implement it instead of giving me the opportunity. And when its implemented, I get a few power point slides and magically I'm qualified to support the new system. It really is vomit blood.

Although I was jobless for a year, the nice thing was that I was able to get everything settled personally like the good son I should be. Or at least, I thought it should be. But it turns out that putting him in a nursing home does not entirely resolve me of my problem. He has so many medical appointments that requires me to follow up, and if I don't attend, there are funny cases where medication is missing or not collected from the hospital. Or the appointment rescheduled to another time so I can attend. I don't really know whose fault this is since the excuse I keep hearing is that **""Sorry, I don't speak English so I cannot understand""**, so I need to be the one to take care of everything, because once again... I am the son. This keeps taking up my time and I cannot rid myself of them, so this becomes a problem when I want to find a new job. My education level is only up to Diploma and that limits my options. The roles I quality for are pretty much IT Helpdesk / Technicians which don't really have a work life balance option due to over-outsourcing. Pay wise, they are only around $2.6k and it is pretty much a dead end career, so there is no progression path. Having to pay for my father's needs and eventually his 2 sisters as they get older, with this salary really puts me at a lost. 

I have a D7 in O'lv math and that is what really screw me over big time but unless I am really that bad at math, I absolutely do not see how I can start a family (If I even have that option) and take care of everyone with a low salary. The reason I need to take care of his 2 sisters is that they took care of me when my father didn't and they took out their savings to pay off my father's gambling debts, which he didn't even brother returning to them when he withdrew his CPF. Even now, when I am not working, for some strange reasons the government's means testing suggest that I can afford to pay $1200++ a month for my father's nursing home and this is excluding all his other medicines and specialist appointments. He has over 20+ medications and among them are anti depressive pills which I don't even have the luxury of taking. As much as I can, I have tried to make ends mean but at some point in time... there is only so much one can do. Social workers I spoke to are like, well live for yourself, not for others. Find a girlfriend! But i look at my situation and I don't exactly see how I even have the luxury to live for myself. If anything, I don't know of any girl in Singapore that would even consider my position as potential boyfriend material. The truth is, I have been fighting by myself for the last 30 years without anyone to seek advise from. Friends? Let's just say, its different from television. Everyone has their own problem and their broken fingernail is more important. The best you can get out of anyone is pretty much, a listening ear on whatsapp and some **""You can do it! You should come to church and donate for Jesus's blessing.""** 

I don't blame anyone though and this really issn't a rant post. I appreciate everyone that has been in my life, whether good or bad *(everything is a learning experience)* but ultimately, there is only so much you can beat out of a dead horse. After considering all possible options, I truly believe that ending my life and letting the government take care of my family's needs might be the best logical choice. Alternatively, I can rob the bank and get myself caught intentionally so I can get some free re-skilling opportunities in jail. Maybe when I come out, I can become some story teller with a very dramatic bestseller book to fund my retirement. To be honest, I don't know what I am expecting from this post, but this is in a way my attempt at screaming for help. Whether I deserve help or how much help I truly deserve, I don't know. Counselors always tell stories where family of 4 struggle with a household income of $2k, and they live a very happy, satisfied life so I will be just fine if I try. But how true is this story really? The bright side is that maybe the hubby can have sex with his wife to destress, but I can't fuck anyone in my family to destress. Maybe the 2 kids will grow up and help to support the family, but my situation aren't even that. I honestly feel that, I have reached the end of the crossroad and this is the end of my bloodline. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't go pub/club, I haven never even gone on overseas vacation, never took a plane before, I save whatever I can. I don't even go to cinemas. I'm not even fat, I eat a very cheap diet that puts me a little underweight but where did this effort ultimately took me? A boring person with an unattractive lifestyle that no Singaporean girls will want to date, and a aging family to take care of. Honestly, where is my future? I don't see any. To be honest, I may not have the budget to spurge on dates even if a girl want me. Singapore is just very plain straight forward. **""Bo money ah? Die lor. I only got one life, you want? Come take it la.""**

Its a pretty long post, much longer than I expected and I thank you if you have read everything. In a way, I felt better after getting this out. If you are responding though, I have a question. If you were in my position, what would you have done? Would suicide really not be the most educated option?

**PS: Pls don't suggest investing in cryptocurrencies. I deleted my bitcoin and doge wallet in 2010.**

**Big Edit:** So there are alot of comments way more than I expected and I appreciate all support. I'm not really that responsible a person like some of you think. It is just that, I try to be a good samaritan and so I pick up the slack here and there, and somehow eventually things became so dependent on me that whose else is going to do it, if not me? I'm forced into where I am today not because I want to. I have actually very much considered disavowing my father and then migrating and abandoning everyone for the greater good. If Singapore was bigger, I would most certainly not hesitate to move to another city. Its just that my whole plan was pretty much, once I settled everything. I would kill myself so in a way that was the master plan. I rage quit my job because I knew I didn't need to put up with shit anymore if I am going to die soon. But things wouldn't settle, and it dragged so long to the point where one day I suddenly feel so lonely that I say, maybe I need to do something, walk out of this darkness and attempt to go back to society. But then I have no real plan for it, or maybe I have but I dunno if its a good plan, a bad plan or another disastrous mistake just waiting to happen.

There's alot of suggestions in here and I thank you very much. Its true that if I don't suicide, there can be many options out and some of these options involves ignoring the future ahead and then praying that things will work out eventually. That once I get a job, everything will be better. But the real problem here is, and what I can't solve in my head is which I will elaborate further is that instead of saving money every month, all the money goes into my Dad's nursing home and medical bills. Now my aunts don't make much, so its hard for them to chip in much when they also have their own medical issues. So the bulk falls on me but still we get by. Just that nobody saves any money at the end of each month, and pray that the existing savings don't get touched. Why? Because my aunt will need those money themselves when they grow older and retire. So this puts things in a very weird cycle, especially given how I have achieved nothing in life thus far. So I pay, we pay until my Dad dies and he dies a happy man, well cared for and everyone think I am such a good son. Then my aunts turn come and oh because I was so capable of handling things before, people's expectation would be that ""oh, i'm sure he can do it again"". So yup, let's do it again. Then eventually everyone dies, leaving me alone without any savings, career or well... let's not say family. I don't want to make this into a sobbing story of ""I cannot find a girlfriend because I have no money!!"". So well, what do I do? I assume I would be in my late 60s or early 70s by then and I don't expect my health to be 100% perfect so... I die to join everyone in the afterlife.

I feel very sad when I think it that way, but I need not be that sad because things haven't played out yet. That's what many are telling me. But I dunno how to ignore something that will eventually happen anyway. Thus, it is just a simple matter of whether I die now in my 30s or i die later in my 70s. Either way, I die as a failure. But its not ""right"" to tell say **""Yes Gram, pls go and kill yourself. I fully support your decision.""** so they say, don't worry. Things will work out. But how will things work out? I ask them, they dunno. I ask myself, I dunno. So... what then? It seems like just delaying the inevitable to me.

If I disavow everyone, np. I just restart my life plain and simple, reach 35 buy my own house and throw a house warming party, impregnate my neighbour's daughter by mistake and I start my own family chapter. And I die in my 70s as a successful husband, good father and someone to be ""proud"" of. But do I need to start my own family? Not really. Do I need a girlfriend? Not really. Do I need sex? Not really. They are all luxury, not a necessity. So I choose to sacrifice myself, but then I feel suicidal and ya the cycle begins again. I'm not a dumb person and by no means have I not considered the possibilities. But what I have considered may not be big enough, since there are options that I am unaware of or misunderstood and that it aren't as bad as I painted it. Ok, I am open to explore it but if the advise is just ""Get a job Gram, that's your first step and then start saving!"". That is a pointless advice imo, no matter how reasonable it is because it just puts me back to square one. I am not trying to sound unappreciative btw, I am just frustrated at being looked upon like an idiot.

**Edit 2:** Based on the comments, I realized that from my friends' perspective, I am the dead weight so that might be why they aren't ""helping"", just act like things will resolve by itself. Well, I can afford to disavow these friends. Thanks for helping me to realize this!

**Edit 3:** Going through all the suggestions and private messages, I am suddenly feeling very overwhelmed by what needs to be done and what I should be doing. My head hurts really bad and I am starting to regret asking for help when I am not ready to be helped. It is all reminding me what I should have or should not done for a better life, and why I wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Now I remember why I concluded it was easier to simply restart a new life and make sure I do it correctly the next time. Sorry guys, I don't think I can do it anymore. I think things just got worse after asking for he",GramTooNoob,friend suicide

~~“Narration” features a unique collection that focuses on life. Believing that life is precious, Outsider takes us on a melancholic journey of how we have taken it for granted. He uses subjects and words that are simple and recognizable but presented with a distorted view; and beneath the seemingly simplicity lies a deeper theme. Extinction, solitude, stress, or materialism, are the narratives that are often used in the concept for each work.~~

~~[HUMAN+ ""PERFECTING HUMANITY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY""](https://www.sistic.com.sg/events/chuman0917)~~

~~""Human+” - first staged in 2014 - is returning with a new script to confront the evolving landscape of Transhumanism Technology: the synergy of machine and man. As we knock on the doors to our next era of humanity, the ethics of allowing ourselves to be dependent on machines and systems has become much more crucial within the last three years alone.~~

~~[GERMINAL](https://www.sifa.sg/sifa/programme/shows/germinal/) - A part of the [SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS 2017](https://www.sifa.sg/sifa/programme/shows/)~~

~~One of the most talked-about, amusing performances in recent years, Germinal uses the theatre as a whimsical metaphor for human civilisation. A deconstructionist performance if ever there was one, Germinal peels away the smoke and mirrors that accompany the usual theatre-going experience. By stripping away and breaking down, then building anew and crafting afresh, Germinal lightly encourages us to rethink all the things we thought we knew and relook at them with a fresh eye.~~

~~In an interactive video installation, the protagonist on the evening news looks directly at the viewer, providing a framework for each viewer to scrutinise his or her own feelings of discomfort. Dutch theatre-maker and visual artist Dries Verhoeven asks us: What if the people we watch on the news can look back at us? What if the gaze is reversed?~~

~~Guilty Landscapes III transports images of uncomfortable responsibility into the white cube of a gallery. In the otherwise empty space, a disconcerting landscape is projected on a large wall. As soon as a viewer steps into the room, he or she becomes an integral part of the installation. Every viewer experiences a truly individualised connection to the situation on screen. Suddenly, feelings of distance and proximity seem to merge.~~

[NIGHT VISIONS - A solo exhibition by South Korean artist JIEUN PARK](http://www.redseagallery.com/exhibitions/night-visions)

Park's distinctive style blends large brushstrokes and splatters of ink with detailed depictions of urban landscapes at night. While capturing the excitement and magic of various cities – among these, for example, are Hong Kong, Singapore, London and New York – the works also reveal a more subdued, contemplative narrative. Through her paintings, Park hints at a paradox of urban life – being surrounded by thousands of people, yet feeling utterly alone.

Moving beyond flat surfaces, Hong investigates the possibility of the 3D in ink painting, boldly reconstructing surface textures to expand our views of Chinese ink traditions through paper reliefs, challenging the definition of space that is unlimited by medium and dimension.

(I'm posting this on a friend's behalf.)

My friend has been going through some serious mental health issues and has sought therapy at IMH, which she says doesn't work for her. Now, she has decided to go to SCAPE's Mental Health services for counselling as a last-ditch attempt.

The thing is, when you register at SCAPE, they ask you to put someone as an emergency contact, and she put my number as the contact because her family is against her seeking help and will react with physical abuse if they find out she went to SCAPE. (I've already told her to report her family to the police but she refuses.) But I'm still legally a minor (I turn 18 only later this year).

My question is: under what circumstances will SCAPE contact me? I'm under the impression that they'll only call me if my friend attempts suicide or something equally drastic. I was honestly reluctant to be put as an emergency contact because I know what I can do for her is very limited as I'm a minor without any resources of my own, and I'm very worried I might be called down to the police station or something to sign legal things that I don't understand. (I know that sounds very far-fetched but that just illustrates how little I know about how the SCAPE Mental Health Services function.)

TL;DR: Under what circumstances will SCAPE mental health services contact the emergency contact? Do they have the power to tell the police what the patient has told th",yoosungtome,friend suicide

Money seems to be one of the biggest issues, but it really shouldn’t be. Currently, my own treatment's tapering off, so I can comfortably fund another person (and maybe two, if I really tighten my purse strings) on subsidized treatment in government hospitals for a while.  

Absolutely no strings attached here. I just want you to know that you owe yourself your well-being. The first step is to seek help. I can remove the financial barrier for one of you, whoever comes first. PM me.

Edit: I have found someone whom accepted my help. Thanks to all those who commented and PM-ed me offering to contribute to a common pool. Tbh I don't have the ability and brains to manage the funds. The burden would also be too heavy for me. I do hope that /r/Singapore will be able to identify a trustable charity where all these good intentions can go to.

[Serious] I need help with my GF.,32,3e398z,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3e398z/serious_i_need_help_with_my_gf/,62,2015-07-22 08:55:09,"Ok so throwaway account, but I really appreciate the advise.

Background story, my GF is in her 20s. She just graduated with a degree, she's looking for a full-time job while currently doing freelance jobs to save up money. We have been together for more than 6 years. She's the youngest in the family.


So what I need help with? I suspect that my GF is slowly becoming depressed. Her family is a train-wreck, with her parents the main cause of it. Both her parents are in the retail business. They rent shops and sell clothes that cater to aunties, and (try) young adults too. They are **very** money-minded. Her mother has a very harsh mouth. E.g. When my GF spends money, her mother will say ""Wah someone a lot of money huh, can buy new things."" in a *very* sarcastic tone. Note: My GF buys those things 80% of the time using her **own** money she saved up from her freelance jobs. She seldom takes money from her parents because she does not want to give her mother an opportunity to berate her. Meanwhile her eldest brother who is in his 30s and **jobless* asks for money to buy the latest MacBook and iPad, she would give without saying a single word. You may deem this as being bias, I would say.

Ok so you may kinda get the picture (and sorry for the digress) but the main thing here is, my GF tried to commit suicide. What forced her to do so was her mother told my GF that (I kissed my GF's best friend during my GF's birthday party). Now this accusation was 100% false. My GF knows it and she believes me too. However she has a very bad temper and anger management so naturally she gets into a shouting match with her mother. One thing leads to another and due to her anger she decided to grab her penknife and 'wanted to kill her mother before ending her life'. Fortunately she did not but she locked herself in the room instead and threaten to commit suicide. Police was called, she was taken away but luckily we managed to convince the police it wasn't a suicide case hence she wasn't put in jail so no records. 

She feels that she isn't part of the family. I try to say things that doesn't make her feel that way but I'm not strong in this area. I do need help in this area too, like how to comfort her, etc. 

Currently I don't know what other information to include so if I didn't specify anything do ask. And thanks in advance.

More help to battle depression,12,4g1b5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4g1b5o/more_help_to_battle_depression/,14,2016-04-23 16:31:30,"I originally posted an AMA, but it was removed by the moderators. Hopefully my new approach will be better suited for this subreddit.

Even with the various avenues of help and awareness available here in Singapore, we still hear of suicides and hardships faced by people with depression. Every life is precious. We need to do everything we can to save lives, and more people to voice their success stories which can help others and motivate them to not give up. Because of the personal and complex nature of depression, conventional treatment is not effective for everyone. Use my advice below as a last resort; PROFESSIONAL HELP SHOULD ALWAYS BE SOUGHT FIRST.

I started getting depressed on my first day of Secondary One, because my PSLE score was not good enough for me to go to the school I wanted. I was younger at that time, so I could not foresee how severe my condition would become. Come Secondary 4, I just could not cope with the stress from O Levels. I went to see my GP who referred me to the CGC. There, I was prescribed medication and skipped classes to attend therapy sessions but neither were effective. I became so lethargic that I could hardly get up from bed and couldn't study at all. I had no choice but to stop treatment and focus on my improving my poor grades (my L1R5 was 32 for prelims). Things were not looking up for me.

Nevertheless, I did my best for my Os and managed to enter a polytechnic course. I saw this as a new beginning, and an opportunity to start afresh. I was determined to not let depression take control of my life and screw up my studies this time. So I worked hard; I practised, made notes and clarified doubts. This drive to learn, improve and do well was more effective than any treatment I was given. It gave me a sense of purpose and I felt much better than I was last time. 

My efforts paid off; I attained a Diploma with Merit, as well as acceptance into one of the top ranked local universities. Just 3 years ago, I could not have imagined even making it out of secondary school; I actually have a brighter future now. 

**tl;dr:** Find a fresh start and turn your life around.

######Helping those with depression
It is EXTREMELY important to identify signs of depression early to prevent them from worsening. If your friend's posts on social media reflect self-esteem issues or suicidal thoughts, make sure they receive help ASAP. If treatment isn't doing well for them, let them know that there is always a plan B. It is important to build this mind-set in them: do your best and don't give up.

Any opinions/discourse on suicide in Singapore?,7,32k1e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/32k1e0/any_opinionsdiscourse_on_suicide_in_singapore/,44,2015-04-15 04:34:21,"So I did some reading yesterday on the BBC and the 
TL;DR is that suicide is the no.1 killer of men in the UK.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32231774 - BBC article

Among other things, men are 4x as likely to kill themselves compared to women and the article/documentary suggest that it may have something to do with gender (i.e. men are given the role of breadwinners and changing times means they are left unable to fulfil this role).

They also attribute the rate of suicide and the reluctance to seek help to stereotypes of men; supposedly to be 'strong, silent' etc.

Now, I looked at Singapore and it has a few similar conditions as well. 

 - NS can be viewed as gender stratification (for men) and there is a certain degree of masculinity and bravado that comes with it. 

- Criminalization of suicide (S.309 Singapore Penal Code as per wikipedia), I don't know if it's still carried out or dormant. Additionally, there appears to be an urban myth that corpses are 'handcuffed' although I cannot confirm or deny the veracity of such claims (told to me by my uncle long ago and also from Google recently)

-Competitive, meritocratic environment; this is not an attack on meritocracy but my opinion is that it may contribute to suicidal tendencies through the pressure of failure among other things.

Demographically speaking however, more men than women kill themselves in Singapore as well (however it is not 4x as adverse) and the vulnerable group seems to be 20-29 age males (as opposed to UK 40-49).

My questions are as per usual, poorly formatted so pardon me but I would like to know your experience with the subject of suicide in Singapore. What are your theories or personal experience or friends experiences? Additionally what do you think are the reasons that more men kill themselves in Singapore than women? Same as the UK? Or, if you're of the opinion that there is nothing to worry about, why?

In-Depth look at SCDF's fire and rescue side (part 2),51,4yislg,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4yislg/indepth_look_at_scdfs_fire_and_rescue_side_part_2/,0,2016-08-20 05:04:16,"See the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4xzjqa/indepth_look_at_scdfs_fire_and_rescue_side/) here! The first post is general information about SCDF, while this post is a FAQ for people who are interested in various aspects of SCDF. The main purpose of the FAQ is to address the concerns of any new recruits or (impending or new) station personnel.

This was originally combined with the original post, but I was already at the word limit, so I was unable to add new content. Discussions will be split, but I don't think this will be that big of an issue.

---

**FAQ – General Information**

&gt;Are all 21 stations working 24 hours?

Yes. 

---

&gt;Do the people on duty only sleep and wake up to go for calls?

No. This is the most widespread, erroneous and infuriating misconception that people have of us.
Yes, we do rest in our free time, but we do not have a lot of free time. Between all the admin work and training, realistically you’re only talking about 1-3 hours of free time.

---

&gt;How do fire stations operate? In sections? In teams? How do you respond to a fire?

We all have our own sections that are permanent. However, we (or at least the way my station works) is that the vehicle we are attached to every duty will consist of different people. This crew will stick until the end of the duty.
When a major incident happens, multiple vehicles will turn out for the same incident. The crew tends to get jumbled up depending on manpower requirements. In such a situation we work more as an entire Rota (sans the people who aren’t involved in the incident, obviously), with little to no regard for the sections or the vehicle crew makeup.

---

&gt;Are SCDF people all barbarians?

There is no politically correct way to answer this, so I’m just going to come out and say it.
Let us get this fact out of the way first: SCDF is a dumping ground for everyone they do not want in the other organizations that draft from the NSF pool. You will encounter people from all walks of life. Foreigners, people with criminal records, people with relatively low educational qualifications and true blue Singaporeans who, for some reason, are drafted into SCDF anyway.

Back to the question: Are people in SCDF barbaric? I will not give this a straight affirmative, because it implies everyone in SCDF is barbaric. However, I do have to point out that there seems to be a larger proportion of people here who are more… *Rugged*. *Rougher*. *Irreverent*.

(From this point onwards, let me establish the context as a discussion about only fire side personnel). But this is not necessarily a bad thing as it takes a certain type of person to succeed as fire side personnel. We need to get things done extremely quickly. With your facemask, flash hood and helmet on, you’re not going to hear anything. The only way to communicate quickly and accurately is to shout, and shout we do. During scenario drills, it is common to hear someone shouting, whether it is to get someone to do something, or to get someone out of the path of danger. 

People who have more barbaric mannerisms such as this are also not necessarily bad people. Many are fantastic workers, and are ultimately still human. They also have their softer sides. Conversely, you will find well-mannered people here (just like everywhere else) who can’t do anything, shit at maintaining relationships and can’t think of the big picture. 

This brings me to my last point in this question. SCDF is a great place to learn how to work with people very different from you. You learn how to manage different types of people and get them to warm up to you. That is the greatest lesson I have learned here.

---

&gt; Is SCDF very regimental?

SCDF, at its core, is a uniformed group. It also has an entire rank structure. We have footdrills, marching and other nonsense happening here. Somebody that is of higher rank has higher authority than you. If you are a regular, NSFs are supposed to do what you tell them to.

But do we like it? Eh, not really. To many, SCDF is just a job or a place where they serve NS. Given a choice, we will gladly abolish the regimentation. However, regimentation ensures that we keep everyone in check. I have come across NSFs who will step over your head on the first day if you are too nice to them. 

To answer the question, yes, SCDF is regimental, but the regimentation is a necessary evil when you are dealing with such a pool of people (see “Are SCDF people all barbarians?”).

---

&gt;Are there female firefighters?

Yes, and there are a surprising amount of them (although they are still relatively rare). They do not necessarily have lesser strength, and I have met some who are stronger than me. That was not a fun experience.
Just to be clear, I use masculine pronouns consistently to prevent clutter in the post. 

---

&gt;Is SCDF training tough?

All NS training is tough. However, fire side training in SCDF is a different ball game from just cardio fitness. While the army has combat fitness, we have bunker fitness, which is a measure of how well you’re able to function with your bunker gear, BA set and facemask on:

* Are you able to think while extremely fatigued?

* Do you have the endurance to perform tasks (some using heavy equipment) with the additional ~20kg of load on you?
* Are you able to maneuver properly?

Fire side training acclimatizes your body to sweat a lot to dissipate the heat as fast as possible, as your bunker gear is essentially 2 to 3 jackets layered on each other. It frequently leaves our personnel extremely exhausted and sweaty, and heat strokes, while uncommon, are not unheard of. It will take your body a variable amount of time to acclimatize to be able to perform strenuous tasks with your bunker gear on without feeling like your body is burning up inside. It took me 6 to 9 months to not even feel any difference in heat.

There does not seem to be much correlation between cardio fitness and how well you will be able to build up your bunker fitness.

&gt;Is working in SCDF very easy?

No. See the previous question.

If you’re referring to backend vocations, they are more or less the same as those of other organizations. 

If you’re referring to the EMS, also a no. They work 12 hour shifts, but they *really* work that 12 hours. Constant calls to the point of fatigue. It’s not as physically strenuous as firefighting or rescue, but you wouldn’t say a 42km over a few hours at a leisurely jogging pace is easier than a 400m sprint, right?

---

&gt;Are there many Malays in SCDF? I have heard stories and I am concerned.

Yes. The same is true for SPF.

Race does not matter. If you are good at your work, you will be recognized and treated like a brother.

---

&gt;Would you recommend people sign on to SCDF?

Honestly, no. The money is good for any given qualifications, but the amount of work and nonsense you have to put up with is ridiculous. 

Nobody ever stays in SCDF for the passion. People stay because they’re trapped by circumstances. Many sign on for passion, but the fire is quickly dowsed by buckets after buckets of water as you realize that things aren’t what they seem to be from outside.

I also don’t think signing on for the money is really that worth it, especially for non-Diploma holders. I only think it at least breaks even if you’re on some form of scholarship or sponsorship.

Having said that, depending on your secondary appointments, you can do some truly meaningful work. Other than your primary appointment of saving lives and property, you can also ensure safety through enforcing fire safety, community engagements, etc. You get to see that there are people who come for station visits every Saturday who are genuinely interested in what SCDF is all about.

The job is also very stable, and your bonuses and increments are guaranteed. If you’re willing to go all-out for money, then who am I to stop you?

---

&gt;If I sign on, what benefits do I get?

Other than the obvious monetary incentives, you will be sponsored a Class 3 and 4 license (if you do not have them yet). You will also be granted a vocational license allowing you to drive emergency vehicles. Class 2B, 2A and 2 licenses are also sponsored, but they have a waitlist and not everybody can get them (unlike the Class 3 and 4, which are guaranteed). I have been cautioned by some of the colleagues more in the know that going too deep with the Class 2 licenses may end up with you being posted to be a Firebiker. I cannot confirm whether this is true or not.

The Hazmat specialist tag is also valuable because it opens up many doors that allows you to work in Jurong Island, as many of the companies need such specialists. It is therefore a somewhat sought-after specialist track, although if you have no intentions of working in JI, it won't be useful for you.

&gt;What are the different PPEs in SCDF?

* [Bunker gear](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Auxg0pDCMAE2JZ2.jpg) for everyone

* [CA Suit](http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/articles/2014/08/04/suit.jpg) for everyone

* [High Performance Suit]( http://news.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/515x370/public/original_images/Aug2014/SCDFsuitup6.jpg?itok=LUHLX2jK) for the Hazmat specialists

DART specialists work with the normal long 4 uniform.

---

&gt;Is working/serving NS in SCDF fulfilling?

I hesitate to use the word “fulfilling”, but you can be sure we serve the public in more ways than they know. We go for many nonsense calls, and we, along with our SPF colleagues, are the first line of civil defense.

---

&gt;Do SCDF people hate SPF?

While SCDF personnel frequently mock SPF for their inaction during calls, I realized while answering the previous question that this is not justified at all (and hence split this into a separate question). Firstly, whenever we attend calls with SPF, unless it is a suicide incident, we are the incident managers. In essence, what it means is that we have the authority to make calls for most decisions. Correspondingly, these calls are calls that only SCDF people can do something about. Locked doors, fires, rescues, etc. The police do not have any way of helping us.
On the other hand, SPF personnel attend to their own calls that we do not see, and they have other ridiculous bullshit that they have to deal with.

I was once on call with a crew of NPCO personnel. We were waiting for the security guard of a premises to open the door for us, I asked her what life was like (having been so close to being in SPF instead of SCDF). The short answer is that you are almost guaranteed never to be able to leave on time, between the reports and having to surrender their guns.

So, to answer the question, no, SCDF personnel do not hate SPF, but there is animosity by SCDF people towards SPF, and often it is unjustified. 

Am I guilty of it? Until a minute ago, yes. 

Do all SCDF people hate SPF? No.

---

&gt;What role do reservists/ORNSmen play in responding to incidents?

None whatsoever.

No, really. The higher management wants to believe that they are playing an active role, and have been actively trying to integrate them into station response, but the brutal truth is that it will take many more years before they can even think about cultivating a suitable culture for this.

Besides, as long as there are people who think derogatorily of NS, even in some aspects (read: there will always be such people, including yours truly), these NSmen will not cooperate. They are all here because they are bound by the law.

---

&gt;How technology-oriented is SCDF?

SCDF prides itself (almost mistakenly; you will see why later) on innovation and leverage on technology. In some ways it is justified, because every few years there will be new technology that will be implemented in an effort to make our lives easier.

More often than not though, it doesn't, and it actually makes it harder. I will give some examples that are very relevant.

RFID was implemented into the Force a few years back. The idea of RFID is that it allows you to quickly see if there are any equipment which are missing from the appliance that you are checking. Here's why it gives none of its purported benefits and is a hindrance *every single* duty:

* We need to check the operational readiness of the major equipment. Just by doing so we can see whether the equipment is missing or not

* The RFID technology used is a little sketchy. 80% of the time it will work fine, but the other 20% of the time it either requires fumbling to get scanned (which is fine, honestly), or just outright cannot be scanned

* RFID requires a daily report that is sent up to headquarters. This becomes a permanent task that one guy has to do, and another thing that the RCs and CsFS have to worry about

* RFID has to be 100%. The problem is due to certain issues with the system (which I won't expound on because I am not familiar with it, having had the good luck not to have to deal with the system), we have to find ways to make it 100%. 

* Between all the problems, RFID takes a minimum of 1 to 1.5 hours to complete every duty. That eats into training and rest time.

Another one that I've recently had to struggle with is the tap in and tap out system for our reservists. This actually uses SAP (which I've had the opportunity to use while I was on internship in Poly), which is a fine software, really. It actually uses the same systems that many other places use for ensuring proper attendance. 

The problem is twofold: reservists are given a reporting and knocking off time which is pretty bullshit, and they are more... ""flexible"", I should say. 

This means that one person in the Rota always has to tap them in and out manually. Obviously they won't bother to do it themselves, because why should they? When they don't, obviously the station will get the brunt of the consequences once HQ starts inquiring.

**FAQ – Training Matters**

&gt;I didn’t choose to be in SCDF. What should I know about SCDF?

You will start your training in the National Service Training Institute (NSTI) either in PTP or BRT, depending on whether you have gotten silver for your NAPFA. Once you complete the entire BRT phase, you will be posted to different vocations.

---

&gt;What vocations are available to NSFs in SCDF?

* Provost

* Driver

* Storeman

* Clerk (which branches out into many other designations, depending on your department)

* Firefighter

* Section Commander

* NSTI Instructor

* CDA Instructor

* K9

---

&gt;What is X vocation like?

Unfortunately, I do not have experience in many of them (and that is also the reason why the focus of this post slants heavily towards the firefighting and rescue aspect of SCDF). I do not wish to perpetuate any rumours of the different vocations that I have heard, as there is no way for me to affirm their veracity. Perhaps this will attract enough people from SCDF that you will be able to ask for advice on other vocations.

---

&gt;I don’t want to go to station. Can I choose to be an instructor instead?

Yes, and while I think station life has been a blast, I will not encourage or discourage this decision. I spent my entire 6 months dreading station life. Ultimately, whether you are granted your wish is up to the recommendation of your instructors and DRC in CDA.

---

&gt;Is what I heard about Yishun true?

Yes, but things have changed. I am not in Yishun, but management relevant to their personnel has changed. Their division commander, CFS, RC and DRC are all different now. Remnants of the culture will inevitably still bleed into current times, but it is my opinion that they are not the hellhole that they used to be (or people used to make them out to be).

[Someone from Yishun want to confirm this?]

---

&gt;What are my chances of being selected for fire side training?

If you’re PES A or B, you’re almost guaranteed to be selected.

---

&gt;Is FFC, SCC and RCC stay-in?

Yes.

---

**FAQ – Station Matters**

&gt;How did you adjust to the 24/48 hour shift?

First of all, once you settle down in station, you will be resting in the afternoon. Settle down refers to a few months into your stint with your station. Try this when you're the new guy and I guarantee you will make many enemies without even saying a word.

Other than that, you will sleep at night. NSFs will have it a bit worse because you need to man the sentry. Most likely you will be given ungodly hours to man when you're still new, like ~3am. Guys in divisional stations (see part 1 for a list of divisional stations) have it better because there are provost guys who will man the station for you.

Regardless, you have your 2 off days to rest. You usually only need to nap on your first off. I usually nap about 3 hours, which should be sufficient. The trick is to make sure you get ample rest on your duty. Free time after night lecture? Sleep early. Don't engage in activities like playing games, playing with your phone, etc. I try to aim to sleep at 10+ so that I don't have to spend so much of my off day sleeping. Keep it for your hobbies, going out with friends and family, etc.

---

&gt;What is station routine like?

Officially, duty is from 8am to 8am. However, you will fall in before 8am, and you will leave station earliest by 9am the next day as you need to hand over your equipment to the incoming Rota. The official routine as provided by the ops department can be found below. We follow it quite closely.

* 0745hrs: Fall in

* 0800hrs to 0900hrs: Equipment check

* 0900hrs to 1000hrs: Equipment drill

* 1000hrs to 1345hrs: Operational routine

* 1345hrs: Fall in

* 1345hrs to 1700hrs: Operational routine

*1700hrs to 1900hrs: Physical training

*2000hrs to 2100hrs: Night lecture

*2100hrs to 0545hrs: Free time

*0545hrs: Fall in

*0600hrs to 0700hrs: Chemical Agent Acclimatization Drill (doing training in CA suit)

*0700hrs to 0800hrs: BTM or baris

The only time you are ever allowed to deviate from the routine *slightly* is when it is a weekend (and sometimes not even then, and rightly so), or if it is a public holiday.

---

&gt;How does the Rota shift compare to office hours?

The shift is a double-edged sword, if it's anything.

The Rota shift essentially compresses your work and off into two very distinct phases for every 3 days cycle. Because you work 24 hours every 3 days, it means you are essentially working 8-5 for all days. Kind of the same as office hours. However, you also need to take into account the fact that office hour workers also have a 48 hours on Saturday and Sunday. This means you are basically working 8 hours for the entire week without rest. Of course, the comparison is a little lopsided, because you don't work the *entire* duty. The most obvious example is your sleeping time at night.

In terms of leave, you only win. Every time you take leave, you will have 5 days of unbroken offs (2 off days from the 1st 3 day cycle + the entire 2nd 3 day cycle). Every 24 hours of leave is covered by 2 vacation days. Considering that you can cover three 8-hours with only 2 vacation days, you earn in this aspect. This is by far my favourite part about the Rota shift.

Because you only have to commute once every 3 days, the amount of money that you spend on mandatory public transport (i.e for work) is divided by three. You will really have a lot of time to run errands, do your own things, go out with friends, etc. The downside is it is quite difficult to plan an outing, because while you may be free, your friends or family may not, especially if they have their own schedules.

Your Rota doesn't change (unless of course you're posted to somewhere else, or shit goes down and you request/are posted to a new Rota/station). Duty in, duty out, you're going to be working, eating, shitting, sleeping and playing with the same people. This lets you forge relationships that would otherwise be difficult to forge in an office hour environment. However, it also means you have to work with anyone that dislikes you or whom you dislike. Let's face it; we aren't saints. You will not like everyone, and the opposite will be true: not everyone will like you. 

Because have ""so much time"", *all* your courses, nonsense events and talks that you have to go will happen on your **off days**. Your IPPT will also happen on your off day. It is the only mandatory test that happens on your off day though. Most of the errands that you have to run for SCDF will also happen on your off days.

This is a little subjective, but I dislike having to work a 24 hours, because it means I gotta pack clothes and toiletries for work. It gets annoying after a few years of doing it.

---

&gt;What is the hierarchy like in a Rota?

The hierarchy in a Rota is fairly well-defined, but many Rotas end up blurring the lines due to the bond and camaraderie that is fostered over many duties of sleeping, resting, eating, working, training and getting screwed over together. Generally, the RC and DRC will be at the top working in partnership to manage the Rota. Depending on the culture, the regulars may either be their hands to enforce discipline, training, etc., or simply assist every now and then. Below them are the NSF SCs and firefighters. There usually is no distinction between NSF SCs and firefighters, other than the fact that NSF SCs have a little administrative tasks that they have to perform.

---

&gt;What happens if I'm late for work?

You do *gulungs* (malay for roll), which is the act of you taking a 64mm hose, rolling it out as the start. You then roll it in, then roll it back out. That's 1 set. The directive is you are allowed to be given a maximum of 5. People usually don't follow the directive because 5 is easy.

If you're chronically late, your superiors can charge you. 

---

&gt;I am afraid of my safety when I become a frontliner. What should I do?

You will never turn out for an incident alone. If you are ever in a situation where you are in danger or could be placed in danger (ceiling collapsing, explosions etc), you can be assured that there will be *a lot* of people on scene. The combined number of years of experience in such a situation is likely more than a hundred years. In such incidents, there will also likely be higher management commanding the situation. If you are an RC, you will have many regulars beside you who can provide guidance if you’re unsure, and support you if you make a decision.
In Singapore, frontliners like us also face fairly limited danger. We do not have huge forests that could get engulfed and surround you on all sides, and fires are actually not very common.

The construction of buildings, as well as the storage, transport and use of toxic chemicals and flammable materials are highly regulated. 

Lastly, the training protocols on SCDF have a very large focus on maintaining the safety of our own personnel. In complex operations like height rescue, we introduce many levels of redundancies to ensure that if one mechanism fails, there are backups in place. We are *never* encouraged to risk our lives to save other people. Save yourself, so you can worry about saving others.

---

&gt;How do I survive in station?

First of all, all regulars are expected to be good in operations and admin work.

If you are an RC, most of the shots fired at you will likely be other RCs or your CFS. Learn to read them and manage your time properly. Otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed by all the admin work. You will be there until you ORD or get your next posting, which is about 1 to 2 years later. It is not a very short time, so it is important to manage inter-rota relations. Don’t even think about not participating in the baris in your first few months. This is how you train up for operations. If you do not have the knowledge, and show that you are not eager to learn, *nobody* will follow your instructions. There goes your control over the Rota.

For regulars in general, the point about being expected to be good at operations is important to take note. While the NSFs can get away with meandering through, you need to be familiar with the SOPs and doctrines for different types of incidents. This is even more so if you are a section commander, because unlike the RC who will be commanding the situation, you will actually be the one overseeing the operations in close quarters. You will also sometimes be designated as the ground commander for baris. Any shortcomings in your knowledge or familiarity with the SOPs and doctrines will be extremely obvious.

The below should apply for everyone.

SCDF is not school, and it's not all flowers and happiness. It is a workplace. While it may be an unconventional environment to work in, the people here are the same. How you survive here is how you survive outside (don't be stupid, don't have more patterns than badminton, etc.), with some caveats. 

Some people may be able to survive outside by acting all tough, etc. That won't work here. You will be vulnerable in station, and people will capitalize on that if you try to act like that side of you doesn't exist. In fact, people like this will always be targeted first, and some people actually take sadistic pleasure in ensuring they break your soul (can you blame them?).

Be nice and humble, but be firm and not be a pushover. Respect your seniors and regulars. Stay humble, learn as much as you can as fast as you can, be fit (or at least show that you're trying to be fit), and be accountable and responsible.

I think this is true for all NS organizations, but I've seen a growing trend where the NSFs coming in do not know how to maintain relationships, read situations, etc. This isn't a problem specific to SCDF, but I figure I will address it here since it is still relevant. I'm not some super guru with great relationships with everyone and able to win over all my enemies, but the above should be useful.


---

&gt;I am a new personnel and I feel I am always simply following instructions. How do I become better at operations?

I disclaim this Q&amp;A by saying I’m not *fantastic* with operations, but I generally know enough to get by and make sure things go smoothly.

You do not need to be someone who is the best at operations and able to bring out 5 dummies alone in a baris, but it is important that you be proficient in all the equipment, and know when to use them. Quick thinking is also important, but this may not be natural for everyone. It will, however, come in time. 

I have narrowed down 6 aspects that I think contributes to success at operations:

* Presence of mind while under pressure and when fatigued

* Strength

* Endurance

* Technique and knowledge

* Command, leadership and spatial visualization

* Communication

Presence of mind refers to one’s ability to keep calm and make decisions. It is important because you will be expected to make decisions. For RCs, you will be commanding your entire Rota to achieve an overall objective (mitigate the CA? Put out the fire? Rescue the trapped casualty?). Even if you are a section commander receiving instructions from your RC over the matra, you may still need to make decisions. How do you want this particular door to be cut? Will a bolt cutter suffice for this lock? Do you want to delegate one of your crew members to a separate task? What task needs to be done that the RC has not tasked someone to do yet?

Strength should be self-explanatory. Many equipment in SCDF are heavy. Our lifepack, for example, weighs more than 100kg and requires multiple personnel to deploy properly. You need to be able to extricate an unconscious casualty, who may weigh up to 90kg or more. On the lower end of the spectrum, you will be expected to carry one medium-sized hose and one other equipment while you’re in full gear. That comes out to around 30kg to 40kg. Certain stations may expect more from you. 

Having said that, strength is not the be all, end all. It is good to have, but without the other factors, your strength will not come out to be of much use. 

Endurance is the most important factor of them all. SCDF operations aren’t as prolonged as the army’s (which may last days or weeks), but due to the fast and furious nature of SCDF frontlines, personnel get tired out very easily. Endurance will make sure you can continue functioning 45 minutes into the operation.

Technique and knowledge are also important. Without our equipment, we are useless. Knowing when to use and how to use the equipment will make a big difference.

Command and leadership is important. Most people will be able to take charge when asked to, but everybody does it to different levels of effectiveness, which is determined by your decisiveness, familiarity with the incident (which we achieve through continual training) and your visualization skills. Visualization is important because it allows you to keep in view what each section is doing and their exact locations. Every baris or large-scale operation will have a staging point, which serves as the heart of the operations. Ask them for information, because it is with these information that you can make the appropriate decisions.

Communication refers specifically to the act of using matra to relay information between the following parties:

* staging point
* ground commander
* Ops Center
* individual section commanders on the ground

Communication and visualization work hand-in-hand. If there's radio silence during a baris or operations, no one will know what each other is doing, leading to a lot of redundant tasks and erroneous prioritization of tasks (secondary search on other storeys while there's somebody burning and dying in a fire).

Every factor interacts with each other, so it is difficult for me to segregate everything out. Hopefully with the above wall of text, I have presented the concept clearly enough for it to be of use. If it didn’t, I summarize it with this sentence: training and practice helps.

For NSFs, just be proficient in your equipment, be sharp with your technique, and listen to your seniors, regulars and RC.

---

&gt;What type of admin work is there?

* Logistics

* Manpower (including management of regular leaves)

* NSF management (including management of NSF leaves)

* Enforcement (scheduling fire safety checks and processing the cases)

* HRI planning

* Operational survey (conducting of surveys at companies for familiarization of premises, and updating records)

* Hydrant testing (performing hydrant tests and updating the system)

* Community engagement

* Projects

---

&gt;What do the yearly audits involve?

Every year, audits will be done on all units, including NSTI and CDA (although I have heard that HQ itself only gets audited once every few years). The audits are based on KPIs that ensure multiple aspects of the Force are smooth-running: our public image, our efficiency, our efficacy and our administrative management. Generally, stations will be audited on the following:

- Operational readiness (e.g are all protective gears and equipment in good condition?)
- Equipment operation
- Equipment theoretical knowledge (i.e specifications like weight, dimensions, uses, etc.)
- Fire safety of the station (e.g extinguishers and hosereels serviced, exit lights illuminated, etc.)
- Public image (outlook of the station, its fireposts and vehicles)
- Security (through red teaming, which is basically an undercover officer who will test the sentry personnel's alertness at any time)
- Technological security (whether the security of the computers has been compromised, such as through unauthorized usage of USB devices)

Most appointments are auditable, with their own section in the audit checklist. Examples will include:

- Under Manpower and NSF Leave Management: Was proper leave application done as per the leave management directive laid out by Manpower? Are all leaves documented properly? Are there any unconsumed leaves that have expired?
- Under Enforcement: Were all cases followed up within 2 weeks?
- Under Operational Survey: Are all records updated properly?
- Under CERT Audit: Are all audits documented properly?
- Under Public Affairs: Are all Public Spiritness Award nominations (nominations for members of public who assist in operations) done within the KPI?

Certain appointments, such as leave management, traditionally require an IC in each Rota, and are headed by the appropriate Rota, whereas others, such as anything relating to public affairs, would only be taken by one Rota.

Any issues in such aspects will count against the station, and at the end units will be given a final score and ranked according to their scores. 

---

&gt;Is it advisable to take part-time studies while working on a 24-48 shift?

I initially hesitated on tackling this question, but since this is a very unique set of circumstances, I thought I’d try to address this.

I don’t have any advice on how to manage your time, because I intend to study full-time after my bond, so this will just be a very short factual paragraph.

If you do decide to take it on, and your classes fall on your duty day, you can take time off for it. SCDF is very supportive of continual education. You can also study while on duty (but obviously it will be disruptive).

---

&gt;Is the Rota shift tiring?

It is chicken feet compared to the SPF NPCO and EMS shift. Unless you get a call in the middle of the night, you should be able to get at least 4-6 hours of rest. NSFs have it worse because they have to man the sentry. If you get lesser than that, you have your first off day to get some more rest in.

I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to get used to the 24 hours, but it’s really very similar to other jobs, except you just spend your night in a fire station. The two days off are also good because it’s uninterrupted downtime. 

---

&gt;Do you have to work on your off days?

Sometimes, yes. You get sent to attend some stupid event where it is very obvious you’re there just to bolster the numbers. Other times it’s a 2 day course on both your off days, so you get no rest at all. This is what I hate by far **the most**. I can do whatever you want on my duty, just don’t ask me to attend events that I don’t care about. 
If you have a lot of admin work to catch up, you do it on your off days too.

---

&gt;I would like to be a firefighter but I wear spectacles. Can I still proceed?

Yes. The Force will issue you goggles with degree lenses that will allow you to wear your facemask over it.

---

&gt;Is there ragging in SCDF?

~~No.~~

~~Ragging as it is traditionally understood does not exist anymore (and if it does, the people doing it are taking an extremely big risk, and also doing a good job at hiding it). SCDF takes an extremely firm stance on the matter, and anybody found taking part in ragging will be sent to DB, be given a warning letter (an extremely huge deal, as it is considered a formal disciplinary action and will affect your performance grading and other monetary incentives), or directly forced to resign.~~

~~There may be playful nudging here and there for the newer guys, and some people may be more stern to them to keep them in place and to make sure they learn what they need to quickly (see “How do I survive in station?""). They may be expected to do repeated fatiguing activities, like BTMs, but this is all in the name of learning and practice. I encountered the same thing and I didn’t like it, but this remains a very good way to identify big-headed and/or undertrained personnel.~~

Yes. Report it if you are the victim of **serious** incidents. Once the investigation settles down, the perpetrators will not be around anyway, between DB and being forced to resign.

---

&gt;What will be my career progression like?

Non-diploma holders start as CPL+ but wear the SGT rank. The official records show that they are CPL. Their first promotion will be to full SGT. Their pay will be slightly lesser than full SGTs. Diploma holders start as full SGT. 

Degree holders start out as either LTA or CPT, depending on their academic achievements and whether they are considered to have the aptitude to start their career as a CPT. It is to my knowledge that first-class honours graduates are no longer automatically conferred the CPT rank.

Regulars who sign on before NS (henceforth referred to as pre-enlistees) will be bonded for 5 years (see “MTE”).  Their starting rank will follow the rules as set out in the previous paragraph. Their first promotion will usually (but not always, as in cases where the regular is extremely good at his job) be delayed by 1 or 2 years compared to regulars who have served NS. 

Your primary appointment of firefighting and rescue actually has little bearing on your promotions (although specialist tracks, especially DART, do help). Most of the recognition will be due to high-level project, especially those with a large amount of tangible, trackable benefits with little to no drawbacks. 

3-5 years in service, you can opt to specialize into an aspect: Hazmat, DART, Firebiker, EMT or Marine. Hazmat in particular is a very useful and sought-after specialist certification if you ever wish to leave the force. You are also forced to specialize sometimes. It is also not unheard of to be able to specialize before 3 years of service.
Depending on vacancies, you may be posted to the specialist unit, or you may return back to your fire station to wait for a vacancy. The time you have to wait is variable.

Further postings after that also depend on many variables. One thing to note is that at any time if you are injured beyond frontline operational capabilities, you may be posted to the backend as admin staff instead.
Personnel who are generally getting on in age also tend to be posted towards the backend, especially if they have also expressed a preference for such postings.

---

&gt;How likely will I get my preferred posting?

Manpower and NSPD (National Service Personnel Department) will take into account preference, proximity and manpower needs when they make postings. However, don't count on being able to get your first choice. At least a third of my Rota could have been posted to a way better station.

---

&gt;I am an active section commander. How do I be better at comms?

If you seize up when using the comms, you just need to practice more. 

If you’re not sure what information needs to be relayed and what doesn’t, observe what other section commanders do.

Your informative message must be given within 1-2 minutes upon arrival. I originally wanted to list down what information is required, but there are too many types of situations and variables to take into account. As a general rule of thumb, your informative message should contain what you would want to know if you’re a blind rescuer except information that allows you to move around. In other words, you will want to report the following:

* Your location

* Any casualties found

* What equipment is being used

* Nature of fire (what type of fire? How big is the fire? Are there any chemicals? Is it contained?)

* Nature of rescue (Is somebody trapped? Is the situation stable? Is SCDF stabilizing the incident?)

While the incident is ongoing, the frequency of comms is determined by whether it is an actual operation or just a baris. If it is a baris, report whatever you’re doing so that they can update you and so the ground commander knows your location. Baris tend to be more complex with more injections, so comms is more important than usual.
If it is a real operation, just improvise and play by ear. With experience, you will know what is relevant and what isn’t.

Don’t be too hung up on the proper format for comms. As long as it doesn’t sound too casual, you will be good. Be familiar with common NATO phonetic alphabets. Last thing you want to do is use it, then blank out as you forget the word for the letter “N”.",toothyfalcon,friend suicide

I am currently one year in army and have cases in the past contemplating suicide during secondary school. Of course I found something in life and things became better.

Fast forward. I have been in the army for a year and never once did I enjoy my time here other than enjoy doing everything with your friends. I'm combat fit and there's been ups and down in army, I have a hell time of a unit induction program and that being what I consider the worse experience in my life but that did not trigger my depression and anxiety nor anything. It was fun.

The only thing keeping me sane is being able complain to my friends but the same response suck thumb would come in. Recently I have been getting mood swings but not because of pressure in army, training has been considered very lax for me. 

I feel like a caged bird and honestly ,I'm sure everyone felt the same but they have been taking it with a suck thumb mentality. It is depressing seeing how easily people give up to power because they don't have a choice. It depresses me that I am unable to grasp the point of sucking thumb and finish this two years. 11 more months to go, wow! And they say time passes fast. Its depressing for someone to have power over you, you do not have a choice. Pity the north koreans under oppression

I'm getting anxiety feeling trapped and I hide it from people. They say I looked depressed but what can I tell them? I feel muscles tensing every moment knowing I'm trapped. I hate that knowing I have another 11 months of being in a bunk, being trapped in the same camp. The same old view. The same damn cook house. Marching pass same tree you see every damn day. 

My friends, my girlfriend tells me, it will pass. NO it doesn't work this way. Don't tell me it will pass, it is still going on. Don't tell me things will be over, its still not. Not yet. 

I understand the importance of deterrence. But this place isn't for me.... Please tell me what to do, its eating me everyday. Getting a pes F and hearing stories of people unable to lead a proper life has stopped me from checking up for depression but I'm tired... Please advice...

I am currently 15, 16 this year. A bit of backstory of myself, I have anxiety and depression ever since I was 12. At 12 years old, I've contemplated suicide and even attempted it but was stopped by a passer-by calling the ambulance. Ever since then, suicidal thoughts haven't really came into my mind since I've found a passion for online games and made lots of friends with it, until now. When I was 14 i stopped going to school because of bad experiences, and my anxiety got even worse. My parents also divorced during that time making it hell for me. Right now i've been posted to another secondary school and thankfully they are giving me another chance to start over, however, I just can't bring myself to go. Just the thought of going to school makes it hard to breathe. I can't sleep through the night, waking up 2 hours after I sleep. Thinking about school makes me want to go crazy, I sweat, and just go into a panic attack. I've went to NUH for counselling the past 2 years but it isn't really helping much as well. I'm really thankful for my parents at helping me to start anew but I just can't do it. I feel ashamed and disappointed at myself, but I don't want to let them down..

I was walking back to pay the food court guy then got this old man saying ""please help me please help me in mandarin"" everyone ignore him, I went up to help. At first when he said he need coffee I was hesitant but anyway I told him to stay still and I went to buy coffee for him. After buying coffee he seemed to be walking around again, I got hi
m his coffe and he said he needed to go to the interchange, while bringing him to the interchange I got to know more about him.

I asked him what he was doing out alone, he said that there was nobody to help him, and when he was outside nobody would listen to his plea for help. He said I sounded young and that only young boys would help him. Never an adult helped him. He partially blind at 11 yrs old, now he's fully blind. Parents are deceased , brothers and sisters left him. He constantly thinks about suiciding, he cries whenever he think of his parents.

I told him to slow down when he eat but he said he didn't eat since the afternoon. Confirm garunteed plus chop he not lying. A burning packet of coffee drank in like 10 seconds.

After eating in the toilet I brought him to bus 854 , and then bought him another packet of coffee. He said cannot bring on bus later spill, by then I was already devastated.

"Help me, I have been sexually harassed by my neighbours for three years",1292,949bo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/949bo1/help_me_i_have_been_sexually_harassed_by_my/,261,2018-08-04 04:52:19,"I spent the last three years being harassed, having my modesty outraged by my neighbours and getting ignored by the authorities. Here’s my story.


For years, my neighbours have been provoking my family and me. My mother, a frail hawker who has to wake up at 4:30am for work, has been greatly disturbed by the noise pollution created by them. Kids running around, teenagers singing loudly. My younger brother was once afraid of taking the lift because the boys threw their football at him.


Little did I know the rowdy boys were just a prelude to an avalanche of problems. As they grew up to become teenagers with raging hormones, they started catcalling me. They hauled me derogatory names whenever I entered or exited the lift. They dared each other to look under my skirt, speaking in Malay, thinking that we do not understand the language.


It is a common occurrence. Every day since the first incident three years ago, I enter my lift in a befuddled state and prepare for the impending deluge of verbal abuse. The surge of fear that rises up my throat as the lift approaches my floor is an everyday occurrence.


If they are not hanging around the lift lobby when I walk out, I wonder when will I bump into them again. Possibly the next day. If they are present, I hurry from the lift lobby to my house, hanging my head in shame and avoiding any eye contact. What am I ashamed of? That I’m a girl, therefore, I deserve to be harassed? I grew afraid of going out or returning home because that meant volunteering to be abused.


I trudged past them again last night, with a look of continual defeat. The verbal abuse and sniggers continued. They knew that I've about given up all hopes. It finally dawned upon me that my house is no longer a home I can happily return to.


I've had enough of being irascible and irritable by the time I make it to my gates. I detest the fact that the excitement of seeing my mother after a long day has been replaced with me growing increasingly frustrated at her, as if she landed me at my predicament because she picked this estate.


I’m sorry, mommy. I now realise that my mother does not have it easier either. She never experienced uninterrupted rest since the day my neighbours started harassing us. If she's not worried about them harassing me, her sleep is disturbed by the mob of kids that insist on playing at my corridor dead at night.


If you are a parent, I am sure you know how helpless my mother felt. That her own daughter was getting bullied in a way that is illegal in some European countries yet the town council and policemen would not step in to help. That she, as a hawker, has no means of getting us out of this estate until either I or my brother gets married.


Even my friends who visited are horrified by the image presented to them. My girl friends get harassed as well. No one can bring themselves to believe that this part of Singapore — a fully developed country — exists.


We threatened them with law enforcement and for a while, they stopped. But when they realised it was all but empty threats, they started again. So we stuck to our words and called the town council. After my first call, they promised to look into it and I was given a number to call lest they create a disturbance again. Nobody picked up the phone when we called in.


The same happened when we contacted the police through the non-emergency number, who said they will be coming in 10-20 minutes to investigate the matter but nobody turned up. Now I see that even civil servants are unwilling to help us.


I only saw a glimmer of hope when I contacted the People's Association of my area. We set up a meeting during which, they assured me that my MP was concerned. They reassured me that they will be conducting routine checks. Let’s be real here, the noise pollution and harassment happen after office hours. Who would sacrifice their family time to deal with this issue? Still, I placed my trust in them.


They emphasised that I should lie low while they liaised with the town council and police station. Well, it’s been one year since, and the situation has not changed. Not even one bit.


I turned to other options. I compiled a video of the times their siblings/cousins/friends disturbed our neighbours to send to my MP for his perusal. (I’ve lurked on reddit for about seven years now but I’m pretty new to posting stuff so I’m unsure how can I embed it here. The video’s on my Facebook account, accessible at fb /pekyj. Please let me know if linking this way isn’t allowed — I can remove this part immediately)


The video shows just a few, and the least severe, instances I managed to capture with my phone — all the catcalling incidences went unrecorded because I do not feel safe taking a video with their piercing stares on me. The video is a shortened, censored version. I censored their faces before posting because these kids, while disruptive, were not the source of my torment.


The video was shown only to prove a point: that there was an issue of disturbance and overcrowding. Before you ask, yes, the video clips were taken well after 10pm.


The last straw was a distasteful reply I received from my MP(’s PA, I assume), dripping with sarcasm.


It reads:
""You can consider a variety of different possible Court orders if you are of the view that there has been nuisance or harassment or that your neighbours are denying you quiet enjoyment. Since the Town Council or the Police is not an option which you wish to consider, and if you wish to consider your legal options, you can consider consulting with the Law Society for recommendations.""
I refuse to even reply to that atrocious email. Consider my legal options? If I had the money, I would not be living in a rented two-room flat. I do not understand how they can’t see that it is not about the peace, but my safety. Why should I feel unsafe in my own neighbourhood? What happened to Singapore being the safest country in 2018?


I could shout something back and pray that it will stop the abuse, but should I take the chance? I am a petite girl — just a little beyond 150cm — and they are a group of guys. Sometimes up to 10 in a group. Forget about whether it’s legal or not to have that many people living in the same house, what are my defences if they were to gang up on me? If I take up self-defence classes, what are my chances of winning a fight? I don't know, and I'm afraid to ever find out.


I have reached a dead end. I am done. I do not have the intention of intimidating anyone but I have had enough of being ignored. I am sick of being objectified, I am exhausted, I feel vulnerable in my home — my supposed safe haven. I just want to feel safe in my neighbourhood. I want to be happy about returning home to my family. Just once. I sincerely hope it is not too much to ask for.


I want to emphasise that this is not about race — the last thing I want to read are racist remarks. Don’t make this about any race. I just want to know if there are any other options can I consider. If you connections or solutions, please let me know.


This is a real cry for help, it is truly my last resort. The more shares I get, the higher my chances of it reaching someone who might be able to help, and maybe relevant authorities will start paying attention to my case.


Please, I’m begging you, please share this. It’s been three torturous years, and who knows how many mor",pekyj,I feel irritable

I'm currently doing my last year in poly. I'm a year 4, but gonna graduate soon by August. I'm in Diploma in IT, which I regret taking up.(edit)

I have been doing my research on signing on to the SPF, but I have plenty of questions to ask. I feel that the info that I got is not convincing enough for me to sign on.

Plus, the enlistment letter I got this year is for CD. Most of my close friends who are in CD say it's best for a person like me not to go in CD. They have many reasons for that, but most of them says there are things happening inside there like, drug abuse and stuff like that? I don't really believe them, but maybe they could be right.(Edited)

I also went for the SPF Insight on 25th April. Most officers I spoke to, I feel they were telling half-truths. The SPF Insight also didn't reveal much on vocations, leaving me with many questions.

Some thread that I have been reading on HWZ: http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/national-service-knowledge-base-162/signing-spf-so-po-scheme-5037646.html

Reasons I want to sign on: 

1. I don't see myself taking up IT as a career at any point in my life(edited). I should've taken up Diploma in Events Management instead, should've continued what I studied in ITE. Thus the Diploma in IT is like redundant, just using as a paper to get a better pay.

2.I wanna sign on is because of the 30K lump sum and(hopefully) also the sponsorship for degree after 2-5 years in service as PO. Sponsorship is not easy to get as confirmed in the thread above and also at SPF Insight.

3. I feel that I would suit better as a PO. Have been combing through CD and SPF website, and I'm leaning more towards a career as a PO. 

My questions would be: 

1. Preferably which vocation should I sign on to?  I don't want to spend 100% of my time once I've signed on(Edited) . I'm thinking of going SOC but after seeing how skinny SOC officers/sergeants are at the insight, I'm like 50/50. Seems to be like they are overtrained. 

2. SPF and CD, what are the major differences between these 2 if you sign on?

3. I welcome any life advise. I really feel like shit, as if I hit rock-bottom.

* They spent **more** than they officially received in 2015-16, though that could be down to the move from Singpost Centre to their current location. Indeed, looking at their local expenses, there is one massive SPIKE in that year, comparing to 2014-15 and 2016-17.

* They earned $11 mil in 2016-17 with *barely ANY expenses*, only 500k-ish or so. Whatever happened to the rest of the 11 mil, I dunno.

* They've also got $15 mil in assets in 2016-17 and paid $3 mil to employees that year too. I'm no expert in looking into funds, so somebody help out here.

* Overall, not *as bad* as I expected, but those numbers in 2016-17 raises serious questions, in my personal opinion.

Hey guys. This might not be the best place to post it, but since I posted the original post here, and I want to get the word out, I think here is the only right place to post it. Apologies to the mods in advance if this isn't the right thing to do.

But yeah. Remember my post a few months ago about Heart of God Church, where I *kinda sorta* posted a long-ish report on why they may be commercializing Christianity? (*scam is a bit too strong a term, but it was in the title, so couldn't do shit about editing that*)

Welll....[it got taken down via DMCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8lrm5u/long_post_why_i_think_heart_of_god_church_may_be/).

And, no, [I'm not shitting with you.](https://imgur.com/HEnT0EQ)

And the thing is, I **think** I know why it got taken down. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm confident I know why. And who.

*****

About two weeks ago (*or so*), I received a message from a user called /u/ChegevaRRa asking me to delete said post. I refuse, citing rather obvious reasons. I ask him why, he says he's from Russia and can understand my situation with HOGC. I still say no. And this is where it all gets fucking weird.

Good old /u/ChegevaRRa says he's **IN CONTACT** with several news agencies like The Times and BBC, and says he wants to get the story out. From deleting my message to getting my story out in the blink of an eye, I can tell /u/ChegevaRRa is *clearly bullshitting*. But hey, I do the James Veitch role in playing along. Heck, who knows if /u/ChegevaRRa might be legit. However, he kept insisting, that, for ""**copyright reasons**"", I had to delete my post for BBC to report on it.

I go even so far as to give him a *burner email* for him to contact me, just to see how far he would take it. [He sent me this](https://imgur.com/lFca853), which is probably the saddest attempt at impersonating somebody from the BBC I've ever seen (*and that includes B.B. See*). I mean, dude, a **YAHOO account??**.

About this time, I kinda give up. I actually admired /u/ChegevaRRa's attempt to scam me to delete my post, I honestly did. I told him I saw thru his attempt. Heck, I even *gave him tips* on how to scam slightly better, cause why not? He still insisted it was legit, but I didn't pay attention to all that shit.

Cut to three days ago, [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9oooq5/about_my_article/) gets posted on /r/ModSupport. Someone attempting to **impersonate me**, saying that I wanted to *delete my post*. Fake me goes on to say that the media wanted to use my story and so wants to ask the mods how to *delete my post* in order to give it to the Sun.

I have every right to think this impersonator is /u/ChegevaRRa, given how  the ""British Newspaper wants to claim copyright over my post"" excuse to delete it is brought up once again. Heck, his impersonation of me was *even worse* than his impersonation of a reporter from the BBC. Thankfully, the mods of /r/singapore saw through this and banned fake me. Good on ya, mods.

Which leads to **now**.

*****

My post on Heart of God Church got taken down. Due to '*copyright*'. That post was something **I FUCKING WROTE.** Using *my own pictures* and *my own experiences*. I posted all my sources in the comments wherever I got my own screengrabs. If I ever *did* copy anything, it's a criticism/report of the going-ons behind HOGC and I'm **not earning any money** over a self-post on Reddit. 

And I think good ol' /u/ChegevaRRa is behind this shit. Given his attempts over the last two weeks, I have every reason to think so. Might not 100% be him, because reddit didn't disclose who sent the DMCA takedown, but I'm highly confident its him. Or her. Or it, if a monkey is behind all this. Actually, it might be a monkey. Only monkeys could impersonate a member of the BBC *that badly*.

I'll try to send a counter-notice, which seems difficult given how I could only send it via snail mail, but whatever. I'm posting this here, now, just to let y'all know **why** it got taken down. 

I still hold this stance against HOGC, though I haven't been back there since April. Once again, I feel churches and religious organizations are *sorta okay* as long as they **DON'T COMMERCIALIZE THEIR SHIT** or **promote discrimination**. Makes it difficult for me, as the Catholic Church recently asked to keep 377A, which as a Catholic that supports the repeal, puts me in a bit of a sitch. yeah.

Also, [here's a full imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/D0tJijy) of my convo with ChegevaRRa. You might say I'm a bit too kind in my convo, but I'm like that naturally. Whoever ChegevaRRa is and no matter how much I hate him for attempting to delete my post (and possibly sending the DMCA), **he's still a human**. WHATEVER YOU DO, **DON'T** DOX HIM.

And finally, the HOGC post. It's gone from reddit, but I still have the original thing. I posted a few edits on the OP that are gone now, but I still have the big bulk of it. I couldn't find any *appropriate* place to post it on reddit, for fear of takedown, but no fear. I've posted it to my saviour, **PasteBin**. Don't worry, I posted this on pastebin myself. Though plaintext, it has all the image + their sources I used.

&#x200B;

School has only made my life worse. I was bullied from P5 to P6 by my classmates. I was ostracised and discriminated for my views opinions. I has a crush back then and she meant everything to me - cute laugh, alluring voice and a smile that would brighten my days. The day I confessed to her (through a letter) was the day of my downfall. She never talked to me since and that letter got passed around to everyone and all my classmates had their own little joke about how ""creepy"" I was. The only time I was honest and expressed my true feelings for someone, I became a laughing stock. I was shattered inside as people teased and made fun of me over and over and over again, every single day.

&#x200B;

I became a punching bag. People saw that I was weakened from the mental damage I sustained and proceeded to take advantage of me - both physically and verbally abusing me.

""Come come guys lets move out of the way for Damster to stare at her again.""

&#x200B;

""Your drawings are shit.""

&#x200B;

""Ya la ya la you're so smart right? Go away lah, smart kid!""

&#x200B;

I still remember that time when my classmates made fun of me in public. I still remember that time when my classmates shamed me for coming from a ""poor"" family. I still remember that time when one of my classmates purposefully held my crush's hand just to make me feel jealous. Life back then was like a movie without a climax - absolutely miserable. I felt oppressed and worthless.

&#x200B;

Barely anyone talked to me for the two whole years of hell and sometimes I felt like I was going insane when sitting in a corner doodling. Doodling as I watched all the cliques having so much fun. I was so lonely that I would cuddle with a stuffed toy, pretending that its a loved one, and crying myself to sleep day after day. I still do :')

&#x200B;

I lost my social skills and developed a speech impediment. I couldn't talk properly, I stuttered when asking questions. It got so bad to the point where I became terrifyed of ordering food and would go out of my way to avoid it. I grew thinner and thinner. I felt so tired that I didn't want to do anything at all.

&#x200B;

What were the teachers doing when all of this was happening?

&#x200B;

""Again and again I'm telling you, just ignore them!""

&#x200B;

Fuck you, piece of shit. What an interesting way of saying ""I'm too lazy and incompetent to help you."".

&#x200B;

I felt so hopeless as even the teachers aren't willing to help me. I felt like a prisoner in my own body and I was going mad.

&#x200B;

At least I had gotten a 251 for PSLE. ""Your exam results is all that matters!"" Eat my ass, dad. Have fun with your mentally handicaped child.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to secondary school. Got into one of the schools with a high cut-off point. IP programme. SAP school. Shouldn't be too bad, right?

&#x200B;

The classmates there are fine, but now its the teachers that are torturing me.

&#x200B;

They don't teach us, they threaten us.

&#x200B;

""Stop doodling or I'll give you a demerit point!"" What kind of fucking education is this? What am I supposed to learn from this? I get that it's wrong to doodle in class as it's a sign of disrespect for the speaker, but what if some students don't get the idea? They won't learn anything from it.

&#x200B;

""You did something wrong. Write me a reflection letter and if I don't like it, you will re-write it."" Okay... now what the fuck's the point of a reflection letter when its contents has to revolve around what you personally enjoy reading and not my actual thoughts about the given situation? You just want control over your students, don't you?

&#x200B;

There's no freedom of speech. Here's an experience I had:

&#x200B;

PREVIOUSLY

&#x200B;

Me: \*Route A to my math class was blocked. Have to use route B.\*

&#x200B;

Me: \*Arrives at class late.\*

&#x200B;

2 DAYS LATER

&#x200B;

Me: \*Route A AND B to my math class was blocked. Had to find and use route C.\*

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""Why were you late?""

&#x200B;

Me: ""Oh, the route was blocked so I had to find another.""

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""This isn't the first time the route was blocked off. That is not a valid excuse.""

&#x200B;

Me: ""However, this time both routes that I have been using for the past two terms have been blocked, not to mention that this is the first time that so many routes have been blocked before. Basically, I didn't know of route C and has to spend extra time finding it.""

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""Okay, go stand at the back of the class as punishment for being late.""

&#x200B;

????????????

&#x200B;

WHAT? This teacher punishes people for things that they are not in control of, and also punishes people for not knowing information that wasn't even disclosed in the first place. No empathy. Not a human.

&#x200B;

He also doesn't take his students' words into account, what's the point of even reasoning with him? He is the kind of teacher that makes students feel worthless because in his eyes, everything a student does is wrong and he gets to decide whether to accept certain things said by students based on his personal feelings and mood.

&#x200B;

It's like criticising a historian for not knowing how to do algebra. It's fucking irrelevant.

&#x200B;

More, more more bullshit in my school!

&#x200B;

(This one happened to one of my classmates.) ""You didn't complete the assignment I gave you? Then I shall give you even more homework as punishment!"" Fucking what??? The above student is already struggling with that given topic and is trying to catch up with the rest of the class, and yet he is weighed down even more academically because of this? It's not really a punishment anymore when the impact of it can be detrimental to the receiver - that student's academic progress may have actually been slowed down because of this extra homework (Homework on topics that he has already learnt.) which may, as a result, fuck up his final exam grade due to the fact that he may not have time to catch up with all the topics? What shallow thinking from the teachers...

&#x200B;

There was once I walked into an unauthorised examination area. Yes, it was wrong of me but the way I got treated afterwards is just.... ???????

&#x200B;

""Stupid! Look at these no-brainers! Do you even know who is allowed to enter those areas? \*Takes out phone\* Going to snap a photo of you two idiots and SHAME you!""

Although she did (Very very briefly.) explain to me why I shoudn't be there, she spent half the session verbally attacking me. How is this allowed? It suggests that my school supports the idea of using personal attacks, insults and manipulating students' emotions (Using fear.) as a form of education.

&#x200B;

This one happened just two days ago:

&#x200B;

The teacher told us to take out our study materials to revise for the upcoming tests. I naturally study better at the comfort of my home so I decided that I wouldn't revise and would instead, help out my fellow classmate which is struggling in a subject that I happen to know quite a bit about.

&#x200B;

""Helping her to revise? Don't bullshit me! You always try to be different and it makes me very irritated. Do you really think you have the choice to do what you want? Stop making the teachers pissed off, I'm telling you.""

&#x200B;

Apparently helping others is prohibited now? This makes me think that my school believes that competition is more valuable than cooperation. This suggests that my school supports selfishness and self-centeredness. I feel so helpless in this school, its like everything I do is wrong :( Every time I try to improve myself, the school raises the bar higher and finds even more things to criticise me about. This may work for some students but it genuinely kills me inside. It's honestly really fucking scary to see yourself getting weaker and more exhausted with every day that passes. The pain is immeasurable and I want to scream.

&#x200B;

And what the fuck was that about? What's wrong with being different? Oi, we are humans leh. We all have our views and perspectives and you, piece of shit, should learn to respect that shoudn't you? How the fuck are you able to know so much about me to be able to evaluate what's good and what's bad for me so confidently when you barely even know me? Go become a fortune teller lah.

&#x200B;

Not to mention that it's his personal choice to get ""pissed off"" about this. He is pushing his personal thoughts and opinions onto me, trying to use them to gain control over his students?

&#x200B;

\^\^This is the same teacher that separates me from all my friends for ""being a bad influence"".

&#x200B;

Why am I even responsible fo influencing others? Ever heard of victim-blaming in rape? Here's a scenario:

&#x200B;

A woman dresses in a way that exposes lots of skin; a man finds her attractive and rapes her. In court, the woman is sentenced to jail because she was the one that caused the man to rape her.

&#x200B;

\^\^Obviously, this is immoral and wrong, right? Becaue it's the man's choice whether to rape her or not and he has full control over whether to do it or not.

&#x200B;

AND, just like how its 100% the man's choice whether to rape her or not, it is 100% my classmates' choice whether to get influenced by me or not. Why am I being blamed?

&#x200B;

Okay la I know some of the things I've said about teachers and the education system is pretty bullshitt-y, but I just want to vent out my feelings. The purpose of this rant is to seek comfort from fellow Sinagporeans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could just seek a school transfer, but what's holding me back? My speaking problems. It gets so bad that I can't even say my name properly (Which is going to give my new school a pretty shitty impression of me.) so I'll just have to stay in my current school.  


It's a vicious cycle ;)

[Serious rant] Why are we not more supportive of the Google Singapore staff who staged a walkout/in?,0,9tshrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9tshrg/serious_rant_why_are_we_not_more_supportive_of/,33,2018-11-04 00:19:41,"I think we can all agree that Singaporeans are generally apathetic and indifferent. Maybe it's a result of the political/social culture which actively discourages advocacy, activism, etc. which paints activists and advocates for various causes in a negative light. Maybe it's ""Asian values"" that we should keep a low profile and not ""stir shit"". I don't know.

But even if you disagree with the cause, why are we not more supportive of the fact that there are people who are willing to fight for what they believe in? Why are we so cynical and eager to paint them with the broad brush of ""SJWism""? I think it's admirable, and healthy even, that they feel strongly enough about a cause to do something about it, beyond bitching about it on Facebook/Twitter/Reddit.

And I think it's something that everyone should strive towards. We may not agree on a cause, but do we really want to be the kind of society that sits back and do nothing about our grievances except post online? Do we really have that collective ironclad faith in the competency and infallibility of our political leaders, to give them unchecked power to do what they want?

I know this comes off as a rant, and that's because it partly is. But I sincerely feel that the direction of politics in Singapore is heading towards dangerous territory. When government officials (allegedly) remove newspaper editors because they don't like what was published; when there are (arguably) politically-charged lawsuits against opposition leaders; when one party has the power to amend the constitution as they wish without real opposition... this is not healthy for the development and progress of a country, both politically and socially.

I just feel that a healthy democracy requires citizens who are vocal and passionate about what they believe in. I don't mean protests and riots on the streets, or the ugly polarization in the US. But a peaceful walkout/in is a great start, and I'm just disappointed that there are so many people who are immediately cynical/dismissive of ",avocado_milkshake,I feel like shit

I'm currently serving NS as an ASA, and I like the job. But recently, about a week ago, for no apparent reason, I started feeling rather under the weather a lot. I don't really know how to describe it. Its kind of like a "" no motivation to do anything "" kind of feeling... It really makes me feel very lousy. I don't think its depression, mainly because I still feel happy during work. I still laugh with my friends and talk shit with them, only thing is afterwards that feeling of dread comes back in. I still enjoy my games at the end of the day and coming back to my bed. But its just that this feeling keeps nagging me. I can be happy but at the same time sad...And it really makes me exhausted sometimes. I think I might have an idea of what started it but I highly doubt it.

I don’t know shit about Singapore. But I feel in the Western World, this would seem like a slap on the wrist. 

Just wondering. If anyone can help explain it. I have some theories such as: 

- 15 year olds don’t look that different from a 20 year old 
- showing an obscene video to a child while fucked up isn’t exactly physically damaging in anyway besides possibly mentally which is hard to prove or no how the child will be affected 
- possessing child porn while also fucked up you aren’t “directly” harming anyone cause it already happened. You’re just consuming it now. 

If the two 15 year olds were 20, would this guy get an even more lenient sentence if any? Would it be harder for a legal adult to get a rape sentence without any overt violence like beating, kidnapping, drugging hostage situation. 

Because what I gather is that these two women’s agreed to meet him. One even wore a school girl outfit and no panties exactly as he wanted. So there’s a bit of “they kind of didn’t say no. They knew at least in some form what they were getting themselves into” but they’re still minors so it’s also his responsibility not to corrupt them.

Anyone has a/have crazy neighbour(s)?,22,8tqx8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8tqx8y/anyone_has_ahave_crazy_neighbours/,35,2018-06-26 06:26:20,"Anyone has any crazy neighbour stories? Well I got one. 

Been living in Singapore for 18 years. 21 this year. It wasn’t until 2008 that I moved to HDB from a rented condo. From HDB to condo there isn’t really much of a difference apart from facilities, but i got comfortable quickly. 

Living in HDB area, there’s this particular chinese family that’s across my block. I knew their existence for the first time back in 2008 when I saw her family fight with their indian neighbour. Since it was long ago and I was young, I can’t remember why or what they were fighting about. Something about commotion or whatever. I was going Bintan that afternoon, what do i care. 

After that incident, the lady from that family became very apparent. She would make a lot of noise, shout loud enough for the neighbourhood to hear she’s there, and I think the indian neighbour they were fighting with moved out after a while. That’s where things started getting worse. 

If I’m not wrong, I hear their lady’s “son” (i think) shout a lot and seem to be in an argument, so did the lady’s “husband”, and these arguments happen late at night, with doors banging and all that. I think it’s with the lady. She kept going at her noise making routine which is pretty often. After a while, I never hear or see the “husband” or “son” in the house any more, or around. Just her. 

Think this was when she really meets insanity. She now just scolds everybody and anybody she sees in the neighbourhood. CCB, KNN, F word, all that shit you name and she definitely has said those over the decade. Heck, she scolds kids downstairs playing when they’re “making noise” when it’s like early evening, a perfect time to play for kids. Her biggest pet peeve is probably dogs. A few stories above my unit, there’s a family with a dog, and when the dog barks, she barks back and start saying like “Block 200 6th floor at the window your f*cking dog” or whatever idk. What’s worse is that at night a lot of dog owners hang around with their dogs at the park and the dogs are quiet, but she scolds them and makes a fuss. She also says stuff to others about life, like “In Singapore every month you get CPF but in heaven got no CPF”. Or like “Your make up fake you also fake, your nose fake you fake”. And filial piety too. Or like once when i was going home and i was under her block, i coughed, and she coughed back and started scolding me. 

As much as this is insane of her, I feel bad for her. I don’t know what she has gone through to reach that point of insanity, and as much as the neighbourhood is noisier or vulgar because of her, it’s still sad. She does have social workers who come to visit her, as she mentioned before.

I come from an English-speaking family, so since I was a young child, the only situations where I have ever had to speak Mandarin are when I’m speaking to my grandparents, or Mother Tongue classes in primary and secondary school. I did pretty well in my MT, but it all went downhill once I went to poly, and subsequently moved to Australia for uni. All my friends in Singapore are English-speaking too so it doesn’t really help my situation much.  

I admit that I’ve ever thought that I was “too cool” for Mandarin, but right now I feel so disconnected from the language. I feel embarrassed telling people that Singaporeans are educated to be bilingual when I can barely string together a coherent sentence in mandarin without looking like a complete fool. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve tried to speak to Chinese/Taiwanese/Malaysians and even some Australians in Mandarin and completely botch the conversation and they just return blank stares or judgemental looks. 

I’ve also been toying with picking up a third language soon, but I don’t really want to do it before I’m back to being fluent with my second language. 

I’ve recently picked up a book that’s written in Mandarin (LKY’s biography) in hopes that it’ll help my brain’s “muscle memory” and perhaps start to be more fluent. Any other tips you guys might have for me? Online resources would be really helpful! Thanks in advance. :-)

I thought the other ""exit interview"" posted here a while back was interesting, so thought I'd do my own. There is probably some overlap.

A bit about me: ang moh, worked in management, local salary (no expat package), have lived/travelled in various countries around Eurpoe, Africa, and Asia for the past 6 years.

What I liked and some compliments:

- You have some incredible parks and nature here
- It's so clean here!
- It's so safe here!
- Your public transport is amazing. Anybody here complaining about it needs to spend some time in a western country to see how good you have it.
- Your banking and online government services are seriously world-class. I'm going to miss how *convenient* everything is.
- Yes it's bloody hot, but summer all the time is great.
- The ice-cream sandwich uncles! Yam flavour!
- In my experience, your police, immigration, security officers, government workers, etc. were all really kind, professional, respectful, and amazing to deal with.
- Changi Airport... holy shit this is a national treasure. I'm sure after the next part you'll dislike me and that's fine, but if you take one thing from this: please SG, teach the rest of the world the secrets of your airport mastery because nobody else can do it like you.

What I disliked and some criticism:

- Obligatory: rent here is damn expensive! Also, your property industry has some pretty slimy agents.
- The overt racial discrimination here is somewhat shocking to an outsider. E.g. Some property websites advertising ""All Races Welcome"" on apartment listings, and this being seen as progressive... I mean, I guess it's a nice gesture but if you really care so much about the issue, how about be like AirBnb and I don't know... not accept listings from people who discriminate over race?!
- Alcohol prices are obscene, and the bar/club scene is quite pathetic for a city of this size. My guess is this is part of the reason many visitors consider Singapore boring.
- Aside from some nice Indian/Muslim options, hawker center food here is **way** overrated. It's really oily and bland, usually loaded with sugar, salt or MSG to try and compensate, and just overall unhealthy and not very nice.  *ducks*
- The local art/music/festival scene is really weak compared to almost everywhere else in the region (HK, Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand all have much more vibrant, creative scenes. I guess you beat Myanmar and Cambodia?) I don't know how to define it, but it seems most artists/musicians here try to mimic an aesthetic while ignoring the substance of what makes it interesting in the first place. At the same time, they make it painfully obvious the whole purpose is to monetize it. (On that note: isn't it odd that you celebrate counterculture things like graffiti, electronic music (with its rave/drug culture roots) etc. when these things have foundations in rebellion? I mean, here you'd be caned and face serious criminal charges or even death for doing most of what led to this stuff. It could never have originated or been developed here, yet it's still celebrated in a closely monitored, sanctioned box. Just seems sorta dystopian...)
- Speaking of pop culture, your media and especially blogger, YouTube personalities, and so-called ""influencers"" take ""cringe"" to a whole other level... I mean, these people are usually awful everywhere, but here it's like a poor man's copy of the awfulness.
- Business culture here is... challenging. I work in management and virtually all of the local companies/clients/stakeholders I've dealt with take weeks/months to make a decision. Worse, they are extremely cheap yet expect world-class design and development. In my experience, 9 out of 10 times rather than pay a local price or hire Singaporean teams, they will outsource to developing countries (or use a local agency/middleman that outsources to them) for a fraction of the cost. They end up with garbage, and wonder why their website/design looks like it was developed in the 1990s, rather than the gorgeous and modern Silicon Valley design they envisioned. They abandon it and move on to the next idea. Rinse, repeat.
- I'm not sure if Singaporeans are ""cold"", but I'll say this: I have lived in numerous countries around the world and this is the only place I've lived that I haven't made a single local friend (and interestingly enough, SG is the only other place besides my home country with English as an official language.)
- My god people here walk annoyingly slow and stare at their phones a lot... I mean, people in other countries do too but here it is almost comical. This wouldn't be a problem but so many here are oblivious or just don't give a shit about anybody else around them, and always walk in the center making it difficult to walk around them. Ugh just move to the side if your phone keeps you from walking a normal pace.
- Most of your drivers are complete assholes. I've never seen such entitled motorists anywhere else in the developed world. I guess when you pay 3x the value for a car, you can't help but feel like a king that deserves more respect than pedestrians (peasants).
- As a coffee lover, I've never seen a large city with such poor cafes: most are expensive, crowded, and uncomfortable. There is nothing relaxing about hanging out in a cafe here at all. And while I enjoy kopi for what it is, sorry - it is not coffee. *ducks*
- I'm sure it's been effective, but maybe tone down the flood of service announcements dictating acceptable public behaviour? That said, Bag-Down Benny makes me lol every time I see him.
- I don't follow your politics much, but your goverment's ""stability above all"" mantra (and using that to justify cracking down hard on everything they don't like) isn't going to benefit SG forever. They keep preaching the importance of innovation for SG's future, but innovation at its core stems from dissent and challenging norms, and sometimes that's not always harmonious. If it's ingrained in your population from birth to instinctively avoid challenging authority, I don't see much true innovation ever happening here.
- Your government's response to Amos Yee did far, far more damage to SG's reputation than he ever could. This is just an outsider's opinion, but if some vulgar kid trolling on the Internet can be such a threat to your 'social stability', that speaks volumes.
- The mental gymnastics some of you go through to justify your borderline slave labour... come on. I mean, yes, by all means CONGRATS that you are not Qatar or Saudi Arabia in your treatment of foreign workers, but I think deep down you know SG is better than this.

Brief rant on mental healthcare (advice welcome),16,6pezoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6pezoy/brief_rant_on_mental_healthcare_advice_welcome/,33,2017-07-26 01:12:32,"So I just got back from studying abroad and am trying to figure out the whole mental health situation since I am on antidepressants and psychotherapy etc. These were inexpensive when I was a student because I was on university health insurance.

Here are some finds:

* There are no private insurers with comprehensive coverage for outpatient mental health treatment. 
* Medishield only covers inpatient mental health treatment, and Medisave only covers up $400 per year of outpatient treatment (which is like how much I'm projected to spend per month due to the no insurance thing)
* I could go to a polyclinic to get referred to a hospital for subsidized care, but people have told me it'll take months to schedule an appointment with a psychologist, and I kind of need one sooner/on a more regular schedule + am running out of meds, can't wait that long to refill
* Also I work for the government and seriously SERIOUSLY do not want them breathing down my medical records (this is me being extra paranoid)

Maybe I'm just being a privileged snob who's used to fancy university healthcare, but I'm just so frustrated on behalf of myself and everyone living in Singapore with mental illnesses treatable by outpatient care. I'm not overly concerned about myself because I'm living with my fam (~~because moving out is impossibly expensive~~) and can deal with channeling a nontrivial portion of my salary to keeping me somewhat sane, but I feel horrible for people who don't have as much financial security as I do. I don't know what the situation is like in other countries, so this is not a point specific to SG's failure or whatever, but yeah anyways. Ugh. 

If anyone has more comprehensive information or has something to say with regards to my (possibly faulty) research findings, please start a conversation! I admit that when it comes to shit like medical care I'm ignorant af, I'm mostly just a kid trying to adu",tackyaf,I feel like shit

There are many things I love about the U.S., but I've always said that if/when I wanted to start a family, I would go back home. Last night was one of the reasons why: We don't need to wait 4+ years to find out that people aren't happy.


I've been living in the land of rose-tinted glasses. The subway arrives late on a daily basis, and everyone shrugs, mutters under their breath, and moves on. You shouldn't whine about it, or anything else. That's being ""negative"".


But you know what? Fuck that. I smile when I see our broken MRT in the national news, not because it's broken, but because that's our fucking safety relief valve. When we complain about CPF, NS, or politicians who have no PR skills, that's the thing that prevents this country from melting down every five years or so, with half the population in tears and causing the Canadian immigration website to crash.


As an adult, hearing all of you bitch on the internet is like music to my ears, because quite frankly, maybe it's not so bad that none of us have filters and our complaints vacillate between high-level abstractions and trivial shit. And maybe one day the tone of that conversation will change: Maybe one day the disenfranchised will voice concerns that cut deep into the pillars of our society, and we will have to question who we really want to be. But I want to hear that voice before it stuns me by electing an orange.

Let's talk about Jobsbank and job applications in general,69,5xf0mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5xf0mx/lets_talk_about_jobsbank_and_job_applications_in/,65,2017-03-04 19:45:17,"I've seen posts on here before about people applying for jobs - often times this is people that are new to the workforce/a permanent job and they are looking for advice to help them get started. This post isn't for them. This post is for the people with 5-10 years experience that are applying on Jobsbank at the moment.

I imagine many in this position are applying for a large quantity of jobs, but receive no feedback or responses for their efforts. This may become frustrating and make you feel like you're wasting your time. If this is you, you **are** wasting your time - as an employer I'll write out a few basic tips to follow to try and improve your chances of success:

* The **number one** thing to improve your chances of success are to *read the job description carefully and decide whether you have the required skills for the job*

I've just reviewed three applications for a job posting I made yesterday. The *job title* was clear and showed I was looking for a specific set of experience. The description of the role clearly articulated a set of skills that would be necessary for success in the role. This was not an entry level position - it's ~$10k a month - and I would expect those that are applying to at least have **some** of the skills I've listed before they send in their CV. 

All three CV's were skimmed and sent to the bin. I did at least update Jobsbank to show they were unsuccessful - more for my own benefit so I know I've already rejected them. 

**If you can't be bothered to sanity check whether you are a fit for the position, why should I owe you a response after you've wasted my time reviewing your CV?**

* Number two on the list is to customise your application once you've identified that you are a match against the job description

In my case I'm asking for a set of skills that are listed in the JD. You have your CV written up in word, hopefully you also have a cover letter template available too. Don't just write ""RE: Position as Advertised"" or some such shit - customise that. How long does it take to copy the Job Title and paste it into a template? How quickly could you type an introductory paragraph explaining your desire for the role, then flagging 3-5 of your key skills that mean you're suited to the task?

This may seem like it's an onerous waste of time if you're used to rejection - however this is where the work done in Point #1 really helps. By pre-qualifying yourself OUT of jobs you stand no chance of getting you are able to dedicate MORE time to applying to those that you have relevant skills for

* Number three - for the love of God **use the fucking spell check feature on word!!!**

This shouldn't need me to write it, but given you've sent me a word based CV (why? turn it into a PDF please), then you know I can see all the spelling errors and grammatical mistakes highlighted in red and green. I also know you must have seen these because it's a standard feature of the product. **If you're too lazy to correct mistakes in a CV/job application then why would I want to hire you?**

* Bonus - number 4: customise your CV for each application

If you can be bothered then this will help too. I'd suggest having a section where you list your key skills, somewhere near the top of the document (where I'm more likely to read it). Clearly after 5-10 years you'll have picked up a range of ""key skills"" - so why not flag the ones that are applicable to my Job Description?

In all of these points you'll notice that I'm asking you to make my job easier - as a hiring manager I want to see a CV/Cover letter jump out at me and make me keen to call the guy straight away. This is exactly what you want to achieve with the application too - so do the legwork for the hiring manager and make it as easy as possible for them to call you up to interview. 

* Side notes

If you're bothering to do this level of customisation then you need to store the CV/Cover letter alongside the job description for future reference - there's no point making this effort then showing up to Interview and not knowing what you've applied for. This isn't that hard, and doesn't add much time to the application process.

**TL;DR**
Applicants need to put more effort into ensuring they apply for the right job, with the right CV and cover letter tailored for each role. If YOU put the effort in then you'll get better returns from each application you ma",zoinks10,I feel like shit

Let's share the worst experiences we've had/inflicted on OKC/Tinder/Paktor/Grindr/etc. ~~to find out if any of our dates lurk here~~ for shits and giggles.

Start off with mea culpas - I have, over the greater part of the past decade or so:

> copypasta intro message and personalise a bit like sending cover letter for job interview; ladies, if you ever got addressed by the wrong name, this is why

> used the excuse ""sorry ah, got dinner waiting at home"" to quickly siam from unsalvageable dates

> brought countless dates on awkward visits to Kinokuniya/Esplanade because must macam appear cultured but no money

> also no money but must go out; ""eh Changi Airport is free to loiter around in right? Got a sofa and some twisty slide some more."" Did not actually end up going on slide

> brought date to Clarke Quay; chased down waterfront by aggro transsexual local fauna

> brought date up Mount Faber; too tired and sweaty to do anything later

> brought date to Starbucks during 1-for-1 season; ultimate kiam kana achievement unlocked

In exchange, have endured the following:

> shortly after making out: ""sorry ah, I'm actually confused over someone else, let's just be friends k?""

> before date: ""people say I look like Jamie Yeo you know!"" during date: AAAH THE PIMPLES HAVE PIMPLES ON THEM

> ""i feel wrong going out with you if you don't believe...have you considered letting Jesus into you?"" I wanted to ask you a variation on that question, but now...nah.

> ""oh, I'm actually into girls more, I don't really like guys much"" THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE WITH ME

> waiting right outside dinner place at 7pm: ""hey, I'll be late, can I meet you ard 930? thx!!'

> ""So what's your job like?"" ""oh...office la"" ""What do you do for fun?"" ""oh nothing much rly"" ""Anything interesting happen lately?"" ""no"" OK THE WEATHER'S NICE ISN'T IT

> stays mute throughout most of date; after leaving, get a text saying ""So, what did you think about us?""

> ""Where's your car parked?"" ""I took the bus."" *awkward silence*

I'd be pretty handy in case some shit goes down or to record a split second event of interest.

But how would you feel if you're sitting on an MRT and the guy across you is wearing a body cam, not for anything malicious but knowing basically everyone is recording everyone.

Why is it that Channel 8 productions are still shitty?,48,53ht9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/53ht9u/why_is_it_that_channel_8_productions_are_still/,86,2016-09-20 06:31:39,"Ever since young till now I realized Channel 8 shows never change, its still the shitty same old soap opera with bare minimum acting and mediocre cinematography, even the current 4th season of CLIFF is as generic as every other shows. Opening title sequences are still cheesy and generic, I've never found a Singaporean T.V show with an intro I really like, Here's some of my favorite, 

The Pacific (Band of Brothers was considered a better show but I felt that The Pacific's intro had a stronger emotional Impact)

The Man in the High Castle

Narcos (Personally my favorite)

House of Cards (Its a modernization of the original's intro and theme and it drags for a bit but some shots are extremely beautiful and captivating) 
https://vimeo.com/99061723

There are many more great title sequences out there but I can't fit them all in here.

Also the acting, there are plenty of good Singaporean actors I'm sure but I just don't see it so often, I'm saddened that I've never found a scene by a Singaporean actor that stands out as much some of these.

House of Cards (Kevin Spacey's performance really kills it)

The Dark Knight (We all know Heath Ledger did a great job, Rest In Peace)

No Country For Old Men (Script writing was top notch)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLCL6OYbSTw

Breaking Bad (Super awesome show)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWfK5JyD2bA

All these actors brought chills my spine from the execution of the dialogue, I haven't found any Channel 8 actor who could do that, maybe its just the writing I don't know...

Cinematography for many Channel 8 shows are still mediocre, its all the same, no expression, no use of color or creative camera angles. There are a lot of great examples out there on how to make a conversation scene interesting or how to intensify an action of a character, or even create suspense or to amaze us with the beauty of the world.

Finally, there's the action, fighting scenes are still pretty bad if you ask me, too many cuts preventing consistency, doesn't feel exciting just plain bad to look at. (I'll stop flooding here with examples from now onwards)

So yeah, hopefully some day we'll get a show that is well written, directed and acted. But for the time being I'll stick to watching shows recommended online.

After changing from mrt to bus, my stomach goes full on ache-mode and I have to play every last game on my phone to distract myself. 

I guess what I want to ask is, I have a super weak stomach. I usually take a shit every morning and then once more after lunch (especially if the food is oily or contains dairy) and then maybe after dinner. I really wish my stomach was stronger (but it's not). 

I'm enlisting next Tuesday and I'm just wondering how's the toilet break situation. Like, if my stomach really is in pain, will I be able to break away or do I have to lan lan suck thumb shit in my pants? I don't mind if the toilet is gross as long as I can get my shit out ya 

edit: thanks for all your responses, especially those who weren't snarky! I really didn't know there was such a chronic problem LOL thought it was just weak stomach genes cus my mum's like this too. Will definitely sound out to MO if it becomes a persistent problem. Glad to hear I can take toilet breaks, and I actually prefer squat toilets over sitting ones because it feels wayyy more shiok.

The issue of cyclist and pedestrians in Singapore,18,5q9igs,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5q9igs/the_issue_of_cyclist_and_pedestrians_in_singapore/,32,2017-01-27 02:33:07,"I've been recently seeing a shit ton of articles or forum letters that seem to be picking on cyclist, and putting them at fault for many issues, hogging of the road, not giving way, ringing the bell(lol this is the worse, they are trying to warn you)

As both a cyclist and pedestrian, both sides are terrible, I can tell you that. The cycling culture in Singapore is fucking terrible. There is zero respect for each side, and both side bitch about the other being at fault.

First of all, we have a somewhat sizable cycling system in SG, but the bloody peds seem to love walking on the cycling track rather than the pedestrian path right next to it. What the hell man. Especially in the situation of living in Tampines. 

The MRT track leading to Tampines Mall is just terrible. The cycling track is located right under the MRT track, thus providing shelter, but it is also narrow as fuck. Meanwhile, you got a huge ass pedestrian path right beside where you can probably turn it into a runway. Problem? People hate the sun and rain, so they walk on the cyclist track. Cyclist like riding without having to worry about hitting anyone, so they take the pedestrian path. And now, you have pedestrians clogging up the narrow cycling track, and then you got the cyclist going on high speeds on the pedestrian pathways. 

Worse, when there is a church service and it ends, the throngs of people coming out of the church mass the cyclist track, and its annoying as fuck trying to get people to move out of the way.

Now, on to being a pedestrian. What really fucking annoys is when cyclist give you that passive aggressive behavior, you are walking on a narrow sidewalk, and they choose to CYCLE AS FUCKING SLOWLY AS THEY CAN, instead of pushing their bikes. It makes me feel like I need to walk faster so they could get the hell out of my way (usually I just walk even slower) and usually its uncles and aunties.

Then, there are people saying cyclist belong on the road with cars. THEN WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT OF THE CYCLING TRACK. Wa lao, all that govt spending and you want them to be sharing roads with cars? Drivers have to watch out for them, and your wannabe lance armstrong folks think the road belong to their lao jiao. Its bloody dangerous for both parties.

And not to forget, there's a push on the cyclist, that they should watch out for pedestrian on the cycling tracks. Why not have signs telling pedestrians to do the same? Same understanding ma.

While it may be different to other countries, you try this shit in cities like Amsterdam or Copenhagen, try walking on the cycling track, and you hear your mother, father, entire family generation being called out. Its a culture of equal understanding in other countries, you respect the cyclists, they in turn, respect the pedestrians. Why can't we have the same? We seriously need to start having better understanding for both parties.

A comprehensive guide on how to excel in SCDF as recruit (PTP + BRT phase),47,4wkknv,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4wkknv/a_comprehensive_guide_on_how_to_excel_in_scdf_as/,50,2016-08-08 03:53:48,"First up, congratulations to all future cadets that will be serving your NS in SCDF. I will tell you that you are some lucky b**t**ds! 

Secondly, I just want to clear the air for those ignorant parents out there. The current and recent intake do not only recruit ""ITE and certless"" guys OR Malays OR PRs.  There are plenty of Singapore born and raised Chinese diploma holders serving SCDF as of the latest intake. 

Be prepared to face well mannered people inside. (There is one exception and I will explain below) 

There are 4 companies (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta) 

Alpha & Charlie (Less Fit intake - PTP, serving full 2 years) 

Bravo (Fit Squad - BRT, serving 1 year 10 months) 

Delta (Fat Squad - PTP, Serving full 2 years)

No personal attacks on Delta company but it's very obvious when you see delta, you know it is them. 

Not sure if your certificates determine your company, but from what I observe, Bravo has 95% diploma holders, Charlie 80% of diploma holders. Each company has around 120 cadets. 

Next up, I will start from the routine and regimentation. 

For Alpha, Charlie, you need to wake up at 5.45. Bravo wakes up at 5.15. I have no idea what time Delta guys wake up. 

You will wake up to do a short 5-10mins water parade, then move on to gather as a company level for morning 5bx. 5BX exercises are purely for warming up and waking you up for the day. If you go to the gym or do regular exercises on your daily routine, 5bx is nothing - Easy af. Unless that particular Company CDI (Instructor) decides to make you guys to exercise more, then too bad. Every morning there should be one appointed Sir + CDI. 

Greet them every fucking time, don't forget your manners. This is something many recruits tend to not do because they feel embarrassed or not used to it. If you want to do well in SCDF, be smart about all the small details. The CDI / Sirs will teach you how to greet. 

Another important thing to note, always remember at the back of your head - This is NS, you WILL be treated like a dog. Pick up some street smarts, just tolerate. It is alright to be screamed/yelled at, at the end of the day, it is the CDI/Sirs' job to do that. They don't REALLY hate you. 

Things to bring: 
1. Buy 2-3 pairs of dri fit underwear/briefs, reason being, you can wash in the washing machine and dry it on the SAME day. Don't buy disposable, it's for pussies. Learn to wash your fuckin undies boys. Don't have to bring so many, 2-3 for 14 days confinement week is enough, just remember to wash. 

2. Try not to bring any Tshirt other than the one you wore on first book in day, reason being, SCDF will provide you LOTS of PT kits, Dri Fit admin kits, you don't want to mess up your whole locker. Your locker is very small. Don't fill it up with unnecessary things. 

3. Contraband items, be smart and don't get caught or don't bring at all. Advices for smokers - Don't smoke. I'm not kidding, you will be so tired that you won't feel like smoking. 

4. Bring indicator coloured tapes - This is for your water bottles, bags etcetera. Reason - when the sirs ask you to mix up all of your water bottles, you only have 10s to find your own water bottle, make your bottle stand out so you can find it easily. If one b**ta*d gets sick, the whole lot gets sick. No joke, you don't want to get light duty or fall out. 

5. Any spray-able items are NOT allowed. Medications that do not prescribed your names on it are NOT allowed. So don't bother bringing panadols in. Unless your instructors are nice enough to keep it for you and give you throughout the week.

6. Portable Charger(a strong charger) , you are NOT allowed to use the socket to charge phone and this is enforced in the camp. So be responsible if you want to use your phone, there will be idiots borrowing your charger, so just get ready for this. 

7. Hangers are optional, most bunks have EXCESS hangers left by previous batches. Bring if you are kiasu, don't bring if you want to take your chances. 

8. Febreez and Easy On Double Starch Spray. You only need 1 febreez if you constantly wash your clothes, easy on double starch x2. This is for your POP parade. (Additional info, you will be receiving a $50 fairprice voucher, if you want to wait for the voucher before buying these things, you can do so. These two items are not super urgent)

9. Laundry net and label it with your name. There will be a lot of people using the washing machines, so remember to label it. Bring detergent powder as well.

10. Permanent Marker. (SCDF will give you a blue pen, pencil and highlighter but not permanent marker)

-----------------------------------------

PTP phase has way more exercises and foot drills training. They are structured in a way to push cadets to pass their IPPT. So if you are in the PTP squad, be prepared to be overwhelmed by exercises, PTs, lots of foot drills. Best Battalion will only goes to PTP squad due to PTP batch staying there for 3 months while BRT squad has only 1 month. PTP squad will also have the chance to enter foot drill team and participate in foot drills competition (if that is something you are interested in) 

My take? Not worth the 2 months extra if you can exercise on your own and pass IPPT. 

After PTP for 2 months, your last month will be the BRT phase. BRT is mostly made up of Rescue trainings, Medical trainings & CEPT test. CEPT test is a 5 station test that test your knowledge on equipments (Tifor Wrench, Power Saw, Oxycutter, {KNOTS - Clove Hitch, Figure of 8 knot, bowline, shipben, reef knot}, and Spreader) 

There are points given to each station, mainly depend on how fast you can operate these equipments. The points will be group into First Class, Second and Third Class. For those who wants to crossover to Seccoms, try to get most first class. There should be 0 third class. From what I heard, this test is only a small determine factor. 

Next test will be your medical trainings - CPR for unconscious, Abdominal Thrusts, Compressions for choking, all of which includes Adult and Baby versions. 

Lastly will be your height and depth training  + rescue mission. 
 
Rescue mission you will be sent to civil defence academy, a place call RUINS. You will need to go there and apply the knowledge you've accumulated for the past 1 month to rescue a few casualties. Fake Section commanders will be appointed to lead the team. 

Height and depth training will be conducted at a place called furnace, you will know by then.

Every time when you queue up for food, queue at the last so you can get more food, when you queue up, your hands must be behind your back, like prisoners. You are not allowed to talk when you're queuing up for food. If you get caught for talking, you will be punished. 

On Punishments, get punish on circumstances where your higher ups have grown to LIKE to punish you and not punish you for stupid mistakes. Sometimes, getting punished might not be an entirely bad thing, I have seen guys from my batch getting punished and end up getting big roles appointed from the higher ups. Those who kept quiet and want to do well and don't socialise and stay out of trouble all the time, you are screwed instead. This is very counter intuitive, you have to have a high EQ to understand this point. You will have higher ups that are Malays and younger than you. There are some form of favouritism but do your best to get along with them if you are a non-Muslim. Lastly to close off this point, enjoy yourself getting punished. 

On food, the food is not bad. You won't go hungry, that is for sure. Muslim food is ALWAYS better than non-Muslim. Observe this phenomenon yourself. 

On vocations, 
If you are a trouble-maker, and I mean the negative type. The kind that people hate. Get ready to enter SRU. (No disrespect to SRU) If you are dip holder, most of the time you will crossover to CDA. You will NOT get section commander immediately, vocations will only be disclosed after you POP. Cadets need to go through a 4 weeks course before being segregated into SCC / FFC. You will need to earn your rights into SCC. 

*Additional info: Word out is that vocations are pre-determined based on your qualifications and Pes Status, however, you might have no choice if you f-up your BRT phase. They will give you a ""freedom of choice"" - 3 options on the first week of BRT, asking you where you want to be posted to. So, consider that really carefully. 

In conclusion, this is one of the luckiest vocation you can get not because that this is easy. I will tell you it is f tough. And if commandos are being put through this shit, not necessarily they will survive. If you get posted to fire stations, congratulations, you will have job fulfilment for the rest of your army life by saving people and do real shit.  

Share if it helps, good luck future recruits. Cheers

A guide on how to survive SPF's Basic Police Training (BPT) as a Trainee Special Constable,73,4wp3am,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4wp3am/a_guide_on_how_to_survive_spfs_basic_police/,41,2016-08-09 00:09:22,"First and foremost, I'm sure this won't be much of a guide but i think it'll help you have a rough picture of how life is like as a recruit in SPF. 

To start things off, NSFs are addressed as Special Constable (SC). Trainee Special Constable = Recruit.  If you really want to know what it means you can google it. As a recruit, you'll have to greet everyone who is not a recruit. Also, I'll try my best to cover the basic things without revealing too much because y'know, OSA.


The intake is divided into Less Fit (PTP) and Fit. Well the Less Fit one enlist two months earlier than the Fit intake but you guys do pretty much the same shit and it gives you more free time. Like SAF and SCDF, we do have companies but they are not very significant. There are 6 companies, Alpha to Foxtrot. These ""companies"" are actually the name of the building where your bunks are located. So if your bunk is at Foxtrot then you're part of Foxtrot company. In each company there will be approx 10-15 squads. Each squad comprises of roughly 35 TSCs. 


I'm not sure how it is now but when I enlisted, we were segregated based on our certificates. There were 2 squads comprising of diploma holders while the rest of the squads comprised of ITE/PSLE/etc. It is true that majority of your mates are Malay but I feel that there are sufficient amount of people of other races to make everyone feel like it is home, truly.. okay I digress.

I don't even remember what i brought to camp but aside from the uniforms, I remember getting talcum powder, some useless plastic shaver made to cut your face and a ""field pack"". 

Things to bring:

1. Hangers because either they don't provide any or you'll only receive one or two of it. 

2. Detergent. You can use the washing machine (subjected to Instructor's or Commander's approval) or you can hand-wash. I prefer hand-washing to be honest. 

3. Some comfortable shorts and t-shirts to sleep. The PT kit is not the most comfortable thing to sleep in.

4. ~~Medicines are generally okay. Just inform your instructor.~~

Things not to bring:

1. Chargers. Unless you're appointed as squad IC, no one can use the wall socket to charge. You cant even bring portable chargers.

2. Camera phones. 

3. Food. Not until your company commander allows you to. 

4. Cigarettes. Because you cannot smoke in MHA buildings. If you're caught with cigarettes or smoking, your whole squad can be confined over the weekend and you might be confined for two consecutive weekends. 

5. Medicines. As informed in the comments, medicines are strictly forbidden unless it is prescribed to you.

You'll have water parade every morning and evening and you have to scream ""Courage, Loyalty, Intergrity, Fairness (Your company name)!"" at the top of your freaking lungs before you can drink. ~~There is also flag raising parade every morning.~~ Flag raising parades are only held on Friday mornings now. 

You'll have a Field Instructor assigned to your squad and he will be the one who conducts your PTs and Footdrills. You'll have classes everyday and you'll learn about basic police procedures (including scenario based trainings where you'll have to ""attend"" to a case), shooting and some basic laws. These classes are conducted by regular officers who are usually on loan from the different land divisions to impart knowledge through their experiences.

Before you POP you'll have to sit for an exam which you will confirm pass one. You will also have to pass your IPPT before you POP. If you're an A level or Diploma holder, you'll pass out as an SC/Corporal if you pass both your law exam and ippt. Private dip holders will not be promoted to Corporal upon BPT completion. For ITE and etc, just like private dip holders, you'll pass out as an SC. Also, everyone will have to go through a psychometric test before passing out. In my opinion, this will determine your vocation. You'll still be given 3 choices but don't put too much hope on it. SCs will also be promoted approximately halfway through your service. This depends on your performance and conduct. 

There are a few vocations to choose from namely PCG, SOC, Transcom, PIC, Sentry, SA, FI, NPCO/GRF, NSOSO, APD, K9 unit and OCT (OCS).

1. PCG: Police Coast Guard. You'll have to go through a few weeks at one of their bases before being posted to various teams and ships to keep the waters surrounding our island safe and secured. 

2. SOC: Special Operations Command. Riot police. Few weeks of training at their base too. Physically and mentally demanding but worth the sweat. 

3. Transcom: You all should know la. No training but got a few lessons upon induction. Keep the public transport safe and respond to some cases located at public transport related areas. 

4. PIC: Person-In-Custody. Basically either you jaga lock up or you go ops room to dispatch calls. 

5. Sentry (SSO): Sentry duty for the whole of your NS life. 

6. SA: Staff Assistant. Basically office hours doing administrative things. 

7. FI: Field Instructor. I forgot how long the training is but to be a qualified FI you'll have to go through multiple fitness and drill tests. 

8. NPCO/GRF: Neighbourhood Police Centre Officer/Ground Response Force. Basically your vocation is.. to do what police officers do. You'll have to go through extra 3 months of training in HTA then you'll be posted to various different divisions and NPCs. In the course of training, those without class 3 licence will be sent to CDC to learn and get your licence within 1 and a half months for free. If you're looking for a fulfilling NS life, this is the vocation for you. 

9. NSOSO: Staff Assistants who are deployable during events etc.

10. APD: Airport Police Division. Patrolling airport, sometimes alongside SAF Personnels, and attending to emergency calls at the airport.

11. K9-Unit: Self-Explanatory. 

12. OCT: Officer Cadet Trainee. There is also a possibility for you to be absorbed into the Officer Cadet programme where you'll pass out as an NS Inspector but you'll have to ace every single test including shooting and IPPT. On top of that, you'll have to go through an interview with the commander of basic training wing. Having a diploma or an A level cert is also part of the requirement. I've heard that NS Inspector (Post training) life is very boring so unless you really want to be an officer for the sake of being an officer, don't bother because you will probably be given a desk bound vocation.

That's all i have for now. I'm actually at work and bored to my wits because i just came back from two weeks off. Sorry my formatting is a little messy. If there are anything that is outdated or to be add on, feel free to leave a comment. 

Edit: Formatting

[PSA] Manging your Singpass account,37,40l7ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/40l7ar/psa_manging_your_singpass_account/,52,2016-01-12 21:55:41,"[This is totally not an AMA /s]

I work in a certain government agency and users will have to use their Singpass account. It really astonish me how out of the hundreds of enquiries, almost 50% is alway ""How to reset your password?""

https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/requestOnlineReset/requestOnlineResetTermsCheck

**There's 3 ways to reset your password.**

(1) Go to the counter and get a new one on the spot. Click on [Counter Locations](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/counter) to know where's the closest one to you.

(2) Get your Singpass via mail. Click [here](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/mailMyPassword/mailMyPasswordTermsCheck), fill up the form and the password will be mailed to your registered address as what's on your National Registration card.

(3) Reset your password [online](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/requestOnlineReset/requestOnlineResetTermsCheck). But like all online accounts, you will need to have your account updated with either a mobile number and/or email address to get your password. If you have not done so, how did you expect the password to be sent to you?

* Error message ""Invalid user ID or password"" means you've keyed in the wrong Singpass ID or password.... Duh!
* Error message ""We are unable to verify your account, please reset your password"" means you need to reset your password coz you're account is locked
* 6 attempts with the wrong password will get your account locked. This totally retarded feature is to prevent ""hackers"" from using ""brute force"" (trying every single password till they get the correct one)
* If you request a password by mail, it is not a password but a One-Time-Password which is valid only once and expired in 30 days.
* Don't use Safari evar!!! You use Safari, you're gonna have a bad time.
* [Video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSMuDGIEZrk)

**Singpass ID**

* It is by default your NRIC and FIN including the letters
* You can change your Singpass ID to be other than your NRIC/FIN. Login to your account, go to Update account details and edit your Singpass ID. This is only a **one time change** and further changes will involve a lot of paperwork and approval. http://i.imgur.com/8tpthvU.jpg?1
* If you forgot your Singpass ID after you change it, you can have it SMS or emailed to you from [Retrieve Singpass ID](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/retrieveaccount/termsandconditions). You will need to have already registered your handphone and/or email or it won't work.

**Managing your account details**

* Logging in to your Singpass account for the first time will prompt you to add a local mobile number (mandatory), email address (optional) and create a minimum of 2 security questions
* Note: **You cannot have the same mobile number and email on multiple accounts.** So no sharing.
* [Video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAL7Jk2j26M)
* You can manage your account details by logging into your account and click ""update account details""
* You can replace your current mobile number with another valid and unused mobile number
* You **cannot** remove your mobile number online, it can only be done at a [Counter Locations](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/counter)
* You can replace and remove your email address with another valid and unused email address
* You can change your security question and answers at any time as long as you can log in. Tip: Don't provide answers you will forget.... Duh!

**I don't have a mobile number**

* Temporary solution: [Click the big red text which for some reason a lot of people can't find](http://i.imgur.com/MNntfem.jpg?1)
* A prepaid number that can receive SMSs are a valid number
* If you truly can't get a number, you can go to a Singpass counter and request to OTP out from the mobile number requirement. Please add in an email address and security question afterwards if you want to reset your password online in the future.
* If you do not have a mobile number and is overseas for a long period of time, you must have your registered address changed to an overseas address. Your mobile number requirement is automatically removed

**Managing 2fa**

http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-more-secure-singpass-with-2-step-verification-system-to-roll-out-on-july-5

The 2-factor authentication or 2-step verification or 2fa will be mandatory by this year July. If you don't have it working by then, you'll have a hard time.

Things you need to take note of

* The 2fa is outsourced to a different company called Assurity. You will need to have an registered [Onekey account](http://www.onekey.sg/) with them.
* Remember these steps: Step 1 (Register) -> Step 2 (Activate) -> Step 3 (Link to Singpass)
* You can register for a Onekey token or a Onekey SMS or both. Pro-tip: Get both. A lot of people were like ""I'm just gonna get the SMS coz is more convenient"" and then they lost their handphone and is up shit creek without a phone.
* You can register directly from the [Onekey website](http://www.onekey.sg/) or indirectly from your Singpass account by clicking ""Setup 2-step verification"" in your account or go down to their counter at [International plaza](http://www.onekey.sg/contact-us.html)
* Your registered Onekey SMS is based on your Singpass contact detail. So if you use someone else's contact detail as your Singpass contact detail, you're gonna have a bad time.
* If you registered online, your 2fa needs to be activated through your [Onekey account](http://www.onekey.sg/). Your activation code will be to your registered mail. If you're at the counter, your account is activated on the spot.
* After activating your 2fa on your [Onekey account](http://www.onekey.sg/), you will need to link your 2fa to your Singpass account. Login to your Singpass account, click on ""Setup 2-step verification"" and just link your 2fa.
* Once linked, you can manage your 2fa on your Singpass through the ""Manage 2-step verification"" and set your preferred method.

All I currently do is wash my face with a face wash that's lying in the shower (I think it's cetaphil) and put some regular [Nivea](http://i.imgur.com/FdyVlzx.jpg) cream on my face after my shower.

"I'm the hoarder's daughter, I'm back and I need advice please",70,3swp8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3swp8o/im_the_hoarders_daughter_im_back_and_i_need/,31,2015-11-16 08:24:52,"Hi r/singapore, remember me? I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/) a while back and I've gotten so many kind responses from you all. Thank you for that. I thought the best way to try and begin solving this problem would to get my mum to see a counsellor. However, in the recent month, my relationship with my mum has deteriorated so much because I started being stricter and questioning her purchases. She now tells me that she's disgusted by my character cos I remind her of my dad. As of today, we haven't been on good terms for weeks and our maximum interaction per day would be maybe her shouting at me on 10 separate occasions. She asks me to shut up almost every time I speak or threaten me with violence/her health, so it's obviously futile trying to talk her into seeing a counsellor. Honestly, the way she's been treating me's so bad I considered moving out but it was always still just an idea I toyed with at the back of my head. Until today.

Today I was cleaning out my room and I moved my luggage that was behind the door cos I wanted to fill it with stuff to bring to salvation army. My luggage's behind the door and has been there for as long as I remember (my door thus doesn't open fully). Today I moved it out for the first time in months (seeing as I've not travelled anywhere) and this stench reached my nose and my heart just dropped. It was the familiar (to me) smell of dead cockroache**s**. I don't even know how many people on here would recognize that smell. FUCK ME 3 COCKROACHES RAN OUT AND THERE'S ROTTING WOOD FUCK IF U WANNA LOOK AT IT [HERE'S A PIC](http://i.imgur.com/6oMqGtX.jpg) 

Somehow, despite having lived with cockroaches for years, that just triggered something inside me. I think it's because. My room has always been a sanctuary in this shit hole I live in and now it's fucking compromised. I fucking give up. I fucking give up on trying to fix her. I want out. What the fuck did I do to deserve living in a house like this with a hoarder like her. Jesus??? u giving me a chance to be a fucking testimonial???? FUCK?????? WHY ME?????????? I'm fucking weak I'm not strong enough to take this shit 

Right now I'm seriously considering running away from home but I know the implications are going to be huge and my life would be completely messed up. At this point, I don't think it's teenage angst anymore and I really need to get the hell out of this place. It's fucking tiring to come home to this shit every day. I can't take it anymore okay. I can't stand being unable to open the main door more than 45 degrees wide because there's stuff behind it, can't stand seeing so much junk everywhere, can't stand going to the toilet in the dark and having to manually flush it with a bucket of water, can't stand not having a working ceiling light in my room, can't stand having to live in secrecy, can't stand THE FUCKING COCKROACHES.

I'm seriously considering leaving this house. Please give me advice if you have ever left home successfully or know of someone who did. Right now I have a few options:

* **Moving in with my dad**: I think this would be the most viable option seeing as my dad should still be responsible for me as a parent. I think he would be willing to take me in as well. But this option would be the most harmful to my relationships as my entire maternal side would see me as a traitor to my mum due to the sob stories she's always telling them. Despite my strained relationship with my mum, I'm very fond of my maternal cousins so I don't know if it's worth cutting them off for the sake of a better living place.

* **Moving in with an aunt or uncle**: My mum has 6 siblings, 4 of which are married, and of those 4 I would be comfortable living in the households of 3 of them. However, I'm really not sure how would I approach this subject with them, and if I would be able to carry the guilt of probably ruining their sibling relationship forever. Yet I feel like it may be easier to reconcile with my mum and have her realize the gravity of her actions should I leave to stay temporarily with one of her siblings.

* **Moving in with a friend**: This is my last option I guess. I'm not too fond of this option as it would mean putting additional burden on someone whom I'm not related to and isn't obliged to be so kind to me. However I feel like it would lessen the chance of my maternal family turning their backs on me and would also not compromise any of their intraextendedfamily(????) relationships.

* **Begging my school to let me stay in their boarding school**: This way I wouldn't be putting burden on anyone else except probably me to try and find money to pay the boarding fees. Just that idk if they would be willing to compromise to let a graduating student stay with them. (ps I'm 1 year closer to graduation than I stated in my original post ps)

I'm very messed up right now and unable to weigh the pros and cons and I feel fucking stupid for asking strangers for advice on this but literally any input would be nice because I can't think right now, all that's in my head is iwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveout. I may delete this post in the morning if my brain clears up and I get this urge out of my system but I think there's a high chance it won't, as I am really fucking sick and tired of this shit. (edit: I have a 13 y/o brother and idk if I should bring him with me should I really move out. I'm a bit scared it will drive my mum crazy though since her whole life practically revolves around us. also my bro is closer to my mum than I am if that info means anything. and I've talked to him before about the state our house is it but he doesn't seem as affected as I am wtf? so idk what to do with him because I'll be worried about how the mum treats him too)

Turns out all of us have a hatred for certain races in Singapore and this shitpost truly helped us think of a final solution. The top 3 most hated races, which should be cleansed from our society, are the 'rat race', the 1.6km/2.4 km race transition, and the lesser-known Khatib Camp Life Run which is a whopping 5km.

Can't really give out prizes for these, as we all played a part, but let it be known that /u/dreadpiratewombat nominated the former and /u/TheCrazyabc brought the latter to our attention.

Alright...like in every election, after the votes are counted, some NMPs are chosen. These NMPs have not been voted in to a specific constituency (category) but are recognised here as top contributors. 

For **least inactive mod** - just kidding, all the mods are great except for me - we have /u/tehokosong. Why has he been recognised? Because of the high-quality content that he brings to /r/singapore above and beyond his modding duties. For example, the cultural exchanges with [Iran](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3yg8q8/cultural_exchange_with_riran/) and [Denmark](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3wmp37/cultural_exchange_w_denmark/) which both ran amazingly smoothly.

What's your opinion on people who cut off contact with their parents?,10,459oeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/459oeh/whats_your_opinion_on_people_who_cut_off_contact/,39,2016-02-12 08:42:52,"I know of a friend who's been facing some serious (mainly emotional) abuse at home and I'm worried for her safety and mental health. She says that when she starts uni this year, she'll stay in hall and when she graduates, she'll find a place to stay away from her parents and limit contact with them. From what she tells me, I think it's kinda justified because her parents do say some really inexcusable shit to her.

It got me thinking, and personally, I think that while there are two sides to each story and neither side might be blameless, I feel like there's a limit as to how much filial piety covers and when the parents are overstepping the line, and sometimes cases of adult children cutting off contact with their parents can be quite understandable. However, in an Asian society like ours, I think what comes to mind for most people on hearing that someone is estranged from their parents is that they think of the person as 不孝顺/unfilial. So I just wanted to ask you guys, what do you think of when you find out someone are estranged from their parents?

Advice needed,72,3ojbwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3ojbwk/advice_needed/,28,2015-10-13 18:50:33,"Hello r/singapore. I'm feeling pretty shitty right now so please excuse a lot of things. I'm sorry in advance if I offend or come off as an ass. Throwaway bc I don't wish to associate this issue with my main account.

I'm currently 19 years old in poly going at internship. Due to reasons, I currently am living in a rented place with my farher over 60 years of age. He's going to be out of his hawker job in a month, and we are getting evicted because the lease is ending in the next 2 weeks. He doesn't own a house of his own, and I'm not legal enough to do so.

His CPF has less than 10k and his savings are unknown. It seems that he is counting on me to support him. I resent that, but will immediately start working my ass off after poly. I have no plans for further education.

I've tried appealing to HDB and they got back after 28 freaking days telling me they couldn't help me, period. No BTO, no rent. I'm SOL.

So, I'm feeling pretty shitty right now. I've been in this situation since I was 16, and I feel beyond stressed and upset. Every year we pack up our stuff and move. I want to do a lot of things, but space is always an issue and I never get around to getting the equipment and doing them. I try to be positive, but I have times like these where I cannot muster to fart a single rainbow out of my ass. I can't see a good future and feel like no one can help me.

In any case, I'm appealing for advice. To make shit feel less heavy. Is there any organization or people that can offer help? Fiancially speaking, I'm alright for now, but emotionally I feel like selling off everything and giving all that money to him and offing myself so he can have a good retirement life.

EDIT: apparently this post has been shadow banned. As for whether or not it will even be approved, I can't be arsed anymore. I need to focus on my intern.

Weird things happened and I am in need of spiritual advice with a Singaporean context (serious),32,2iywsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2iywsm/weird_things_happened_and_i_am_in_need_of/,64,2014-10-12 11:51:55,"**TLDR SPOOKY SHIT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND AND I NEED ADVICE**

Apologies in advance that this might be badly written and not all that coherent, it's 3.30 AM in the morning and I have no idea where to really begin.

Let me just get this out of the way, I'm not particularly superstitious (or at all), but a few recent events have made me reconsider things. 

I met my girlfriend about a month ago while overseas, and about a week later we went for another trip to Msia. During our stay in Msia, we checked into a hotel room and had some pretty bad experiences there. At about 5 in the morning, she saw a woman in white hovering over us near the ceiling with long hair covering the face. She then asked me to switch on the lights, and afterwards we went down to the hotel lobby to calm ourselves. I however, didn't actually see anything at this point. So after confronting the manager for about 20 minutes and bugging the hell out of him whilst getting nothing in return, we decided to return to the hotel room. (Probably should mention at this point that we were on the 4th floor, which was conveniently renamed to 3A) I called my friend who knew a bit of Islamic prayer, asked him to pray for us and the two of us drifted off to sleep with the lights on. 

The next day (which really is 4 hours later), she decided to shower first. After her shower when it was my turn, she decided she wasn't too comfortable with staying in the room along while I showered, so I was left alone. All was fine and dandy, and the warm shower was actually taking my mind of things when I turned to my left. There was this huge mirror that was basically the entire wall and was all fogged up from the hot shower, and on the lower right corner was the spot that my girlfriend wiped out to use. A little above the middle of the mirror was a handprint. Not just any ordinary handprint, but one that is as if someone was scratching against the damn thing, like a teacher would do to a blackboard when the class it noisy. So of course my heart froze and I stared at it for a full minute. ""Whatever"" I thought, I went on with my shower. After my shower, I went to get my cleanser, and when I came back, I looked at the print again and... it's even clearer. Which I guess makes sense because the rest of the mirror wasn't as fogged up as before. Proceed to meet my girlfriend for breakfast, and when we came back to get our bags, I went to look at the mirror again, and guess what? The fucking print was still there. ""How was it there? That's not possible!"" you might ask, and that was what I was thinking too, but you know how if you have soapy hands and wipe a window pane, you leave soap stains? Yeah, that's exactly what it looked like. I should've taken a picture, because I know this doesn't sound particularly convincing but I'm not here to convince anyone. You might think maybe my girlfriend played a prank on me but I highly doubt so, based on the way she reacted, and also the fact that the print was too high for her to reach (she's relatively small).

Fast forward a month later, I pretty much left all of that behind, thinking it was just that room in particular (and it probably was). Maybe it was bad luck or whatever, doesn't matter. Things were going swimmingly with my girlfriend and we went on a date at ECP (seriously, check my last comment, it was about asking what to do in that area). After a pretty long day, we were walking back from ECP via the underpass near Victoria School. I saw an abandoned scooter and pointed it out to my girlfriend right before the underpass, joking that it was a free scooter. After a while, we started talking about the scooter again, and somehow got the the topic of ""don't touch shit like this at night"". Which eventually led to me telling my girlfriend that the place near Victoria School was supposed to be an old Sook Ching site. Interesting bit of trivia, I thought, completely ignoring the fact that maaaaaaaybe you shouldn't talk about such stuff in the middle of the night. We take the bus, and sit all the way at the back of a double decker. Halfway throughout the bus ride, I see a fucking face in the window. Whatever, probably just the reflection, and shrug it off. Not three fucking minutes later, **my girlfriend said that she saw a face in the opposite window that I was looking at.** ""FUCK ME. ARE YOU SERIOUS"" goes through my mind, but I say nothing, not on the bus anyways. I was pretty shaken, and when we got off the bus, I had to chase the bus again because I left my wallet on the bus. So... we part ways at Tanah Merah, as that's where I live and I couldn't send her home because it was really late and she lives kinda far, so I go home on my own. Still mulling over it, I take the lift alone up to my floor. Spacing out and not focusing on anywhere in particular, I look at the plastic panes of the lift that was transparent. **Here's where it gets really fucked. Gradually, with each floor, the image of a person forms behind me. It was a mere shape of a person, and I couldn't make it out clear but I thought I saw a woman with long hair covering her face.** Well shit. Shit shit shit shit shit. Shit. What was I to do? I stayed calm, didn't make a pip, got home, washed my feet, said a prayer (I know no prayers) and went to bed. The next day, I told my girlfriend what happened and she was understandably freaked out. I did reassure her though, saying that it's probably nothing, and it does kinda work. She hasn't really experienced much of these events and was on the side of skepticism, and so was I.

**THAT'S NOT ALL. The next sequence of events happened two days after the ECP thing.** 

Today, or technically yesterday as it is the wee hours of morning right now, she went out with a friend. She came back relatively late, at around 12 AM, and we were texting while I was playing a bit of DotA after a run to keep my mind off the edge. It was a bad day, and I had a shit ton of bad luck. First I choked on a fish bone that I suspect is still inside, then at my part time job I somehow managed to shock myself with a display light's plug, then while on the way back on the bus I fell onto someone and finally halfway during the aforementioned run it started to rain. So yeah, some games while I wait for my laundry might help. My game was ending when suddenly I received a text from her saying ""Where you"". That's odd, I'm home, she should know that. I answered her that I'm home and asked her where she was. It took her awhile but she answered that she just got home, but she thought she saw me. ""What? No way, I'm home."" I thought, and replied her just that. Are you serious, she replied. Apparently, she saw someone looking just like me, with the same hair, the same clothes that I always wear, the same pair of slippers that I wear, sitting on the bench that I first sat on when I first waited for her at her place. What. The. Fuck. Ok, so maybe she remembered the clothes wrongly, and so I pulled out the clothes that matches her description and send her a picture of it. Yep, that's the shirt alright, she confirmed it. It was a dark blue shirt, one of my favourites that I always wear when going out with her. I then further probed her on what happened, and she told me that she saw someone that looked like me from afar, and thought that I was there to surprise her. She approached ""me"" but stopped at a distance, because she felt weird. For one, ""I"" was looking down, which wouldn't be the posture of a person waiting for someone. Because of that, she also couldn't see my face, and also, **""I"" had no fucking shadow.** She then decided to go back home first to put her stuff in place and text me to confirm where I am, which came about the conversation above.

After a bit of further conversation, I concluded that she saw a doppelganger of me, which is supposedly an ill omen for the person seeing it. I got her to wake her father up to pray for her, and now she's asleep. I have no idea what the fuck I'm supposed to feel, do, or react. I'm completely lost. I have never really experienced things like these before and all I know is that I'm starting to get really worried, both for her sake and mine. 

What should I do?

Edit: Woke up 4 hours after writing this. Girlfriend messaged me that she's running a high fever and that her dad drove her to the clinic

To clarify a few things, I'm not really worried about myself, in fact not at all, especially since I haven't been bothered much and that the only time I really saw something, it could be dismissed with me being tired, late at night with poor lighting. I do take my girlfriend seriously though, so when she started getting sick, it spurred me to write this long post. **So for all the skeptics out there**, I doubt my girlfriend is psychotic, and I have rationalized it out, and decided some alternative advise is what I se",GiveMeAu,I feel like shit

As you all know, the last meetup was ""great success"" and everyone had a damn good time!
I thought that before I leave you're lovely country at the end of the month, I would try and get a bunch of you guys together for another night of laughs,food and drinks -drunken stumbling on the beach is optional. I was thinking we could hit up Clarke Quay since there's tons of shit going on there and there are a couple of pretty sick bars (Se7en Inch and Crazy Elephant are sweet). If you have a better idea of a place to go,comment and let's get this discussion going :). I was thinking July 23rd (Saturday Night after 6-7pm), what do you guys and gals think?  
  
The options so far:   

[Wala Wala @ Holland Village](http://www.worldsbestbars.com/wala-wala-cafe-bar-in-singapore.htm)  
[Crazy Elephant @ Clarke Quay](http://www.crazyelephant.com/aboutus.html)  
[Se7en Inch @ Clarke Quay](http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/bars/se7en1nch)  
btw se7en inch is not as sleazy as that article makes it out to be....disappointingly :p  
  
**Update 1**: Seems to be a lot of love for Holland Village right now with 2 bars named, Wala Wala and now [Baden](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/baden_restaurant_pub/). Looks like this is shaping up to be some fun  
  
**Update 2**: Alright so far it looks like more people are into Holland Village for a meetup. It's a little more relaxed and doesn't have as much of a tourist trap feel. Plus it'll be good busy not mad rush busy like i'm assuming Clarke Quay will be. The bars will probably alternate between Baden and Wala Wala. They are [5 minutes apart on the same road](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=31+Lorong+Mambong,+277689&daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong,+277698&hl=en&ll=1.31174,103.794421&spn=0.001456,0.002642&sll=1.31175,103.794405&sspn=0.001456,0.002642&geocode=FbEDFAAd7MYvBikRgeiVaxraMTH9M6ZJgog47g%3BFZgEFAAdJscvBiGB7WF_My68Bg&mra=ls&dirflg=w&z=19) so it's a non issue. Baden is a bit of a quieter less expensive hangout joint, and wala wala has higher prices overall but also provides for a second level with a live band. What's the general preference? Post comments. For the record i'd ideally like to start at baden and abuse their happy hour and then see where the rowdy reddit crowd will want to go afterwards. Thoughts?  
  
**FINAL UPDATE:** Hey guys. So it's decided that this shindig is going down at Holland Village. For your convenience, [**here are some directions**](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=Buona+Vista+Mrt+Station+North+Buona+Vista+Road&daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong&hl=en&ll=1.30919,103.79179&spn=0.005824,0.010568&sll=1.308793,103.792262&sspn=0.005824,0.010568&geocode=FdrzEwAda7IvBiElGrU3lFMJew%3BFYIEFAAdyMYvBilDkAyUaxraMTHsMM73UF_Pzw&gl=sg&mra=ls&dirflg=r&ttype=now&noexp=0&noal=0&sort=def&z=17&start=0) from the Buona Vista MRT station to The Baden and Wala Wala Cafe. It is pretty straightforward.  
  
I'm aiming to be at Baden at 7pm (i'll be on time, this time I swear) and I'll see if we can get some space to ourselves while people come in. After everyone's there we can sorta decide on what people would like to get up to. I hope that gels with you guys. As always, I'm more than happy to help redditors out with queries/questions/need directions etc. so just PM me and i'll give you my contact details. Looking forward to a good night out!! :D

So I will be arriving in changi on the 21st at 10pm, and I will most likely stay at the airport overnight since my room won’t be ready until the 22nd. Couple of questions:

1. I heard that once I land I would need to go through immigration first, claim my luggage and then go through customs. But I heard that the rest area (sleeping chair/bed) is inside the terminal so once I claim my luggage and go through customs I won’t be able to go back in. Is this true?

2. I’m bringing 2 luggage (not exceeding 25kg each) and 1 carry on. In the luggage contains a shit ton of American snacks and 1liter of whiskey, couple of baby meds my friend requested, 5 pills of Xanax for anxiety, 1 strip of zzzquil and one bottle of my own meds, 1 small manchego cheese and 2 packs of small guanciale meat and one pack of cigs. Will this get me fined or worse, jail?

&#x200B;

Her grades weren't that good but she's constantly trying to improve herself by taking notes during class and studying individually at home. She's working hard but what does this education system do to ""reward"" her efforts?  


Every time she improves herself, the teachers just raise the bar higher and find more things to scold her for. It makes her feel worthless as no matter what she does, it is as though she is the worst of the worst and good for nothing.

&#x200B;

It creates this illusion that she is never good and no matter what you do you are still the worst - despite the fact that she is getting better and better academically.

&#x200B;

Her mother had fallen into this trick that her school has pulled on her and now believes that she is a horrible daughter.

&#x200B;

""When my mom fights with me, she locks herself in her room afterwards and cry about how horrible of a daughter I am."" my friend said. There's really nothing for her mother to feel depressed about but because of the lies and deception that goes on between the teachers and her, she gained a very biased and untrue impression of her own daughter.

So now my friend is in this terrible helpless state where no one trusts her because of this disgusting mind trick that the school has pulled on her mother. Everywhere my friend goes she gets criticized and blamed and life for her is pretty much hell now.

I was born with around 30% worse hearing than normal and had to wear hearing aids since small. Because of something like this, I was often bullied and outcast in primary and secondary school. As a result, I developed depression and anxiety and dropped out of secondary school right before N-levels in 2014 to try and focus on an online IT business I had for a while.

Things didn't go well however and we closed in 2015. After that it was a roller coaster of finding a job that suited me, it wasn't that bad until I failed my probation for a job in the IT industry I really wanted, and I have been searching for a job since. A few months after failing my probation, my hearing got worse all of a sudden, with my left ear having around 40% hearing capability and my right having gone almost 100% deaf.

This severely limited the number of job options I had in the IT industry as I have poor hearing, and my highest qualification is PSLE. While I do have a few years of IT and customer service experience, it doesn't help much especially in a country like Singapore.

I really don't know what to do anymore, I feel bloody lost and helpless and a burden to my parents, especially my father. All I wanted was a job in the IT industry while studying part time and helping my family with finances, yet I just can't seem to have any luck.

Perhaps it's better if I just end things so my fam will have one less mouth to feed? I feel so bloody tired just living because of all these worries.

What should I do about my girlfriend cutting?,9,3kze30,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3kze30/what_should_i_do_about_my_girlfriend_cutting/,20,2015-09-15 16:48:26,"Hi all, I've been a lurker for a while now, and given the great advice I've seen others receive in this community, I thought it'd do me some good to listen to what you all think about a problem I'm currently facing. Pardon my English, I'm not as well spoken as you all here, and frankly my thoughts are in a mess.

Some background info: I've known my current girlfriend for more than a year, and we are really close. We meet at least once every two days, we've met each other's parents, and in general, we are just really honest and direct with one another. 

She used to be in a relationship, but as young immature boys are, her boyfriend lost interest in her and they broke up. She became depressed and cut herself. All these happened prior to me getting to know her, but I trust her 100% about what and why it happened. She had recovered by the time I met her, although now and then she feels depressed at night, but she always feels better the following day. She has not inflicted self harm since as well. (I truly trust her on this as we are completely honest with one another)

Then, last weekend, we had an argument, resulting in her leaving to go home. Over text, she told me she basically felt as if I loved myself more than her. I don't know whether it's true or not, but her reasoning behind it was ridiculous, so I felt really offended and mentioned that if she feels that way, perhaps it may be better if she found someone else. I didn't want things to end with her, but the feeling of being accused of not loving someone when you do makes you so helpless and inadequate.

We sorted things out, and I found out that she bought a blade to cut herself when I brought up the idea that perhaps it's better we don't be together. At this point, I am completely overwhelmed with rage and despair. She sent me a picture of her cuts, and while they were not likely to leave scars, the very fact it's self induced drives me crazy. I am unable to respond to her with the amount of patience and understanding I know I should have; all I feel is anger, as if she took the easy way out in dealing with emotional pain in a relationship. She told me it wasn't because of me that she cut herself, but because of her own need to ""distract herself"". That still doesn't change the fact she was able to abstain from self harm for over a year, and returned to it because we argued.

Looking advice up on Google gives me info applicable in a different context. Most sites teach you how to bring up the topic to a friend who is a habitual cutter. For me, I have no issues bringing it up, I just don't know what to say, what to feel or what to do. Also, she isn't a habitual cutter, she only cut when we argued. I'm so sorry for the long post guys, but I'm really lost because I have no one to turn to. Any sincere advice is appreciated, thank you in advance.

Edit: Also, I don't want to have to worry about her cutting herself whenever we argue. It'll make me give in to her all the time for fear she'll do something to herself, and I don't think that is good for a successful long term relationship. As a person who suffers from anxiety, I really can't handle the idea that she may be hurting herself, it's a extremely horrible feeli",help-me-understand,I feel helpless

psychiatric help?,12,215yvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/215yvd/psychiatric_help/,13,2014-03-24 10:45:29,"Hey guys,

I was wondering if anyone here has sought psychiatric help before? And how much it costs?

Reason I'm asking is that several people I know have mentioned that I should seek professional help. I've been going through a long period of flipping between being so happy, and then just crashing down so hard a few hours. The downs last far longer than the ups, and the longer I stew in that, the worse my mood becomes, to the point of going through thoughts of suicide.

I'm so scared of myself. I don't actually know how to talk to someone face-to-face, which I've tried at a counselling session long ago. I just froze -__- I would really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. Cost is a big issue for me, as I don't earn a lot (just enough to survive on this sunny little island), and taking time off from work will mean that I don't get paid.

Singapore versus Hong Kong,335,94h4pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/94h4pd/singapore_versus_hong_kong/,219,2018-08-04 22:27:31,"Singaporean living and working in HK for the last 4 years. 
Lurking on the r/Singapore and r/Hongkong subreddits. 


Once HKers invariably find out that I'm from Singapore or Singaporeans find out I live and work in HK, the inevitable question is: do you like Singapore more or HK more? 


I just want to qualify that I love both places. Singapore is home. But each place has its pros and cons. 

This isn't an exhaustive list, but it's something I have at hand when I talk to people.

1. Property prices and sizes. Singaporeans always complain about property prices, but HKers will just laugh. HDB has done an amazing job of ensuring that most Singaporeans will be able to have a flat more than double the size of a Hong Konger at a third of the price. 

2. Food. Forget about Michelin stars and gourmet food in HK. Yeah, great food, Hong kongers get to eat goose and amazing dai pai dong food and better seafood, but Singaporean food culture wins hands down. Better street food culture in the hawker centers, more variety with Malay and peranakan food, more spice, more flavour, more intensity and vibrancy. That said, HK isn't too far behind.

3. Sovereignty. Singaporeans have a sense of nationalistic pride and assurance that our country is our country. Hong kongers will always have a cloud hanging over them: I expect this to get worse in thirty years. Big brother over the border is watching.

4. Vibrancy and character. Hong Kong wins hands down. Less government regulation, more freedom to do whatever you want, people are less afraid to be creative. There's more energy on the streets, a sense of urgency and a pulse that races faster than Singapore. The neon lights of Hong Kong, the old, delapidated buildings add to the noir charm. The cleanliness and blandness of Singapore is boring in comparison.

5. Crime. Singapore has far less crime. Drugs, sex and violence here are much more common, more shootings, gang warfare, triads, etc. Adds to the character of the city but also not the safest place.

6. Schooling. Not Joseph schooling, but in terms of education Singapore provides a lot more for a lot less. People always complain about the stress levels in Singapore but in HK you start interviewing for good schools when you're 2 yrs old. It's absolute madness. International schools and private schools cost a bomb.

7.  Scenery. HK is way more scenic than Singapore. So much more nature, national parks, hiking trails, waterfalls, mountains, real beaches, coast lines. People die from getting lost in the mountains. 

8. Climate. People in HK complain about the hot and humid summers: but it's like that in Singapore all year round. At least you get winter, autumn and spring in HK. With that comes typhoons and killer storms.

9. Health care. So what that Singapore is a hub for medical tourism. The health care is nearly completely free in HK, for HK residents. You can get major heart surgery here and stay in the intensive care unit for months and only have to pay a token sum. Major medical issues aren't going to bankrupt you.

10. Location. Weekend trips to Japan or taiwan, or even Shanghai. A lot more convenient from HK than it is from Singapore.

11. Public transport. MTR beats MRT. Faster, more reliable, larger volume, cheaper. Cars are also much cheaper in Hong Kong.

In summary, both places rock and I'm blessed to have lived in both places. Don't make me pick a place",ty_xy,I want to die

Z: Europeans like to put themselves through hardship voluntarily (unlike Singaporeans). Westerners suffer a lot of problems like having parents who die from drug addiction ... blah blah blah... goes on to talk about how much more ""hardship"" the Westerners have to go through and how sheltered we snowflakes are.

Z: I will give my son (who will be born in Sg) the choice to choose if he wants to stay and serve NS or go back to Europe.

Z: NS is a consequence of being born in Sg. Its just like people who are being born in a poor country where the consequence is high chance of poverty and starvation. (Your son somehow gets to choose :) )

Do we have someone like Dr Toh in today’s cabinet?,51,8wash3,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8wash3/do_we_have_someone_like_dr_toh_in_todays_cabinet/,37,2018-07-06 06:18:19,"
Dr Toh Chin Chye: Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe, as a senior citizen, I am qualified to say a few words on the CPF.
The Member for Kebun Baru has given an exposition from the viewpoint of the NTUC, and I do not wish to cover the ground that he has already made. There is no doubt that we should be aware that there will be a problem of the aged in the years to come, whether in the year 1990 or the year 2000. But it is important, therefore, that we should try to divorce a proposition that has been put forward by the Minister for Health, trying to explain to us what the size of this problem will be and the means to solve this problem. Unfortunately, the Report of this Committee on the Problems of the Aged has tried to solve this complex problem by touching on the Central Provident Fund as if that were the only solution, very much the way that the Minister for Health went about trying to solve the problems of the sick by using Medisave and taking off 6% from the CPF to collect monies which is spent by patients in the hospitals.
The reason for all this uneasiness on the problems of the aged is related to the CPF. The problems of the aged have been forgotten because you are touching people's savings. I related in the debate on Medisave how the Government could cover the cost of the entire operations of the Ministry of Health from revenue earned by the Ministry of Health plus the 2% payroll tax, without touching on savings. You have created a precedent. You have touched savings for Medisave. I abstained from the vote. Others have agreed. So the Minister for Health says, ""Well, I have got one nut. Now I can get two nuts. How do I solve the problems of the aged? There was no great opposition to touching the CPF. Now I shall solve the problems of the aged by dipping into the CPF.""
But here, he came across a hornets' nest. It is because, Mr Speaker, the problem is that those who attempt to seek a solution to the problems of the aged are civil servants who draw pensions to which they do not pay anything. They get a gratuity, two-thirds, and pension, one-third. So it is quite easy then to handle other people's problems by touching their savings. Pensions do not come from savings. Supposing, if we did convert the entire cost of running the civil service on taxes and savings, I believe you would have a different report today.
There are many countries that are facing this problem. It is not unique in Singapore. No political problem is new for Singapore. And this is a problem that has been encountered by bigger societies and bigger economies than ours. They have employed devious ways of how to allow those who are ageing to retire gracefully and in security without becoming a pauper. Why, in America, there is even a scheme in the private sector which permits a retiree to donate his entire savings to a company and he is posted to a village where he can retire until he dies. That is a very expensive village. It is not meant for those with small CPF savings.
This problem of touching the CPF should be related to the use of the CPF, the management of the CPF and the contribution of CPF. I have repeated, time and again, that the CPF, having risen now to 50% of wages, is becoming a vexatious burden, not only to the employee but also to the employer. The employer is now paying 25% of salary towards the CPF, plus 2% payroll tax, plus 4% Skills Development Fund. That makes 31% cost on payroll alone. Of course, if there is an increase in salary from NWC recommendations, all these taxes go up. The burden on the employee is that his take-home pay becomes less, and since his take-home pay becomes less it is an issue for union bargaining, (house-unions now) to bargain with the employer for more pay.
The Minister for Finance is extremely concerned with the amount of money being locked into CPF, reducing the liquidity in commercial banks. I think that is a very genuine concern which, as the Minister for Finance, he ought to be very worried out. He should not allow his Minister for Health to dip into the CPF or to increase the CPF, because this is a social problem that is popping up. It must be thought out in breadth. We must have a vision which encompasses breadth. Do not have tunnel vision. I would like to know that we have got telescopic vision. But, Mr Speaker, I have never had the problem of tunnel vision, and that is, looking at a problem along just one line without bothering, or researching in depth, the impact on other areas.
Let us look at the problem in general. Over the last five years, 1979 to 1983, an average of 8.4% only has been withdrawn from the balance due to members who contribute to the CPF. Only 8.4%, that is if they retire at 55. I would like to put this question to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Labour who is responsible for administering the CPF. What would this percentage be if the withdrawal age were raised to 60 or 65? Of this amount that was withdrawn, two-thirds were spent on buying houses, mainly HDB flats. So only one-third was spent on retirement. In 1983, $1,718 million were withdrawn but only $374 million were spent on retirement.
So the problem we should ask ourselves is this. As the deposit in the CPF grows and grows, our balances in the CPF will grow, and when we withdraw that sum of money, will we suddenly have overnight millionaires as retirees? How many of them are there? Will it generate inflation? I do not think it will be, because if two-thirds of the balance are withdrawn for purchasing houses and only one-third for retirement, therefore it is less of a concern that raising the age to 60 or 65 will mean that we will be controlling consumption by the private sector. What is irksome is this: that the Government is using people's savings and telling them how to spend their savings. That is the nub of the problem.
I think everybody recognizes there is a problem for the aged. The Minister for Health says so. Only they do not believe in his methods of solving this problem. There are homes for the aged. I have a kongsi for the aged. One of my members who was a worker in the PSA had withdrawn hisCPF, but it was so small that even if he were to spend $100 a month, it would have vanished in three years. It was that small. This was the reason why he is living in my kongsi for the aged.
We need to clearly define the boundaries within which the CPF will be used for retirement. We must spell that out. You just cannot say, ""Let us raise the withdrawal age to 60 or 65."" It must be 60. It must be 65. Now, at which age? This Paper does not contain any calculation at all to say what will happen if it is withdrawn at 60, or what will happen if it is withdrawn at 65. If I were a person who has no relatives, if I were a widower with no children, all the assumptions made by this Committee - that you will be looked after by your children - then I do not qualify under any of these grounds. The statistics show very clearly that 43% of your senior citizens preferred to live with son and daughter-in-law and only 12% with daughter and son-in-law. But we are at the same time pursuing a family planning campaign. So if you have two daughters, you had it. Your chances are reduced to 12%. So do you understand now why the Chinese persist in having a son?
Mr Speaker, I think fundamental principles are being breached. The fundamental principle is this. The CPF is really a fixed deposit or a loan to Government, which can be redeemed at a fixed date when the contributor is 55 years old. If I were to put this sum of money in a commercial bank and, on the due date I go to the bank to withdraw the money, the manager says, ""i am sorry, Dr Toh, you will have to come next year"", there will be a run on the bank! It is as simple as this, that the CPF has lost its credibility, the management of it. This is fundamental. You were taken by surprise by Medisave. Then they say, ""6% of your Special Account will be kept for Medisave and you cannot withdraw that, even if you were to die.""
Now I ask the Minister for Health, and I asked him last time, whether his word is binding on future Ministers. Neither will the Minister for Labour's word be binding on future Ministers for Labour. Can any Government or any Minister guarantee that in future years a law will not be passed that will say, ""All Special Accounts in the CPF cannot be withdrawn until you die""? Your Special Account now is up to 10%; 6% Medisave, 4% for what? So unless you use the CPF to buy property, your money is in real danger of being kept under lock and key by others, not under your own lock and key. This is the nub of the problem - the credibility of the management, gradual encroachment into the purpose of the CPF which was instituted really to provide for retirement.
Again, there are many permutations on how people retire. Assuming that the CPF is like a vast insurance company, and then it hands out an annuity. I am old. It may well be that at 60 or 65 I am no longer employable. I may be senile, nobody may want to employ me. So the argument of the Member for Kebun Baru is weak there. It does not mean that employers, by just raising the retirement age to 60 or 65, will find that there will be increased productivity. The man may be a menace to the company! There are many of them in Woodbridge Hospital. I am not really convinced on that score.
You have, again, other types of contributors to the CPF. You have got expatriate workers, you have got Malaysian workers. Nowhere in this Paper is it spelt out what will be the fate of the balances of expatriate and Malaysian guest workers. Will Malaysian workers, who are now eligible to withdraw at 50 and 55 years old, be affected if, assuming today, we agree that the withdrawal age will be raised to 60 or 65? I think your mind must be applied to see the problem as a whole, and how this problem affects others. The aged guest workers are not going to stay here. So let them take their money when they go home. If that is permissible for expatriate workers, why should it not be permissible for your own workers? That is where I see the contradiction in the management of the CPF.
I am not against the Minister for Health spelling out future problems, but I would like to ask him, ""Is it true, really, looking at these statistics, the dependency ratio is so many percent?"" Does that mean that the Government is really supporting all these aged? On the one hand you say, ""No, no, it is the family members who are supporting the aged parents."" So where does the CPF come into play? This is why this document - it should be a green paper, not a blue paper - would have been better if minds had been applied to the whole problem, so that we are set at ease about your thinking. Or are you trying another fast one?
Mr Speaker, as a senior citizen, I am beyond the decision of the Committee whether my withdrawal age should be 60 or 65.
Mr Howe Yoon Chong (Minster of Health): You have already withdrawn yours?
Dr Toh Chin Chye: I have withdrawn mine. But in fairness to my constituents and to others who have not yet reached this age, I ask ""Do you wish me to speak, or do you wish me to be dumb?"" They say, they are against this. So I have to explain to them the problems that they will be facing and, most importantly, some of them tell me this. They are not going to squander their money on world-wide trips to see Mickey Mouse in Disneyland. Some married late. By the time they retire at 55, their children are due to go to junior college or the university. Many of them are banking on this sum of money to cover the cost of their children's higher education.
Some hon. Members: Hear! hear!
Dr Toh Chin Chye: If you say they cannot withdraw until 60 or 65, their children had it. It is as simple as that. With these words, Mr Speaker, I pass the debate to abler Members of the House. [Applau",ArchaeologicalTab,I want to die

What would you want for Singapore to TRULY reach the [Smart Nation] goal?,97,7j9kn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7j9kn2/what_would_you_want_for_singapore_to_truly_reach/,57,2017-12-13 01:22:43,"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-is-already-a-smart-nation-govtech-minister-says-9481988

So this dear minister here says that our nation has already reached the level of being one. But the comments across the internet speak otherwise. Drawing from some of those points:

- Continue to open up specific sections of our infrastructure as APIs to select companies/startups. Such as our live traffic cam footage, banking services, etc. It would be nice to say have apps that can manage our finances from multiple banks here, or to have an app that can tell me the traffic situation ahead of me, or tell me how much parking is available in certain areas. Make it even a paid API access, monetize it for all i care, just give access. We have IOT sensors all over our country says Dr Janil, then where are the APIs that let developers access this. Don't just give access to DSO and IDA.

- Test beds for specific applications - Self driving, drone mapping etc. Like those that are in Pittsburgh, or in California. It's sad to see our self driving startup scene, go away from our shores (Nutonomy). Actually have a specific test bed area with traffic lights and all, say at one north for companies to come in and test self-driving tech. Singapore CAN afford to do this.

- Actually teach industry relevant cutting edge tech in universities. Or at least have it as a small section of our cirriculum. PLC (Used in SMRT), ABB Controllers (Used in Automation and Baggage Handling). Many of these things I had to learn on the job after graduation.

- Actually have the ability to pay NOT via cash, but through QR Codes. The SMS transfer thing does not really work vendor to consumer. Things like GrabPay seem to solving this, but are hardly available nationwide. 

- Actually take research from ""research"" to commercialization. Too many research products here get shown in the media, only to disappear to another country when the researcher (if not local) leaves. Allow the public to track such research projects, especially if they are funded by tax payer money. It's honestly hard for an outsider to see what new research is going on in molecular biology or self-driving tech.

- Make the government a bit more open for gods sake. For example, in USA, there is a website called congress.gov and a channel called cspan, that lets you track individual bill statuses, and even lets you see a semi-televised view of what happens in congress. People can't get involved in politics if we have no idea what happens in doors. And we have no idea what is at the table for discussion as well.

- Improve our last mile problem! It's still a nightmare to get from the MRT to whereever. The MRT was working great until recently too (but we hope itll get fixed by next year). Footpaths all over Singapore are extremely small and in poor condition. Widen them, make it easy for e-scooters or e-bikes to be viable options. Expand the park connectors in the heartlands. There are certainly spaces where this can be done. Buses are just too slow during rush hour.

- More technology driven shopping. Why is it that NTUC and Cold Storage still looking the same from 20 years ago. In the Bay Area, there are many interesting things like being able to look up your position in the aisle, searching for the things you want and even apps that tell you how to find your things. Isn't our retail scene suppose to be big. Have more innovation there! 

- NLB. I can't rent cool things like guitars, or musical instrument, or game CDs unless it's at certain special branches. We have no easy way of accessing very old footage or articles from the past for school projects. We don't have interesting classes, such as comic drawing, or language learning, or programming classes.

- Our CCS. Are for old people. For old almost going to die people. We need to revamp our CCs to be more interesting for youth. Have better study spaces, swimming pools, street soccer courts, jamming or music studios, pool table and gyms that dont cost 6 dollars an entry, mma classes, tennis or squash courts. something interesting. Most CCs especially in the east have none of these facilities. Have courses like DJing, Ardunio classes, wood working / building classes etc. Things that youth might enjoy doing. This is quite off my point of Smart Nation, but still partly applies.

- Fix the dam MRT Info screen. It's shit. Why am I still struggling to figure out what station I'm arriving at underground after all these years.

- Have more televised shows that allow the youth, or people of Singapore to interact with it's leaders, and ask serious, or at least even curated questions. Don't understand why I don't see more of this. It's a hall mark of a democratic country and once again involves us in the political agenda and it's processes.

Smart Nation is more than just creating more/better e-services for its citizens. We've done a pretty darn good job at that, and it's now time to move beyond ",soulslicer0,I want to die

***
“Fall in!” came the cry and Ah Boy did, whereby his platoon sedia, and lep, lep, lep-right’d to the Tekong cookhouse. A crowd was there already; if only his platoon’s blur cock had not forgotten his bottle, water parade would have gone by much faster and everyone would have been early for their indented welfare.

Amidst the queues, a specky caught Ah Boy’s eye — he had the brightest smile Ah Boy’s ever seen. Ah Boy gabra one second. Specky was chatting with his buddies while waiting to scan his 11B, and Ah Boy could only eye power. He thought Specky looked quite garang, despite the SAF-approved black framed glasses and being a fellow botak.

BEEPBEEPBEEP! went the machine as Ah Boy realised he inserted his 11B the wrong way. The 3SG stormed over.

“OI RECRUIT! What you doing?” he demanded, and scanned Ah Boy’s 11B for him and selecting “Excellent” on the prompted survey.

Ah Boy wasn’t quite concerned as the servers plopped a dome-shaped serving of “carrot cake” on to his plate. He had an objective, and recce’d his way over to where Specky was seated.

“Hi, the table where my platoon is seated is full, can I sit here?” Ah Boy asked Specky.

“Sure! Join us!” Specky replied.

Ah Boy was briefed that Specky’s name was Richard Chao and that they were in the same COY, but adjacent platoons. The table suddenly was on high alert as the Pegasus COY recruits came into the cookhouse but Ah Boy had little interest in the ops briefing with the fellow smelly recruits at the table about the girls.

Mealtime was over and over the course of BMT, Ah Boy learned loyalty to country, leadership, discipline, professionalism, ethics, fighting spirit and above all, to care for soldiers. Ah Boy and REC Chao hit it off well.

POP arrived before anyone knew it. That day was filled with cheer. “POP lo!” rang through the halls. But for Ah Boy, it was CAT 1 in his mind. “Alright, don’t cock up, or else you will die cock stand,” he thought. It was admin time and Ah Boy felt like Pikachu as he walked down the floor to talk to REC Chao.

“Hey,” Ah Boy said, as REC Chao was kiwi-ing his boots for his Smartest 4.

“Hey,” responded REC Chao. This was worse than chiong sua at SIT-TEST, thought Ah Boy.

“So, I just want to say thanks for stopping the encik from stunning my wife the other day,” started Ah Boy. But he didn’t get very far because the rest of REC Chao’s bunk ambushed Chao with a blanket party. Ah Boy lost his balls and left.    
——    
“Wake up your idea la,” Ah Boy thought to himself. It couldn’t be. He thought he spotted a familiar specky along the guardhouse corridors. Ah Boy was freshly posted to the camp out of OCS, when he kena arrowed to be IC for that weekend’s guard duty. Then he saw it: on the roster was the name “PTE RICHARD CHAO”.

“KNN,” Ah Boy thought as drew in a sharp breath. He erased the patrol partner of PTE Chao and put his name in. When it was patrol time, Ah Boy led the routine rotan-and-shield wayang, and then paired up with PTE Chao for the patrol.

“Sir!” beamed PTE Chao at 2LT Ah Boy.

As they walked, Ah Boy’s heart dropped 20 and he wondered if he had to go see the MO for an Attend C. No camo stick could disguise the red that was rising on his cheeks; if only he had a CB leaf to hide behind. He needed to finish that conversation he started back at BMT but never got to finish.

“PTE Chao, this is a no duff question so listen up.”

“Yes sir?”

“Next weekend, when we bookout, you want to go R&R with me before we book in?” Ah Boy asked PTE Chao.

“I think…” PTE Chao started to reply.

“You think, I thought, who confirm?” Ah Boy said. Both laughed tactically in the darkness of the camp as they balonglong through their guard duty patrol route.

“Roger,” PTE Chao said. “What do you want to do?” he asked Ah Boy.

“Lim zui hou?” suggested Ah Boy.

“Hou. But can we make it back before 2359?” PTE Chao queried. “I don’t want to sign any more extra, you know. That’s how I kena tonight’s saikang.”

“It’s ok,” assured Ah Boy. “You can hide behind my occifer smoke.”

PTE Chao smiled, and both walked in radio silence between them for another half-click.

“You know I’m willing to stand by universe for you,” Ah Boy said.

PTE Chao smiled. “Me too.”

Hi! The last time I posted anything, it was a short update on the daily thread that I'd moved to my dad's house.

I'm pretty fortunate compared to anyone who might find themselves in a situation like mine; somehow I've been lucky enough to get a scholarship that not only covers my university tuition fees and accommodation, but gives me a monthly allowance on top of that. So I've only lived with my dad for a short while, and I now have my ""own"" place (staying in a hall in uni) where I am pretty comfortable and happy. :)

It's been almost 6 months since I've left home, and I do not regret a single day since I've made that decision. Occasionally though, I will start to think of my mum and question if I should attempt to reconcile with her. However, thoughts of her abusive words and actions never fail to make me die a little more inside, and thinking just of the state of her house makes me shut down all thoughts of reconciliation.

While she has always doted on my brother more than me, he doesn't do as well as me academically and I fear that she will soon put immense pressure on him since he's taking his O levels next year. Reading the post about the teenage suicide rate being the highest in 15 years sent a chill down my spine as I have ever thought of suicide, and, while I want to believe otherwise, I'm fairly certain my brother has as well. Not only is my mum a hoarder, the amount of pressure she puts on me academically is really quite interesting (e.g. I got 262 for PSLE– it wasn't enough for her as I was brought home and very very harshly reprimanded and then made to feel ashamed of myself for at least a whole year after that).

And while the idea that academic success isn't all that matters have somehow started to dawn on her seeing my brother not do as well as I did for PSLE, she continues to pressure him by sending him for not only tuition but instrument classes for 2 INSTRUMENTS as well. My brother was one of the main reasons holding me back from suicide, and I cannot find it in me to see him be put under all this unnecessary pressure without doing anything to help him. He's ever told me he's very stressed because of my mum and then broke down in front of me. It breaks my heart as an older sister.

I want to help him eventually find a way out of that hellhole too, but one thing's stopping me– what will my mum do?

She has been unemployed ever since I was born (I'm 19), and most of her life has revolved around taking care of her children (and also her late mother) from then on. I now know this is not really the norm, but she receives quite a lot of alimony from my dad (it's quite a few K) and hasn't actually *needed* to work. Yet she tries to earn passive income, and consequently has been involved in, I kid you not, at least 5 MLM schemes. Obviously, none of them succeeded in making her a billionaire and honestly have probably made us poorer. lol

Right now, other than presumably taking care of my brother (I wouldn't quite know, haven't exactly spoken to her in 6 months...) she spends a LOT of her time involved in church activities. But other than that, I don't know what she's doing with her time. Probably making jewellery that she'll never sell (I'm not trying to be a smartass here. This is a very factual statement.) or watching TV. 

If I ever one day help my brother away from her, I really don't know what she will do. If she can text me things like ""I wanted to jump down the 16th floor when I found out your dad had another woman 10 years ago, but I didn't because I had two young kids. I think now is the time."" after I'd left the house, can you imagine the possibility of her actually following through those words when her other child leaves as well?

I don't really know what I can, or *should* do. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice. For those that have followed my story since the start, thank you for your support over the past year. ",sgthrowaway_1,I want to die
Need help protecting myself/ignore,88,4rq82j,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4rq82j/need_help_protecting_myselfignore/,40,2016-07-08 10:47:46,"Hi all. I am a JC dropout and am currently waiting for NS. For the past 2 years my sister, in her early twenties, has been routinely shouting at me and my father almost every other day at the top of her voice. Some days it's laughable nonsense: the other day she was shouting about how she believed in Black Magic and that there were people out there who were using it to make sure her life was ruined. But most days, she keeps shouting about how me and my Dad are ""OPPRESSING"" her and that we are MALE PIGS WHO WANT TO RUIN HER LIFE.

Over the last 6 months she has made 2 police reports against me, claiming that I am harassing and physically abusing her. I have done no such thing. I have not even spoken to her in 3 months, since she made the 2nd report. The police have not followed up on the reports.

She suffered from OCD for a few years way back. But she received treatment for it and has recovered. But in place, a demon has taken over. A demon that won't stop shouting, won't stop just stop fucking shouting and screaming and banging the doors

Today, she accused me of raping her and threw a glass at my father's head. And I think she has made the third report. I don't know what to do. My father has been suffering from depression for the past 2 years and yet this cunt won't leave him in peace. He doesn't beat her, doesn't do anything. All he does is watch TV after getting home from work. And she can't even let him do that. We are not well off; my father doesn't have a good education, and she taunts him for it everyday, cursing him for not having enough money to pay for her diploma (despite the fact that he helped her get admission), for being a loser and a failure, and not buying her new things ""like all her friends""...And it goes on and on...Any attempt to talk rationally to her is useless. Any.

Please advise on how to protect myself. I have made some sound recordings of her hurling abuse at me and my father, but that's probably about as far as I can go in capturing evidence without further provoking her. 

It's only been getting worse over the last few months. I think it's been affecting my mental health as well. I can't concentrate on working and learning things while there's a monster in my house who shouts at the top of her lungs every single day. I don't know. I don't feel like doing anything.

At one point I didn't even leave the house for 2 weeks, sleeping 14 hours a day. My diet consists of instant noodles and $1 donuts and . I've thought a lot about leaving this house, but where would I go. No money, no job, no nothing except my maybe declining mental health and some books lying around and the love of movies to keep me from opening my veins. I wish this cunt would just die, I really do. I don't know. She told me she would spit on my grave when I die and wouldn't shed a single tear. I told her the feeling is mutual. She proceeded to lunge at me. She says she's sworn on her grave to make my life a living hell, to ruin any dreams and endeavors in life that I wish to undertake. Toxic. I don't know. I have no one to talk to IRL; no shoulder to rest my head on; no one who really loves me, not even my own mother. I'm learning to come to terms with my crippling loneliness. But some days, like on this one, it becomes unbearable. Feel free to report this off and ignore it. I just needed to get it off my chest.

It's now 2 am, she just started again. By hurling a textbook on my sleeping father. Another hour of routine shouting. Come to think of it, I'm probably just as flawed as she is. I don't kno",childrenofkingsman,I want to die

It could not fly as it had trouble even walking and I figured it was a baby bird as parents force their offspring to fly after birth.

What is your view on racism and culturalism in Singapore?,0,67o5mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/67o5mk/what_is_your_view_on_racism_and_culturalism_in/,9,2017-04-27 05:35:54,"The racism in Europe, Canada, and Australia, barely extends to more than those towards Muslims and Blacks. You never hear about racism against Indians in the same way you get racism against Muslim and Blacks.

We usually get stereotyped as ""the good people"" and the ""friends of white nationalists"".

Muslims get a lot of racism in the West, but Muslims also have more problems with integration than they do in Singapore (religion can be a strong drive to segregate oneself, and Europeans never forcibly told them that it was wrong not to integrate due to the liberal values); once the ideological problems are sorted out, I think racism will die down.

I would also say that colorism wasn't a major issue in the West, but recently we've seen a lot of colorism and racism [and sexual racism] in the media against Indians; there are more Indians in Singaporean media, and discussion about colorism against Indians is more vibrant.

But one thing I love about Singapore is the ability to keep our culture and links with our homelands; people here just don't care if you spend most of your time speaking to Chinese friends on in Mandirin, or spend all your time on r/india. It's possible to be really diverse and have a variety of political viewpoints, and yet still live among each other in peace.

I don't think there is anywhere else where one can be so openly connected with both one's religion and one's homeland, without being told that you're weird, or losing all your friends. I don't think that it's acceptable to be openly into a non-western ideology (e.g. Confucianism or Hinduism) in western countries, nor do I think that living on a diet of non-western media would make you any friends with westerners.

And we don't have identity politics in Singapore. We don't have the idea that Indians are right-wing and Blacks are left-wing (as in Australia or Canada), and we don't bring religion into politics too much.

The assimilation that Singapore practices is far better than the assimilation practiced in the West. It means that everyone gets along yet gets to do what they want - a more practical form of freed",deccanprogressive,I want to die
Daughter of a hoarder.,63,3oqafn,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/,60,2015-10-15 06:56:45,"Hi /r/singapore. Throwaway because I want to ask for some family advice and I think my classmates know my main account but not of my situation. Also, I'm posting this not in /r/relationships or whatever because I don't think a lot of people from other countries will understand that I can't just move out when I'm 18. Maybe I will after this, idk yet see how.

Very long post warning.

I'm a 17F living with my mum and brother in a condo in the east, currently in a certain IP school. Background of my family is that my dad left the house one day in 2010 after many years of arguments and unhappiness with my mum, and they got their divorce finalised in 2011. 'Many years' cos she found out he was having an affair in 2002, right before my brother was born. The affair continued til around 2013, I think my dad now has a new woman but idk and this is deviating from my main issue.

One of the main things that my parents argued over was that my mum had too much stuff and my dad couldn't stand it. He would ask her to throw away things and she would get emotional saying that he was intruding into her personal space. As a child, I wouldn't understand their arguments and I would always side with my mum as I hated my dad for having an affair. He would coop himself up in his bedroom (my mum slept in the same room as my bro and I) saying that he didn't like to see the mess outside, get angry at her for buying new books (will elaborate later), clean up and throw away some of the stuff she bought while my mum brought us children out, take pictures of my mum's stuff as 'evidence' for her hoarding, and I would always be angry at him for being 'mean' to my mum. However, in the recent few years, I have found myself to be repeating his actions and thoughts, though I don't verbalise them as I know how much it would hurt my mum if I were to be rude and treat her how my dad did. I spend 90% of my time at home in my own room because it makes me so upset to see the house outside in such a mess, and I've begun cleaning up the house while my mum's out but I don't think I can singlehandedly bring this house into a liveable and pleasant condition.

Let me explain why I consider my mum to be a hoarder. She buys a lot of stuff with the mentality (or at least how she tries to justify her purchases to me and my brother) that she did not have a lot of stuff when she was growing up, thus she wants to provide the best for her children. I honestly don't think the 'best' means having lots of material possessions, but she seems to think otherwise. This is especially the case for books. I grew up with a love for books that was encouraged by my mum. We would step into Kinokuniya, Borders or PageOne and buy easily 20 books at one go. During Popular book fairs we'd easily spend $300 in a visit. I thought this was normal until I grew out of seeing my mum as a saint and realised that we have a crazy amount of books. In my living room, there are three bookcases that are filled to the brim. We have one bedroom that's meant to be a study room and we have two very large and full bookcases in that room. One of the bookcases fell and we've not been able to open the door. I haven't stepped into that room since 2011. In my bedroom, there's one huge bookcase and one smaller one, both completely full. Also, my mum's FUCKING WINTER CLOTHES take up an entire cupboard in my room. Keep in mind she hasn't visited any country in the winter since I was fucking born. She also has a big IKEA cupboard/desk combination that she uses to keep some of her Junk™ (which I will elaborate more on later). Since my dad moved out, you'd expect my mum to live in the master bedroom, but NO. That room is filled with more books in toyogo plastic containers and More Junk™. I have asked her multiple times to please stop buying so many books, but she always plays pitiful (imagine a 45 year old woman acting cute to get your sympathy. sorry mum I try my best to respect and love you but it's fucking disgusting) and gives me a few stock replies (I just want to provide the best for you/It's not your money why are you concerned/These are good books, you can read them after I do/You can keep them for your kids). Yes, she buys preschool/children's books even though my brother and I are 13 and 17 respectively. When we (my brother matured well and also knows this is abnormal) ask her why, she'll say that we can keep them for our kids, and she likes the colours and pictures so she bought them. Wtf????????

It's not only the hoarding of books, but that she refuses to throw away electrical appliances or broken stuff that we literally do not use anymore. Imagine having a broken portable air conditioner in the middle of your kitchen or a broken luggage outside the toilet LOL. AND SHE HAS SO MANY 'POTENTIAL WAYS OF EARNING MONEY'. She's involved in two MLM schemes - Summit which sells some kind of compression stockings at $100/pair and magical magnetic mattresses at around $3000 if I'm not wrong, and Nefful which sells negative ion (?) clothing that's very expensive. But she isn't an aggressive saleswoman, so we've had a lot of unopened stock in our house for YEARS. In addition to that, she makes jewellery to sell, spending thousands of dollars buying supplies like Swarovski crystals, beads, charms etc. at Chinatown. She keeps all this in more toyogo plastic containers in the living room and in the IKEA cupboard in my room. Then she also sells t-shirts which Christian logos that she gets from a supplier in Malaysia, and this takes up the entire wardrobe space in the master bedroom. She also tries to do mosaic art, thus we have so many glass pieces and those kinda shit in MORE FUCKING TOYOGO PLASTIC CONTAINERS IN THE MASTER BEDROOM. All her DIY shit would be fine if she actually sold it, but the problem is that she fucking doesn't. I've tried to sign her up for flea markets, but she would say that she's too tired to set up shop. Then I've asked her for some stock so I can take pictures of it and sell it online, but then she'd say that she's too lazy to find stock for me and it's always ""another day another day"". And then she blames me that I'm not helping her to sell her stuff and that's why the house has so many things. ?????what???????????

This hoarding has really brought about so much inconvenience to all of us. In my house, you can't walk in a straight line for more than 2 metres. There's so much stuff that it's embarrassing for anyone that isn't the 3 of us to see our house. I've never had friends over (wah wtf when I finally get a boyfriend he can't come to my house), and if our neighbours are outside, we wait for them to enter the lift before stepping out of our house just so that they won't see the insides of our house. The curtains in the house haven't been drawn since 2010, when the hoarding wasn't as scary as it is now (aka when my dad was still here to make her mildly wary of buying stuff), save for those in my room as I actually try to keep my room neat lol. My mum and bro sleep in the living room on the sofa and a mattress on the floor respectively. I used to sleep outside too until I decided I wanted to sleep on my own bed, so I cleaned the bed in what was supposedly my bedroom (it used to be covered with laundry and soft toys ????) and now I kinda have my own room, if not for the fact that 1/2 of the stuff in my room are my mum's.

Due to being ashamed of showing other people our house, we have never called professionals to fix our problems (plumber, electrician, exterminator etc). As a result, we don't have a working light in our toilet and the flush is broken too so we fill a bucket with water in the sink and pour it down the toilet to flush. The shower heater is broken too but that's a minor thing since I've gotten used to it. I once accidentally said to my friends while we were out that I ""wanted to go home before the sun sets to shower"" and I got damn weird stares LOL. Explained it away like it was some weird quirk I had instead of just not wanting to shower in darkness. Our washing machine broke 6 months ago and because of the ashamedofourhouse thing, we can't get a new one delivered and installed. Honestly, even if we weren't ashamed of the mess, there wouldn't be space to move the washing machines in and out. So we've been handwashing our laundry for the past 6 months wtf. I haven't watched TV at home in years because something's wrong with our TV and Starhub box but we can't get them fixed. We have a total of 5 aircons in our house but none of them are working.

Everything would be tolerable, if it were not for the **FUCKING COCKROACHES**. We've always had a minor cockroach problem at home, and before my dad left he thought it'd be a good fucking idea call an exterminator and ask them to spray the gap in the ceiling toilet (the construction of this condo is quite poor) with lots of pesticide or something. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. A few months later, dad had left the house and the ceiling started peeling. Cockroaches would rain down from the fucking ceiling. Cockroaches would crawl up from the fucking drain. Silhouettes of cockroaches would be seen in the fucking ceiling light. So we just decided to abandon ship, turned off the water supply to that toilet and use only the master bedroom's toilet. If I were to open that toilet door now, what I'd see would be the walls dotted with cockroach shit, floor littered with dead/half-dead cockroaches, and the smell's godawful. It doesn't stop there. Sometimes the cockroaches manage to escape from that room, and other times they'd crawl (presumably) along the wiring or something and appear in other rooms. I suspect there's a somehow a tunnel leading from the cracks of one of the tiles to the master bedroom toilet because the cockroaches appear from the fucking cracks or doorframes or what. FYI, these cockroaches are usually about the length of my thumb, and I have large hands for a girl. They are why I avoid going to the toilet at night and keep my toothbrush in my room instead of in the toilet. Cockroaches have appeared on my clothes wtf. I once cleaned the kitchen (while my mum was out ofc) and found a FUCKING CHAR SIEW COCKROACH BEHIND THE OVEN. 

The only good thing I can imagine coming out of this is that I'm not scared of cockroaches LOL. During a school camp the girls were showering in the toilet and suddenly this girl from the neighbouring cubicle shouted ""AAAHHHH GOT VERY BIG COCKROACH!!!!!"" and all the other girls started screaming LMAO. The cockroach crawled to my cubicle and I'm like lolwtf it's the size of my fingernail nia u haven't seen big cockroaches yet. And stepped on it effectively ending its life (with flip flops on la I've not reached *that* stage yet), and they called me a hero LOL. My house doesn't have a lizard problem though, so future boyfriend u can still be my hero if we're near a lizard ;)) (so much for feminism) (fuck eh my sense of humour so stupid I trying to talk about serious problem still can tell joke)

Mentally, this has definitely taken a toll on us as well. The mum frequently tells me that me and my bro are in deep shit if she dies cos then we'll have to clean up the house ourselves. She also often says she wishes to just die quick and painlessly so she doesn't need to deal with this tough life, and that the dad ruined her life. She's borderline emotionally/verbally abusive towards me and my brother too. Not sure if facing this shit everyday is what makes us sad and depressed people but I'm bipolar and I once had a panic attack at home. She hit me while I was hyperventilating and asked me to stop acting like that 'in the name of Jesus' (I go to church but don't really consider myself to be a Christian. more like going cos she wants me to go). Will not elaborate any more on how we are all mentally fucked up but let's just say we don't have those kinda upper middle class instagrammin' mother-daughter relationship that all my friends have. Typing all this info as I would like to ask for advice on what to do to even alleviate this problem in the slightest way possible, given that throwing away my mum's useless stuff while she's out or telling her to her face that she has a problem isn't a viable solution because she's very emotionally volatile, always victimising herself and generally I'll be putting both of us in danger if I do anything rash and drastic. She's one of the unhealthiest people I know, and as much as I hate the condition I'm in, I do not want her to have a mental breakdown or a heart attack.

I'm looking forward to entering university where I'll try to stay in the halls so I don't need to come home but that's two years away. I'm really so tired of this. Where do I draw the line between being respectful and filial and having enough of this shit?? Any advice from anyone, especially if you have dealt with hoarders, would be much appreciated. Considering posting this on /r/relationships or /r/hoarding too, maybe later.

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR, I live with my mum who's a hoarder, and our house is in such a godawful state including a cockroach infestation. I can't do anything drastic cos that may trigger something in her. Advice?

Edit: woah I just came home and read all the comments, I really wasn't expecting so many people to offer such encouraging words. Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice, I'll take them into consideration in deciding what to do next. As for those who were wondering, yes I would say I'm quite well off (at least before the dad left us?? not sure if I would consider myself well off now??? agh). My mum gets an alimony of ~$6000 per month and complains that it's not enough and that the dad is shortchanging her.....????.>.?>.",sgthrowaway_1,I want to die

Questions about Insurance with US/Canada Coverage. Appreciate any suggestions/help.,0,55btd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/55btd4/questions_about_insurance_with_uscanada_coverage/,4,2016-10-01 20:37:33,"I'm looking to buy insurance for the 1st time in my life, and I have no idea what to do.  Did some limited research, here's my situation, what I arrived at.

I'm in my mid 30s, have a wife and a toddler.  No medical issues.  Wife stopped working recently and we're thinking of term life insurance just for me, in case I die, that way they can live on without me.  Maybe 20-30 years or something.  We're thinking of doing it now because we don't have any health issues, my side of the family has a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and I'm still okay now.  If we were to get it later, that might not be true.

Here's where it gets more complicated.  My wife isn't Singaporean.  We currently live in Canada, and are interested in moving back to Singapore for a few years, possibly up to 10, possibly permanently.  In Canada, you want to have medical insurance for prescription medicine, but you don't need the sort of medical you're probably thinking of (free health care, covers operations and other things, though it can be slower and you might want to end up going private).  You do want medical insurance for things like going to the dentist (it's extremely expensive here) or optical (glasses and the like, though that's pretty optional).

I'm in tech, and it's quite possible that I'll be staying in the U.S. for a couple years within the next 10-20 years.  I've done this before on shorter sprints, and in general the big tech firms cover health insurance quite well, but if it's for a startup you're on your own.

Are there insurance options that cover worldwide or North American coverage?  I might be paying extra for health insurance in Singapore to cover time in Singapore, the U.S., and I hope prescription/medicine in Canada, and I'm fine with that.  The same thing goes for life insurance, though I imagine that's less of an issue.

Earlier contributions can be found at http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2no1eu/hokkienteochew_part_iii_the_hokkien_perspective/.

In light of the recent rats infestation at Bukit Batok, I would like to translate a short clip from Workers Party's Lim Ee Ping defending WP in 2012, when there were residents' complaints about rats in Aljunied, which the PAP used to attack WP. 

The clip is [here](http://youtu.be/xBYc0gOQxkE?t=1m28s). Translation is from 1min 30s to 2min 45s.

伊讲，Low Thia Khiang定定照顾后江，无照顾aljunied，aljunied鸟鼠真济.

*i kong, Low Thia Khiang tia tia tsau ko au kang, bo tsau ko aljunied, aljunied niau tshu tsin tsue*

**He (PAP MP. edit: I think it's a PAP supporter, not MP) said, Low Thia Khiang always takes care of Hougang, but not Aljunied. Aljunied has many rats.**

Vocab explanation: 鸟鼠 (niau tshu) means ""rats"" in Hokkien. 济 (tsue) means ""many"". 伊 (i) means ""he/she"".

各位兄弟，选议员是选来拍鸟鼠啊？

*ko ui hia ti, suan gi uan si suan lai pah niau tshu a?*

若是欲拍鸟鼠请两个bangala就够了，何必遮艰苦？

*na si beh pah niau tshu tsia neng e bangala tio gau liao, ho bi tsia kan ko?*

**If we want to fight rats, just hire two Bangladeshi workers. Why make it this complicated?**

Vocab explanation: 遮 (tsia) means ""like this"" in Hokkien. 艰苦 (kan ko) means ""difficult/complicated"".

这种的讲法，会合理无？完全袂合理的讲法嘛。

*tsit tsiong e kong huat, e ha li bo? uan tsuan bue ha li e kong huat ma.*

*ka lan ke khi, kau tsap it ni, Low Thia Khiang tong suan au kang e si tsun, ko u sa kah kong, au gang tsin tsue ho sin!*

**And in our past, in 1991, when Low Thia Khiang got elected in Hougang, there were also Angkat Bolas saying, Hougang has many flies!**

Vocab explanation: 三骹 (sa kah) means ""3-legged"" literally, but it really means people who angkat bola. 胡蝇 (ho sin) means ""houseflies"". 阁 (ko) means ""also"".

I'm in a bit of a pickle here in XX Poly and would like to seek advice and help from people who would understand me best (fellow S'poreans, of course).

Some background:
My course in XX Poly is doing our MP-SIP (Major Project, Student Internship Program) now and we need to form groups of 4 for this.


I've my own clique of friends in school, and 3 of us (A, B and myself) are planning to sign up for an overseas attachment.
However, 2 days ago (26Nov) a classmate of mine (C) whom I've grouped with for quite a bit has requested to join our group. However, C doesn't want to go overseas.

I've worked with this person (C) for 3 semesters and I've found him well to work with, however, we don't hang out at all, just group mates. However, C has no group as of today (Submission's due next week) and doesn't want to be the 'loner' party and have to group up with the 'dropout people'.

As A & B really want to go overseas, I decided to be as gentlemanly as I could and split our group up into two. A & B, C and Myself.
The rest of my course has formed groups (sure, there may be 1 or 2 lying around every class, but they're unwanted for a reason), so there's no way I can allocate C to anyone.

However, I too really want to go overseas to do my attachment and have spouted this thought of just leaving C to die and going overseas with my friends.

Would everyone give me your thoughts and help me make up my mind?
1: Just suck it up, be a nice person, forsake this once in a lifetime chance & group with C and stay in Singapore
2: Leave C to his own issues, return to my group with A & B, but how would I tell C that?

Do pardon the structure of the essay as my mind can't think straight right now, stressing out over this.
Ask for more context and I'll get back instantly if it'll help me reach a decision.
Also, throwaway account for reasons.

If anyone wants to help me get the message across to C, I'd treat you to caipng, 2meat 1fish 2veg. Lava yall.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. I'll have to think things through with regards to this.
It's going to be hard for me to talk to C though.

EDIT2: I've spoken to C and have got her out of my group. Thanks for the advice, /r/singapore. I'm sure I won't regret this choice. Who wants the caipng?",dontliddatley,I want to die

Like the title says, a few of my friends and I are keen on establishing a YouTube gaming channel.

We don't really want it to be top-notch, like the other well-known channels such as PewDiePie, UberHaxorNova or whatnot, we're just hoping for a decent number of views and subscriptions.

Problem is, most of the games we play don't really appeal to most local gamers here. Games like DayZ, Mount & Blade: Warband, Borderlands 2 and Garrysmod (Trouble in Terrorist Town & Morbus) are examples. It's difficult to find a server, let alone people, to record our sessions with, when everyone else is off playing Dota 2 or League of Legends.

Usually, I would end up hosting, and my friends would join in. This wouldn't be much of a problem in small, story-driven, co-op games, like Borderlands 2 or Left 4 Dead 2. But in bigger mass-multiplayer games, like Mount & Blade or Garrysmod, we often run out of things to record.

We're a small party of four to five people, so we're hoping to grow that number to around 10 or 15 with online people that share the same interests as us. We have a Mumble server for our gaming needs too.

We usually play on the weekends, or sometimes during the weekdays, if we have enough people.

A few months ago I bought a very cheap ticket to Singapore on a Lufthansa one-day sale. I didn't plan much before leaving, the only thing I had sorted out before I left home was the hotel. I've been here 3 days now, and I think I'm about to fall in love with this place :) 

This is what I've done so far (not much really):

Monday: Just checking out the CBD and the marina, trying not to die from heatstroke - I'm from the norternmost parts of Norway, we rarely get this kind of heat back home, and it's never ever been as humid as here. Mostly spent time in places with aircondition, I even took an otherwise unnecessary ride on the MRT just to cool down :) Had beer and food at Brewerkz (I found out about this place through r/singapore) before going back to the hotel.

Tuesday: Overslept (I blame the jetlag, not the beer). Had ""breakfast"", took the MRT to the CBD, walked along the north side of the marina (past that floating stadium thingy and the helix bridge) to Marina Bay Sands to check out the view from the observation deck.  Still trying to get used to the heat. Went back to the CBD, through Boat Quay up to Brewerkz and had a beer (or was it three?). Went back to the hotel for a very much needed shower - and returned to the marina in the evening to take some nighttime photos of your beautiful skyline (we do not have anything remotly close to this in Norway) More beer at the hotel before getting to bed. (Yes, I do love beer...) 

Today: Woke up late again (guess I can't blame jetlag anymore...), went to Singapore Zoo, spent many, many hours there, loved it - again, back to the hotel for a quick shower and a short nap, went back to MBS to see the light show which I missed yesterday, and then walked back to the hotel (which is close to Lavender MRT) via Little India - had a late dinner at some place along the way..


And here I am :)


What's next? Any advice on what not to miss while in Singapore? I've heard a lot about the Night Safari - I've tried to check out their webpage, but for some reason the page won't load (I'm on a really slow internet connection) Anywhooo, I've been to Namibia and Botswana before, so I'm not sure if I really need to see this. What kind of animals do you get to see?

I've seen lots of advertising/brochures about Sentosa, but I do not think that place is made for me - sounds kinda boring to be honest.. The only thing I possibly would want to see there is the underwaterworld(?) - unless you know of some hidden gems out there? 

I would like to take at least one day trip out of the country - I know that there are boats crossing over to Indonesia - but is there anything interesting to see at those places, or is it just resorts?
I also wonder if it's possible to take a daytrip to Kuala Lumpur? AirAsia seems to have rather cheap tickets on offer, and if I take an early flight out, and a late flight back it seems to be possible... Any other daytrip suggestions?

Moving out?,33,9n1t2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9n1t2j/moving_out/,41,2018-10-11 09:56:19,"Are Singaporeans doomed to either waiting until 35 (if I'm not wrong it's the minimum age to own hdb as a single) or jumping into a marriage to basically move out?
I can't be the only one who wants to strike out on his own, away from his family to have some quality ""me"" time without anyone breathing down his neck. 

To tell you about myself, I'm a quiet early-20s guy who never had a room to himself. Over the years I have tolerated sharing the room with my sibling, but as of late I am at my limit and even the smallest thing he does (not having personal space as a person who values being alone is one thing, living with someone who's an ass is another) can set me off (not that I really go into a fit, I'm a master at bottling up my emotions but I guess that makes it worse huh). I don't see how I can survive like that any longer. And I just recently finished NS, which was my first source of income. I'm abit more adventurous when it comes to money so experimented with it abit. And that meant new experiences and hobbies, away from the digital world of my ex-favourite hobby of gaming and into the physical one. Of which they require space, time and  being away from the judgy or kpo eyes from my family (which is definitely always there since I have no personal space). 

Dont get me wrong, I love my family and home, but recently I find that I just need my own personal space. Not to the fault of anyone, it's just human nature I guess? I don't know if I can wait until 35 and marriage doesn't solve the issue since it doesn't really give me space, does it...

I'm sure many out there are in worse conditions (family abuse etc.) so I'm wondering how you survived too.

World Mental Health Day 2017,200,75eq2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/75eq2i/world_mental_health_day_2017/,46,2017-10-10 20:27:24,"[List of helplines](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/NCSS/media/NCSS-Documents-and-Forms/NCSS%20Internal%20Documents/LIST-OF-HELPLINES.pdf) provided by the National Council of Social Service.

Over the past year or so on this sub there’s been an increase in the number of people asking for advice/help regarding mental health issues. 

Practically, it’s not possible for those experienced in these matters to reply to every single comment from each daily thread. Hence, I’ve decided to make this thread to consolidate some of the common answers to those seeking advice regarding getting help for mental health in this country.

My post will be geared towards seeking help from public institutions, as I’m not familiar with how things work in the private ones.

I’ll try my best to be as objective as possible in this post, but as someone who’s been dealing with issues of his own lately, I’m compelled to share some of my personal experiences and observations as well.

********

# In case of an emergency:

If you’re suffering from suicidal ideation or are otherwise in distress, and need someone to speak to, you can call the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS)’s 24-hour hotline at **1800-221-4444** or email them at pat@sos.org.sg. 

If you or someone you know are at danger to yourself or others, **call 995** immediately or **walk-in to any A&E Department** at any hospital. 

*****************

Suicidal feelings are temporary in nature, however permanent they might feel presently. The important thing is to keep yourself safe by any means necessary during this period of crisis. If that means you need to be hospitalized, then you should be willing to do so for your own safety and well-being. 

If you are deemed to be at physical danger to others or to yourself by the relevant authorities and professionals, you may be detained at IMH for up to 72 hours, or longer, under the Mental Health Act. This happened to me after my first suicide attempt. Yes, it sucks, but it's not as scary as it sounds. 

Currently, the only public hospitals which offer **inpatient** psychological and psychiatric care are IMH, NUH, SGH, TTSH, and CGH. 

Your mileage may vary on the quality of treatment and care that you’ll receive at IMH. If you do not wish to seek treatment at IMH, you can always ask for a referral to a hospital of your choosing. 

Outpatient psychological and psychiatric care is offered at all hospitals, but not all treatment options are available at every institution. 

*****************

# FAQs:

Q: I’m in need of professional help but am having financial difficulties. What should I do?

A: If cost is an issue and/or you do not require emergency care, you can get a referral from a polyclinic to see a psychiatrist as well as a psychologist at a hospital of your preference. If you are a youth (aged between 16 and 30) you may obtain a free and confidential mental health check from [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/about-chat/who-chat/). 

You can ask to speak to a Medical Social Worker (MSW) at the hospital you’re seeking treatment at to possibly obtain subsidies. Subsidies of up to 100% under the Medifund scheme is available for Singaporeans.

Health is and should always be top priority - both physical and mental. This is Singapore. You will not be thrown out of the hospital because you don’t have any money to pay for medical treatment. 

Financial help is available. Getting it can be tedious, frustrating, time-consuming, annoying, but that’s the inconvenient nature of all bureaucracies. And please do remember that the professionals helping you are not your enemy--the illness is; and the golden rule applies everywhere and to everyone. 

Q: I’ve been feeling really (insert relevant adjective) these days. Am I suffering from (insert relevant disorder)?

A: None of us here are qualified to answer this question. We can only commiserate, empathize, provide emotional support, share our perspectives/views/opinions with you as well as respond to the specific issues you’re facing. To get a concrete answer to this question, you will need to consult with a psychiatrist, which would be beneficial for you (and your loved ones) in both the short and long-term. 

Q: Will there be a “record” which will affect my employment/scholarship/school admission prospects if I seek treatment from/am admitted to IMH? 

A: No. Your medical records are private and confidential. 

Q: Will I be discriminated against in employment/scholarship/school admission applications because of the fact that I have been diagnosed with and/or am suffering from a mental illness / disorder?

A: No. Your medical records are private and confidential. However, should you choose to disclose your condition, do know that discrimination might be a possibility, and that it does not reflect your worth as an individual should your application be rejected. 

&nbsp;

***************

&nbsp;

Stigma against mental illness and those who have them is still prevalent in our society and countless others around the world. The most effective way to combat this is by educating the public about mental health. Things are improving, but we still have a long way to go to ensure that individuals suffering from mental illnesses are not subject to undue prejudice which may impede on their recovery process. 

The first, and most important thing you can do for a loved one who is suffering is to simply listen to them. Don’t just post an empty, meaningless hashtag on social media to affect your empathy towards those in distress when in fact you may have none. Talk to them, ask them how was their day and if they’ve had something to eat. When was the last time they went out to do something fun? What are their interests? What is currently upsetting them so much that everything in life just seems so pointless, meaningless, empty, futile? That each day is filled with so much misery and angst and anguish and pointless suffering?

No one’s asking you to take responsibility for their well-being; and in many cases it’s not healthy for you to do so even if you may wish to. Just listen. More often than not, in the process of talking and thinking it out, individuals in distress find the answers to these questions of their own accord. The process and road to recovery may take a month, a year or perhaps even a lifetime. But the important thing is to keep moving ahead, one step at a time. 

For those in distress, I can't promise you that things will get better, nor can I tell you that you shouldn't kill yourself. It would be morally unjust for me to make that decision for you, because this is your life, after all, and you get to decide what to do with it. But what I can say with the utmost conviction is that the good days, though they may be few and far between, are worth living for, no matter how ugly the bad ones get. 

I hope you can find the strength to pull through your period of crisis.

And please remember to take care of yourself. Be kind and gentle to yourself When you’re in distress, suffering from an illness so unbearable it makes you not even want to get out of bed each day, even the simplest of tasks may feel Sisyphean in nature. Take it one step at a time. If all your day consists of is you getting out of bed and taking a shower, then that’s great! Do that again the next day, and the next, and the one after that. Then, take the next small step and make yourself a healthy breakfast. Find comfort wherever you can find it. Allow yourself to indulge in your favourite books and movies and video games and other activities. Try to go out for walks and just soak in the sights and sounds of your neighbourhood. Notice the little things. The leaves falling off the trees. Kids jumping around and chasing each other in the playground. The roar of the motorcycle. The heavy sigh of the stopping bus. The smell of the earth after a heavy rain. If for nothing else, these are just gentle reminders that life exists. That you exist. And that there will be a tomorrow and that the sun will rise again no matter how dark the night gets (barring the heat death of the universe, but that’s a whole other topic altogether…). 

These little things may not seem like much but they do make a huge difference, especially so when your brain has tricked you into thinking that nothing, nothing, nothing matters anymore. That it's all worthless. But it isn't. Your brain's lying to you. There still are things and people worth living for - and you are one of them.

You are worth it, and don’t let anyone, or anything, even the stupid illness, tell you otherwise.  

Listen: I've been in your shoes one too many times and I know just how much it hurts. The constant agony of vacillating between wanting to live and wanting nothing but death. I want to say that you don't have to go through these struggles alone. Professional help is available if you need it and especially so if you really want it.

So stay safe, and [take care](https://i.reddituploads.com/81b1167bca5f4253802e399771798329?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=650ade81000e686612bfb7217dbc8d7e)! 

And share your story; talk about it without fear or shame, for you have nothing to fear and nothing to be ashamed of. I can’t promise to read them all, but know that your voice and your story has not gone unheard.

Course of action to take against noisy neighbours?,7,4zh2a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4zh2a5/course_of_action_to_take_against_noisy_neighbours/,30,2016-08-25 21:50:42,"Long wall of text here.

My family knew these gits for over ten years - they were the unsavoury sort that gossips about you behind your back but my parents tolerated their behaviour for years and had never confronted them about it.

Recently (Around the end of last year to be exact), loud banging could be heard from their daughters' room. My room's directly next to hers' and my computer table is placed directly against the wall in question.

Vibrations could be felt and initially, we did not confront them about it till two or three months later.

We subtly mentioned to our neighbours about the banging on the wall and asked them if they could hear it too. My neighbours feigned ignorance and claimed that they heard nothing.

The noise harassment continued and after a month or so, we asked them if their daughter was practising ""martial arts"" in her room. Again, she feigned ignorance and claimed that she heard nothing from her daughter's room.

After several months of pestering them to stop in various, subtle ways, the lying witch claims that she heard ""loud knocking sounds"" from the flat above us and that she would search for assistance in the matter.

Of course, it was a lie and the noise pollution never stopped over the course of several months. My mother finally snapped and she warned their daughter that she would call the cops on her. (Just an empty threat of course)

According to her, their daughter seems to have gone into a panic and their mother **CALLED** the cops on us instead.

Two cops and a town council employee appeared on our doorsteps. After explaining the situation to them, they seemed pretty hell bent on believing my neighbours' far-fetched tale that the sounds came from upstairs and refused to accept my explanations.

The town council dude claimed that he would continue on with the investigation and there was a moment of peace for a quarter of a month or so.

However, the silence was short-lived and the knocking returned. Accompanying it were additional noises from upstairs since the investigation seems to have offended the other neighbours and the ones above started dragging their chairs and stomping their feet.

Feeling aggravated by the constant disturbance in my household, I confronted my neighbours directly and got into a verbal argument with them. Again, there was a moment of peace (Ignoring the sounds from upstairs since it doesn't occur as often as the ones from the gits next door) but the knocking returned with escalated intensity.

It seems that they are taking ""shifts"" to knock on the wall as well since the knocking could be heard on typical working / school hours according to my mother. (There were no noise from the sides at this time period prior to said confrontation)

This continued throughout the year (I got really irritated and started retaliating once in a while and the investigation ended up with ""a drummer moved in two floors above us"" - how ridiculous is that?) and recently, my family got into an argument with them again and the knocking seems to have increased in intensity as well. They claimed that they were not the perpetrators of the noise pollution and insists on the fact that they are hearing the noise as well and invited us into their household.

I went in and while I do hear some knocking, it seems to be coming from a direction away from our shared wall and I noticed that their maid wasn't present throughout the confrontation.

The noise seems to be oddly loud and doesn't seem to be muffled either.

When I directed to her about the vibrations on our shared wall, she seems to be averting her gaze as well and continuously posed red herrings by talking about how we were ""neighbours for ten years and that we were wonderful neighbours."" (Amusingly enough, she called the cops on us despite all that)

Their daughter was extremely agitated throughout the entire confrontation and was constantly jumping on her feet, cursed my parents, started insulting my parents in English (My parents are English illiterate) and proclaimed that she did not cause the pollution in question.

She made an odd statement by accusing me of ""knocking on the wall repeatedly, **too**."" When I retorted by saying that whether it's a confession on her part by saying ""too"", she immediately remained silent throughout the entire confrontation.

Predictably, after the second confrontation, the noises stopped for a period of time but returned a few days after with greater intensity.

TL;DR : Neighbours are lying douchebags, keeps knocking on shared wall, Town Council investigation wound up with nothing (Neighbours claimed that they called it off since it ""offended us""), investigation seems to have offended the neighbours upstairs since they're making noises too and despite multiple confrontations they would keep knocking on the wall with increased intensity.

**Malaysia:** Khairul Fahmi, Mahalli, Shukor, Azammuddin, Muslim, Zubir, Muslim, Safiq, Gary Robbat, Amri Yahya, Safee.

I'll try to update  as the match goes. Go Lions!

-30' [Stadium still half empty with 30 minutes to kick off.](http://i.imgur.com/D4Z2IS7.jpg) Hopefully it fills up in time.

-5' National anthems sung, great atmoshpere here. Secretly impressed by the Malaysian ultra fans, who have been chanting and jumping. Bonus: [this Malaysia flag unfurled during the a them which gained a round of applause from the SG fans](http://i.imgur.com/D4Z2IS7.jpg)

0' Kick off!

2' Fazrul Nawaz's cross crom the right is cleared by Mahalli for a corner, but nothings comes of it.

4' Fazrul Nawaz's cross/shot goes narrowly off the far post.

10' Singapore counter attack with Faris in loads of space, but Fazrul's cross was so off target that it bobs straight to Khairul Fahmi.

14' Free kick for Singapore from 30 yards out after Khairul was hauled down by Shukor. Shaiful takes, but the cross was way wide.

17' Safuwan to the rescue! Fine tackle to sopt Azamuddin's cross in for Safee. Close shave for Singapore.

18' Singapore go on the counter but only Faris is in the Malaysia half. He cuts in and beats two defenders, but loses the ball to two more.

20' Shouts for a penalty as Nohshahrul goes down in the box but ref says it's a fair tackle.

Fan check: Malaysia fans have stopped singing for the first time in 45 mins.

26' Shahril Ishak fouls after a poor pass from Shahfiq Ghani gave the ball away. Free kick for Malaysia from 30 yards out.  Easily cleared though.

28' Fazrul Nawaz sends another wayward cross in straight to Khairul Fahmi. 0 out of 3 crosses successsful so far.

29' Ref waves away protests after fous on Fazrul and Faris. Crowd unleashes the famous chant on him.

30' Yellow card! Finally. Gary Robbatt is booked after a poor challenge on Hariss Harun.

37' Fazrul is booked after a foul on Safee to stop a Malaysia counter-attack. 

41' Hariss fouled n the left side of the box. Free kick in from Shaiful was met by Khairul Fahmi, who was fouled in the box. Free kick for Malaysia instead.

42' Malaysia hit the post! Ball in from Azammuddin was deflected by Ismadi, Safee picks it up and fires it into the bar!

44' Khairul Amri goes on a mazy run to beat through the entire Malaysia defence but dribbled out for a goal kick. Waste of a chance.

**HALFTIME**

Personal remark: the catered food for the press sucks. 

Tactical observations: Singapore seem content to sit back and counter with only Khairul Amri up front but Malaysia are recovering quickly to snuff out the threat. Shahril Ishak has been a disappointment - not running to link the attack at all. He looked tired after 25 minutes. 

46' Malaysia go on the attack straight away with Mahalli free on the overlap but Esah recovered quickly to block it.

49' Faris has a great chance outside the box after evading the Malaysian defence, but his shot was sent low and juuuuuuust wide.


52' Hariss wriggles free in midfield and sends a through pass to Faris, who was ran into by Mahalli. Ref says no foul.

53' It's a foul this time as Shahfiq Ghani wa brought down from 35 yards out. Amri Yahya is booked for a foul.

54' Free kick from Esah short for Safuwan, who fires high and wide from range.

56' Close shave! Mat Yo beats the Singapore offside trap but couldn't control the ball as Hassan Sunny rushes out. Ball cleared off the line by Safuwan!

57' Chance for Singapore after Faris was brought down just outside the box, but Khairl Amri curls it wide of the near post. 

59' Substitution for Malaysia: Hafiz on, Gary off

60' Shaiful Esah tries to lob Safee but chips the ball straight to him instead. He fouls him straight to concede a free kick on the right edge of the box.

60' Hafiz whips in the free kick straight at Hassan Sunny, who pushed the ball out out to be cleared out.

62' FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU. Malaysia score and are 1-0 up. Poor defending from Safuwan let a cross from Amri Yahya slip to Safee Sali, who had all the time in the world to line up a powerful shot into the top corner. Singapore need an equaliser urgently.

64' Substitution for Singapore: Fazrul Nawaz, Shaiful Esah OFF, Gabriel Quak, Hafiz Sujad ON

65' Off the pitch: Singapore fans have been disappointingly quiet so far, while Malaysia's small contingent have been jumping, waving scarves and chanting non-stop.

66' Free kick for Singapore on the right side after Hariss Harun was fouled by Zukir. Poor free kick from Shahfiq Ghani, low and straight into the defence.

67' Malaysia counter and Mat Yo puts it into the box, but he was offside from Safee Sali's pass.

73' Shukor booked for time wasting.

74' Amri Yahya sneaks behind the defence on the counter, but was denied by a touch from Ismadi, who got a foot in on the ball from behind.

76' Corner kick from Singapore after Hariss' long range shot was deflected out. Khairul Fahmi punches it out  to safety.

77' Substitution for Singapore, Shahfiq Ghani OFF,  Amirul Adli ON

78' Khairul Fahmi clatters  into Khairul Amri outside the box, but the ref says no foul. Fans are livid.

81' Gabriel Quak pierces through the midfield, rolls the ball on ffor KKhairul Amri, whose fierce shot was striaght at Khairul Fahmi.

82' Free kick for Singapore after Safuwan was pushed by Muslim. 30 yards out, let's see...

83' GGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!! Free kick from Safuwan is parried by Khairul Fahmi, but Khairul Amri was there to tap it in!!!!!! 1-1!!!! Stadium is alive now!

85' Another freekick for Singapore after Faris was brought down, but the free kick was parried for a corner by Khairul Fahmi.

87' Another free kick after Faris was fouled again, this time by Hafiz. 30 yards out, but it's straight into the clutches of Khairul Fahmi.

88' Substitution for Malaysia: Safee OFF, Indra Putra ON. 

90' Substition for Malaysia: Norshahrul OFF, Manaf ON

90' Four minutes added on

91' CONTROVERSY! REF GIVES A PENALTY! NOBODY WAS EVEN APPEALING FOR ONE.

93' Nobody has a clue what happened, but Safiq Rahim slots the penalty on the opposite side of the keeper.. Malaysia fans spilling out now, security guards crowding them. Chaos.

95' Last chance fo Singapore. Free kick on the left wing.

96' Malaysia score instead! Hassan Sunny went up for the free kick, which was sent in and looked like it had a foul in there, but Malaysia counter attack. Indra Putra sprints up and has the easy open goal.

**FULL TIME: SINGAPORE 1-3 MALAYSIA**

Malaysia are through - deservingly so after a poor performance from Singapore, who did nothing with the massive home support.

Scenes here as fans are throwing toilet rolls and water bottles on the pitch jeering the referee (and our players. But the ref, mainly.)  

Also Sahil Suhaimi or Hafiz Sujad (I think) was caught flaring up by the pitch chasing off photographers.

---

For reasons unknown, a 16 year-old secondary 4 student from Damai Secondary School commited suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his own room. He was discovered by his parents, who had knocked on the door of his room several times before realizing something was amiss.

According to neighbors of the family, the suicide took place last night. They had reported hearing anxious knocking on a door for several minutes before hearing loud wails from the mother. Concerned neighbors who had gone up to the family to ask what was wrong were informed by the father of the boy that his son had hung himself.

The secondary 4 student was described as a distant boy by neighbors. They said that the family had 3 children, a daughter who studies at a local polytechnic, and a younger boy aged 9. When probed further, neighbors recalled that the deceased was more reticent because he would hardly greet others when he met them as compared to his older sister and younger brother.

The parents and the sister of the deceased boy were in the mortuary today to identify the boy's remains. The mother of the boy was emotional and refused any requests for comments while her daughter placed her hand on her mother's shoulder to comfort her.

Police have confirmed they are investigating the case as ""unnatural death"".

Would like to take this post to tell the suicidal/ depressed people of /r/Singapore that you're not alone and there's always someone to talk to in time of needs. Please seek help from professionals. 

I don't know your story, your past, or the circumstances that led to this very moment but please know that even the glimmer of hope and chance of you going on could lead to something you might never have imagined.

Rest in peace to the student who decided to take his own life.

"Help/Advice Wanted for me, a socially awkward guy.",14,382as8,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/382as8/helpadvice_wanted_for_me_a_socially_awkward_guy/,67,2015-06-02 02:00:14,"Hello r/singapore,
I lurk around on this reddit most of the times, sometimes coming across threads where people post their personal issues and sometimes the responses given are truly helpful and compassionate.

Hence, I have decided to speak up and pluck up the courage to talk about my personal issues as a result.
Sorry if my message comes off as blunt and impersonal, but it could be the way I phrase my message/content :<
Forgive me if my words seem very awkwardly phrased as well, because even as I am posting this, I have my doubts and uncertainties because I generally don't have enough courage to speak up, be it in public or online.

Okay, so first off:

1. I have low self confidence/esteem and sometimes suspect I may have mental issues
This has been a problem with me since young, as I can never seem to have enough confidence in myself. Additionally, sometimes I feel that I have mental issues because of how easily I get anxious and stressed out over the smallest of things. 
I heard that if you wanted to be checked for mental issues, the government hospitals may indicate that on your medical records and it may affect your likelihood for employment in the future, is that true?
I decided to see my school counselor(s) this year, albeit with not much change yet, although I know change doesn't happen overnight, but yeah. 
Sometimes I also feel so depressed over my studies and workload (especially this year) to the point of giving up school, and thoughts of suicide have came across my mind, but only to pass through quickly, because I know that its foolish and not the way out.
However, that being said, even though I am worried about my studies, sometimes I still find myself procrastinating and spending a few hours on end on YouTube and etc., so I'm not sure if this is just me being lazy or really a serious issue beneath.


2. I have very poor socializing experiences and interpersonal skills.
I would say this happened because of my previous poor experiences when interacting with people, my family background, my personality and etc. 
Moreover, I was bullied in primary and secondary school (poor experiences when interacting with people)

As a result, I tend to be very hesitant to express my emotions openly as I fear that if I delve too deep into a relationship only to have that relationship end, that amount of hurt it gives me, because I am someone who treasures the few relationships I do have.

3. I have a rather strong distrust of people around me. 
This is related to the above point of me being socially awkward and because of my lack of socializing experiences. I tend to shun away from people and social situations because it feels weird and foreign to me to be attending one, and because I lack the experience to do so.

For points 2-3, these have affected my ability when participating in group projects, because of my inability to communicate/interact/behave? properly around people, which is a crucial problem for me considering the amount of group work I have to do.

All in all, I don't know what to expect from this thread, but if its mostly negative replies, then I don't really know.. It could just be me being lazy? and not being a proper person.  I don't know... I just feel so troubled at times. I'm not even sure whether people will take this thread seriously...

*I'm currently having exams, so apologies for my late replies...

Edit: 

As of 2nd June, I have read every comment here and I am grateful for the replies so far.
**In case this thread gets removed/old, I will post more threads in the future to ask about how to improve myself, I really appreciate the comments you guys have posted so far**
Some answers to the comments though:

Some of your advice has been given to me as well, like 
1) talking more often to people I know, however, I still have my reservations, but I acknowledge that I do need to attempt to talk more often

2) Its true that my low self esteem makes me feel even worse about myself when I'm watching YouTube or reading reddit, but sometimes I feel that its also me putting off the tasks that I actually need to do (procrastinating). It varies a lot for me though, I could spend as long as a whole afternoon from 1pm-5pm doing stuff that I shouldn't be doing

3) With regards to my anxiety issues, it has affected me in a few ways:
a. Interacting with people (I get discouraged easily after a ""bad"" experience (from my perspective) with someone, and makes it very very hard for me to talk to that other person again)
b. Trusting people
c. Academic performance [I have a cumulative GPA around the 3.5-3.9 range for the first year (2 semesters), and yet I still have no confidence in myself, panicking during exams, like being unable to finish my papers] 
Moreover, this year has been quite bad for me, because its the first time I'm doing Problem Based Learning (no lecture notes, create your own notes)

With regards to my counselling, most people have also told me that they don't think I have mental issues. However, my main concern now is about how badly my anxiety will affect my health, as well as my daily life.

All in all, I'm just worried that I can't handle the stress and break down, drop out, because I kind of use my stress in order to force/motivate myself to study and perform to the best I can.

Sorry for posting but I'm honestly not sure how long I can still hold on. 
**Can you please recommend some good places/people/things to do that actually help with depression/anxiety in Singapore?** (please no imh, horror stories)

I've suffered from depression for many years after being ostracised in secondary school. It was pretty bad, boarding on the fringe of physical bullying. And even after many years, I still get the occasional nightmare about them/""the main bully"" or nightmares about school related things. Sleep is often disrupted even though I havent seen them for years, and even though things at school may be okay/ even if I'm not schooling.

I've been struggling with self love for many years. Each night, I attempt to suffocate myself in attempt to get some relief. I honestly wish I could be dead. I have nice parents, but they don't seem to know how to help when depression hits hard. I'm always suffering alone.

I've already tried several counsellors/psychiatrists/therapists in Singapore. One in the secondary school I was from, one from another school, one public counsellor (who felt like they didn't care at all), and two private psychiatrists. Each time, they all might have worked somewhat at first, but eventually stopped caring/ being understanding. 

My most recent one is the one I've been getting my meds from, but they scolded me when I told them about my wishes to die every night. I've tried exercising (jogging, swimming) but I'm at the point where I'm too sad to try.
Eating nice food helps, but only for the moment. Art, animals... a lot of things only seem to help for a second or not at all. It doesn't solve the actual issue.

**TLDR; Any recommendations of good therapists / things to do / self help methods to try to help to cure depression? Thank you.**

Some sentimental reflections about my gaming experience when I was young: spending most of my teenage years in virtual worlds (MMORPGs),202,8h3k81,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8h3k81/some_sentimental_reflections_about_my_gaming/,103,2018-05-05 15:29:41,"*Note: nothing particularly interesting here, just my random thoughts so don't expect anything.*

For the majority of my adolescence (from secondary 1 to JC) I have spent most of my time after school in virtual worlds - MMORPG games where you create your own character online and lived in your life in online worlds. I am sure most of us have played Runescape and other lesser known ones like Cabal. I still keep in-game screenshots of my characters, each picture depicted a certain moment after school: eating dinner in front of my computer, waking up early on a Saturday morning etc.

I am getting sentimental because in hindsight I realised how much this has defined who I am today. Being in an MMORPG you are either comfortable in your own world, grinding alone (introvert), or you join a guild/clan and do missions together (extrovert). I did a bit of both, but if you put it in proportion I'd say 90% of my time I was grinding alone. Some very, very alone hours, me listening to bgms, pressing keys to cast skills, picking up drops and money from killed loot. 

And that was....a substantial amount of time. Nearly every day, for at least 4 to 5 hours, that was me, killing monsters (mobs) running between virtual locations. A lot of alone time, and since I don't play popular games like DotA etc this specific genre of MMORPG requires very little interactions between players. Sometimes I wish I hadn't done this, if I had played more sociable ones like DotA or even CS I would have made more friends and create stronger bonds, but being in a MMORPG like Cabal or PerfectWorld has made me so comfortable in my own bubble. I am not a pariah so I did talk to other characters online but they were usually random people from eastern europe, Indonesians and Singaporeans (CabalSEA) which you don't keep in touch in real life.

Those were 6 years in total. Right now I don't play any games and haven't logged in to any accounts for years, but if you would ask me, most of my 'life' was spent in those 6 years. Those times felt more real than anything, and very bittersweet because I loved it, but I pity myself for being so reclusive.

Bit a about me. I'm 27, moved to Singapore last year for work. The excitement upon moving here was overwhelming, the life and cultural experiences I would gain, the professional advancement, the chance to travel. I was finally getting rewarded for years of hardwork with my company and given a chance to see the word and grow. It all sounded incredible. The reality however, is that I felt isolated almost immediately. I am relatively inexperienced for the specific field that I am now working in and I learned it real fast. I've been advancing quickly, but I have felt like an outsider the entire time. My insecurities towards my professional life have made it extremely difficult to network and develop a friend group, and has led me down a path of constant anxiety and depression. Now, a bit of a backstory about me. When I was in college I tried my hand at online poker. Despite the fact that I had no bankroll management skills, I developed pretty quickly into a strong player. I continued to play and play and play, always making loads and busting it all. I was lucky to cash out any amount. Anyways, I thought those days were long behind me until I moved out here. To cope withy anxiety and depreesion, I began gambling heavily out here. And I mean very heavily. On the weekends I would find myself at mbs or sentosa playing blackjack for 1k a hand, betting sports online for several thousands...I have depleted all of my money that I've earned from my job, so I turned to money lenders. I don't gamble anymore, but I continually have to borrow in order to pay back existing lenders. It's crazy to think that I make over 10k a month and can't get a loan from an actual bank. The interest rates on the money lender loans is killing me! I have talked with my parents and they can only offer their love to me. This year I'm going to start seeing someone about my depressive thoughts and unhappiness. Work wise, things are actually going well. I still very much feel like an outsider but I've been making great improvements despite the way I feel. I really need help out of this deep dark hole, but truth is I have no one to talk to or that will listen. I owe 19,800 in money lender loans, and I have 75 dollars in my bank account to make it until February.

"Calling out The Saber Authority, a lightsaber duelling group in SG that claims to teach practical fighting techniques. That's bullshit and you know it.",424,7plc03,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7plc03/calling_out_the_saber_authority_a_lightsaber/,186,2018-01-11 19:39:44,"For those who are unfamiliar with [The Saber Authority](https://www.thesaberauthority.com/), they are a group that has gained a considerable amount of fame for teaching saber dueling (they can't say lightsaber because of the copyright I suppose) here in Singapore. They advertise quite a lot on Facebook, and one of their videos has 4 million views on Youtube.

That's not what I have a problem with. The issue is their marketing material and website make multiple mentions that what they teach is not just fantasy, but actual combat techniques. Here are some extracts from their website:

>We teach only real techniques that can be used in real life self-defense situations. We don't believe in fictional styles or choreographed combat.

>The Combat Saber System is based on actual combat blade fighting, therefore grading is strict, and the skills needed for masteries are real.

A testimonial on their site from a student shows that the apprentices buy into the bullshit. 

>I joined because the combat system is solid and battle-proven. There is no bullshit here. It's simple enough for beginner to try and yet vast and complicated to master.

So this is the easy part of my call-out: proving that it's bullshit.

I can't believe I have to say this, but lightsabers are weapons from fantasy. Taking what you see on the silver screen and adopting it for real-life combat is just about the easiest way to get your ass kicked. Consider [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH24gQ8vUoc) video. Can you imagine any of that hurting you? Lightsabers in the movies focus on quick movements more than heavy attacks, because lightsabers only really need contact to cut. In real life, you need to do more than just swing your arm around to hurt someone. You need to generate proper momentum and put your weight behind your strikes to deal actual damage.

Let's look at a ""combat"" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smSAnaDaSjY). Lots of needless flailing of the weapon, sure it looks cool but it serves zero practical purpose. Lots of empty pointless footwork that only serves to tire you out. 

Here's [one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdjyONn1wiw), of their seniors training. They don't actually seem interested in hitting one another in vital spots, again they seem to more actively target each other's weapons. When sparring in real martial arts, we are taught to strike with the intention to hit, without putting power behind our attacks. However, none of the strikes I've seen from any of their videos look remotely dangerous. I assume the reason is because the lightsabers are kids toys that are not meant to withstand real impact. They would probably snap like twigs when used as a weapon.

Lastly, I would like to make comparisons to other weapon-based martial arts. Practitioners of Kendo and Fencing wear protective gear. At TSA, most of them use no protective gear, and at most use a helmet and wrist guards. It's obvious that they don't need protection because they aren't in danger of hurting anyone. But for a martial art that teaches ""real techniques"", why are you in zero danger of getting hurt? 

A Kendo or Fencing match looks incredibly different from the duels at TSA. True masters patiently wait for an opening to strike or counter, while maintaining proper spacing from the enemy. TSA duelists seem more interested in looking cool, all while the instructor yells ""power, power"" out repeatedly, probably reminding them not to hurt each other. Real combat, indeed.

So why is this a big deal? Because **it is dangerous to say you are teaching practical martial arts, when you're not.** You're giving your students fighting confidence that is vastly disproportionate to their actual abilities. If they get into an actual fight they could be seriously hurt, or even killed. 

If you suck at fighting and you know you suck, chances are you will do the smart thing during a confrontation, and run. If you suck at fighting but think you're awesome, you might actually take a crack at it, and end up seriously hurt.

So I'm calling out TSA to say, please stop advertising what you're doing as a practical self-defense. If you want to have fun with lightsabers and invent your own rules for dueling, that's totally fine. But don't package it as a real practical fighting techniques. Because what you're doing is closer to LARPing than actual martial ar",the_rumblebee,cut my wrist

I've recently came across this article circulating among my circles, just wanted to start some interesting discussions with you guys.

http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/security-guard-jailed-10-years-for-killing-fiancee-by-trying-to/3544006.html

I'll impose some questions:

* What do you guys think of the pardoning of sentences by the courts due to mental illnesses?
* Do you think people like these should be treated equally as a completely sane individual?
* How do you feel about the sentencing of this case?

Personally, I myself am surprised that he got only 10 years. What happens if he repeats the crime again after serving his jail time? Maybe IMH might deserve some benefit of the doubt by being able to suppress his mental illness, but still, there is no absolute way of saying he wouldn't revert after he is released. By the way, after you read the article, I don't understand how it was ""brief"" psychotic disorder, it totally wasn't brief at all.

Maybe serious crimes like murder shouldn't be treated any differently whether you are a sane person or not. Either way, you had the intentions to kill someone and that is enough to be a danger to the community. But I guess it begs the question, what is the level of crime would be considered serious?

I've been offered a job in Singapore, and I'm going to take the plunge and move out from Dubai. I've been to SG about 5 times in the last two years so I'm comfortable with navigating my way around the city, however I know it's going to be vastly different when I live there. What I'd like some insight on (besides everything I've read in the sidebar) is the following:

- Are there any good bank/credit card comparison sites where I can weigh the pros and cons of certain bank accounts? btw, not looking for international remittances/USD accounts if that makes any difference.
- Are there any unspoken rules when it comes to work etiquette that you think don't exist elsewhere?
- I'm not coming in on a fancy expat relocation package, so is there anything I should be on the lookout for? I'll be getting an EP. 
- If I move, I'll bring clothes, my personal electronics, some books, etc. Anything else other newcomers don't consider bringing but wish they had?
- Also, I have stupidly bright rainbow-coloured hair. It's been kind of okayed by the guys I'll be working with (by ""kind of okayed"", I mean I went in for a series of interviews with them and they didn't object). My job will have some client-facing time, so will this raise eyebrows in a corporate environment? Are there good hair salons you'd recommend that know how to work with crazy colours, especially with people who have naturally dark hair?
- I'm not looking to come to Singapore, live for a few years, and then leave. I do seriously see myself settling down there for several reasons. Do you have any tips that can help me assimilate? I don't want to live in a little cushy expat bubble and only hang out with people who have the same background as I because that defeats the purpose of moving anywhere, tbh.

I am visiting Singapore for 2 weeks together with my mom (Who gave me the journey as a christmas/birthday gift)
I myself am a 27 year old dude from Copenhagen, Denmark. We love to travel I dare say! 
And I have a few questions I hoped some of you people might be able to answer & help me with.

First of all, we have been talking about going on a day trip to Malaysia in hopes of some cheaper and more authentic shopping (We like everything authentic and handmade) not looking for brands or anything like that.
Is it something any of you could reccommend, and if so what would be the way to go about it, and which destinations in malaysia would be relevant to aim for?
I would personally love to rent a scooter somewhere to cruise around but I wouldn't feel safe in the big traffic of singapore.

Another thing we would love to do is to visit the Marina Bay hotel to get a good view of the city from the top of the platform. I've read that the pool unfortunately is off-limits to non-guests but maybe its ok to just hang around for dinner or a cocktail or two? If anyone knows about other good view locations that are simular it would be neat as well.

As for any wildlife/nature experiences I would love to hear what people think is worth doing. So far we are planning to hike the trails through/above? some of the jungle still left in Singapore but any recommendations would be welcome.  

For 2 days now we have already been around some of the local hawker food courts, and I must say that they are really impressive for the price they are offering. But It seems that everytime we find a new food court/market they always have kind of the same options. Are there any other cool foodie places that we should visit?

I guess that was all I could think of from the top of my head. Any feedback or recommendations are highly welcome and I look forward to reading them.
If there is anything else you might want to add, please let me know! We don't have our trip tightly planned so we are open for most suggestions.


Maybe one more thing! Chinese new years, how is that gonna play out? Will it be with carnivals through the streets, sea side fireworks, partying all over or maybe even a combination of these? I am very excited about celebrating 2 new years on 1 year and would also love to go out for some party atleast for one night before I get home.

I used to be so driven and set lofty goals but lately I just feel so jaded and disillusioned with everything. 

Took the first job offer that paid the most right out of uni (banking / consulting etc, don't wish to be too specific). Had a terrible 5-6 months there of late nights and the excessive stress caused me to turn to anti-depressants.

I cracked and resigned, telling myself I will take up an ""in-between stress-free"" job somewhere and continue finding something I like. I'm currently working on my ""in-between"" job and applying furiously to every opening I can see.

A Singaporean kid's thoughts and troubles,35,2lgoo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2lgoo8/a_singaporean_kids_thoughts_and_troubles/,36,2014-11-07 02:45:25,"Hi, i'm fairly new to reddit and especially to this sub, so I hope nothing similar had already been posted..
Singapore had all along been labelled as a stressful and competitive country, and i think we all as Singaporeans know it's true. I just want to provide some troubles and thoughts i have about the education and living here..

First of all, schooling itself is already a big competition. I think we all know how stressful students who gone through the PSLE were, especially the ridiculous expectations from parents and the stereotype about 'neighborhood' schools from the society. And we are not yet talking about O level (or N level), something which i have not personally experienced and thus not daring to comment anything about it, but i already know how tough and stressful it is going to be. However, this isn't really my point.

As a Singaporean student, we spend at least 6-7 of hours in school per day. And then we start to add up co-curricular activities, one could easily be spending 11-12 hours in school, twice or thrice a week. The rest of the days in a week where we get to be released in the afternoon (say 2 or 3pm), it will (quite often) be taken up by supplementary classes, meetings or consultations with teachers. After all these, we come back home at night, and will then be faced with piles of homework which are expected to be done in a short span of time. There are also tuition classes arranged by parents often.

Recently, all these things has really been taking it's toll on me. I start to find myself lacking time to even relax or take a breather. I find myself lacking time to get a life, chat with friends, meet up and hang out, or even get to do things i like. I start to lose joy in life.. If at this age i'm already feeling so overloaded by these things, i can't imagine how i can face it when i grow up.. Eventually i'll reach a point where I have to use results to compete for seats in a local university. Things are highly priced over here, we can work 10-20 years to fully pay for an apartment, not to mention fighting for jobs, feeding a family, and the list goes on..

But back to the topic, Singapore's education may be one of the best, but at the midst of it, i've felt so much stress, competition and suppression, to the extent that life kind of lost it's meaning for me. I no longer get to relax, enjoy and live my life, and judging and hearing on what is going to come when i grow up, i do not think i will get to relax, enjoy and live my life in the near future either. So then, what is the point of living my life? 

Even though not everyone have the same views about this, i am pretty sure some people would feel the same way as me (from talking to friends, families and so on).

Thanks for the comments clarifying on the official reasons given for the removal of the license, it is true that rules were broken with overcrowding and not properly closing all doors/windows. However, the root of the problem is still there 

For some context, I'm a musician. While my training is classical, I've always been interested in various genres and especially love Jazz.

This week/month is a deeply saddening one for the arts/jazz community of Singapore. It's just been announced that Blu Jaz Cafe, one of the last standing venues for jazz, poetry slam, stand-up and amateur music community development will be having their Public Entertainment License taken away. This means no more live music, no more live performances etc. It will essentially become just any other bar.

This is following a series of many other such jazz bars closing down within close proximity of each other. 2 years ago, an amateur or professional musician who wanted to practice at a jam session could do so at B28, Artistry Cafe, Sing Jazz Club and Blu Jaz. Plenty of choices. That slowly reduced to only Blu Jaz. Every jam session at those other venues basically had to relocated to Blu Jaz. As a musician delving into jazz, jam sessions were a crucial part of the week for me to not only improve my craft, but also to engage with other jazz enthusiasts.

After this month, there may no longer be a venue that holds jam sessions anymore. While I have been mainly talking about the music side of things, it is important to note that this is part of a bigger movement that is, to me, the reason why art in Singapore is being prevented from growth. Personally, I think we are in a fantastic time for creating Singaporean art. From what I can see, we are hungry for local content. But in any artistic community, there needs to exist platforms and opportunities for such art to be created.

The importance of such casual venues cannot be overstated. The fact is that the rates of Singapore's performance venues, say the Esplanade, is actually greater than our competition, say New York or London. (Don't have a link to a stat for this, but I heard Huzir Sulaiman of Checkpoint Theatre mention this during a panel discussion in regards to the Arts Landscape of Singapore just a few days ago).

As an Artist, no matter where in the world you are, it will feel like an uphill battle. In Singapore, however, it feels more like trying to walk up a vertical wall. To throw in some statistics, the arts industry here is roughly twice as educated as the national median, yet our median pay is lower than the national average. Which is fine! Most of us accept the fact that we will adopt ""struggling to make ends meet"" not just temporarily, but as an entire lifestyle. All we want is to have adequate platforms to present and develop our art without having to be born from a rich family.

As an example, some of the biggest names in the jazz scene of Singapore has been running something called We Love Jazz SG. They've done some fantastic fantastic things in growing the community and really reaching out to audiences. However, they are about to shut down since they have been running on at least $20,000 in debt. This is despite being registered as a charity organisation and receiving grants and donations. The costs of doing art in Singapore, especially if you are less commercial (as compared to MBS theatre shows for example) is quite unbearable. The founders of WLJ  SG have been sustaining this venture from their own personal funds, but of course no matter how passionate we are, in the end money matters.

Now, why do I say I feel hopeless? I really don't want this to be a ""fuck the gahmen"" ranty post so I will try my best to be objective. Firstly, the circumstances surrounding the shutting down of Blu Jaz's live music simply feels like the ones who made the decision just don't care about how this affects the arts scene. So the basis of the removal is that the newly built condo opposite the road made noise complaints. Fair enough. In other countries, say Germany and London (since I will be giving anecdotal accounts, I apologize in advance for the lack of more solid research to back my opinions), if noise is an issue. There will be a process to solving this because those countries recognize the importance of arts and culture.

You will find that many live entertainment bars in these areas that are near residences may, for example, end live music very strictly at 12am. They might try to incorporate sound proofing. This is because there is a process of communication, instead of a black-and-white ""it's too loud"", there are steps taken to resolve the issue in a way that benefits everyone. In the case of Blu Jaz, there's no ""Stop the music at 12am or 10pm"". Nope, not even music at 2pm is ok now. There's now ""maybe let's explore a probation month to allow time for sound proofing, since the complaints are from the other side of the road after all"". Nope. It's a direct removal of the license with very little warning, and just like that we lose one of our last standing locations for so many great arts activities.

Now I'm sure the same would not happen if the noise complaint was made about Esplanade instead. Why is this so? My personal belief is that it is because our policy makers look at the Arts in an overly tangible and ""let's see what the numbers say"" manner. Random stat: in 2013 the total operating receipts in the Arts of Singapore amounted to roughly 7 billion SGD. What this means is that niche genres such as Jazz is ultimately just a rounding off error. Will that 7 billion change significantly the following year, if an important jazz bar is closed down? Probably not. So if you look at the numbers you can say, ""well arts is still doing great!""

But perhaps it is the very intangibility of arts and culture, and the fact that it is beyond what numbers can tell us, that makes it so important to Singapore. Ever thought of what the Singaporean identity is? And this is why I feel hopeless. I don't foresee this to change. The public complains loudest about foreigners and how much ministers are paid. Arts practitioners are a very tiny community in Singapore, so our voice doesn't get heard as much amidst the complaints of MRT breaking down and ""foreigners stealing our jobs"". PAP won't talk about the arts in their rallies, and neither will the opposition. I feel very useless as an individual because I can't seem to create the slightest change in the very thing that drives my being.

In fact, if this was brought up in front of the vocal online public, chances are that we will only get more hate. Cause they'll soon point out that many of the key leaders in Singapore's arts scene are foreigners (personally I consider most of them local already, and if anything they do more for Singapore than many Singaporeans). But why do you think there are so many foreigners? It's because we don't have the adequate environment for local talent to grow sufficiently, and in the end it's really just a vicious cycle. Today, I just asked a prominent local musician (who came from overseas many many years ago) if she would like to do an interview in regards to the jazz scene. First thing she said was that I should probably get a Singaporean instead. I feel very ashamed and sad when I heard that. I myself came from China, and when I was in school I was bullied a lot. One of my deepest memories is still this moment when I was being called ""China Monkey"" and prodded and provoked till I lashed out... which probably was the reaction they wanted to prove them right that I'm an uncultured, barbaric China Monkey.

Ok I've been ranting a lot. But I love Singapore and I don't want to just rant and not try to offer anything. As hopeless as I feel, I will still do my best to keep fighting for our arts scene. So what can we do to change this? To be honest, I don't think I have enough experience and knowledge to answer this adequately. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will be able to expand more on this.

First, from my own side, I guess I need to try and be more vocal about such issues, try and reach out to the public more. Hence making this post in the first place. Sometimes we tend to be caught in our own bubble of art making.

More push towards unionised support. There have been some advancements in this over the past few years, but it is definitely not enough. The whole Blu Jaz thing is because we don't have an official body to fight such issues for us. To the policy maker, it probably looks like ""Condominium with rich residents VS random noisy bar"", instead of what the bar actually represents -- one of the last stands of the jazz community. We need lawyers who can look at the fine print and argue it out with the governing boards to seek for solutions that aim for a mutually beneficial solution, not black and white ones that completely neglect one side of the argument.

While there was the formation of the Musician's Guild and NAC is also currently working on a sort of union for freelancers (albeit targeted at coaches and instructers only), it's definitely not enough because the numbers are too different. Such a thing would only be effective if pushed by the government themselves, if they care enough about the development and survival of arts. Everytime I see a presentation by NAC, they love to emphasise how much money the government puts into arts. While it is fantastic that we have great financial support, I believe the support is going to a lot of the wrong places. Most of the spending comes in the form of architecture. We seriously have some fantastic arts venues, such as the Esplanade. But spending on architecture will only benefit the local arts scene so much. If anything, Esplanade is an extremely difficult venue for local artists to perform in due to the exhorbitant costs. A non-profit organisation (if you are an individual artist or group without an organisation, it's even more) has to pay around 2 to 3 thousand for one night in the Esplanade Recital Studio, which holds around 200 people. Of course, the top arts groups in Singapore will still profit from this, but any mid-tier group/artist will have troubles even breaking even.

And that's the thing. I believe one way to seriously improve the arts scene is the creation of more opportunities for amateur/semi-pro artists. We need venues that didn't cost hundreds of millions to build and charge rates that pose a huge barrier of entry for any artist. Most artists who do hold concerts and such apply for grants from NAC to cover costs, but I believe this can result in a very skewed showcase of personalities. (The kind of proposals that would be accepted are... let's say, almost formulaic. A fantastic artist who perhaps does not command the strongest English or proposal writing skills is heavily disadvantaged, which should not be the case)

So yes, I think my whole rant starting with Blu Jaz boils down to barrier to entry. The closing down of Blu Jaz's music signifies a larger change in terms of increasing barriers to entry. This skews the kind of audiences that participate in the arts, and is ultimately a lose-lose situation for both the audience and the artist.

To end off, I shall use a personal anecdote as an example of how this ""barrier to entry"" affects things in my life. If I were to fly to Shanghai right now, I would immediately be able to perform in a bar at night (of course I have some connections lah) and have a healthy audience of both fans/friends and new audiences. In Singapore, if I want to perform, it will take me perhaps 2 months of planning (I'm not a vocalist, so it will be less straightforward). In the Shanghai scenario, the bars would be happy to have me and I would be paid an honorarium and probably in free drinks too. In Singapore, I will have to spend a few days on my excel sheets figuring out how much money I will stand to lose... Yes, performing here often costs the performer more than whatever each individual audience is spending. Blu Jaz has been a great venue for performance and they offer opportunities such as ""performers can book the private floors for free as long as the audiences buy XXX amount in drinks, they can choose to charge entry fees as well to pay Blu Jaz afterwards if the drinks sales don't meet the number"".

Thank you very much for the ones who actually read through this lengthy post, I'm sorry it's quite messy cause I'm typing this out on a whim. I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

About SG youtubers/content creators,150,85asss,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/85asss/about_sg_youtuberscontent_creators/,159,2018-03-19 03:57:18,"First of all, to get it out of the way, I probably haven't watched any SG youtubers recently, or in the last few months. I am basing this mainly on my memory in the past. When I realised this, I thought about why they are not well appreciated. So this is mainly a thread to discuss on what they can improve.

Second, I don't want to BM them. I really want our local youtubers to improve on what they are doing, because they are among the few that are actually producing content.

Ok to the main topic.

SG youtubers seem to have a ridiculous penchant for following set formulas. The ""X ways to do Y"" comes to mind, and I seriously think following this is either restrictive or overreaching, depending on scenario, to come up with a set number of ideas. Even coming up with some random number like 17 is not good, since there isn't a need to label each of your idea with a number. This isn't a statistics table, if I wanted to read numbers in a video I'll be looking at some science stuff.

Also, the titles are always clickbaity - which the core demographic probably isn't going to fall for. Most of the people imo that falls for clickbait are the older generation. My generation isn't likely going to fall for this kind of excuse of a title - especially with so much good content out there. So the clickbait isn't really necessary in most cases anyway.

Other than that, the main arguments I see for SG youtubers being bad is because of them being ""uncreative"" which I find it to be true - the follow a formula doesn't really work for the entertainment industry, at least not this way. I rarely recall anything resembling original content, what comes to mind are Jace Phua's skits and one random video about two secret agents, one professional and one newbie, getting an item, but they face problems because the newbie had to take a dump.

So, here are my suggestions.

My first example is JianHao Tan. As the SG Nigahiga, I never felt even compelled to watch his videos. The real Ryan Higa is a enigmatic, interesting individual, with his crazy outlandish ideas that works because he is him. Dong Saya Dae, The Cardboard, The Last Skitzo are among the best videos I have seen, and this really highlights the differences in their characters. JianHao feels like an edgy teenager trying to be Nigahiga, at least to me, and the drama around him makes it feel that way more. What makes them so different is how they portray themselves, which is noticably different, which can change a lot.

Next example is ideas. I disagree that SG youtubers are totally non creative. If I recall correctly, Jace Phua is probably one of the few people that made skits that are martial arts based in nature (and has their degree in comedy), while cheokboardstudio is pretty decent ignoring a few cringefest. However, I don't recall much creativity and I'm calling out WahBanana on this. After the loss of Elliot and co, they seem to default back to mostly ""X ways to do Y"", with a few standout episodes otherwise, and those are the better ones. The ones with more success, why not just let those ideas flow? They were pretty good, compared to the standard fare of overdone ideas.

Last thing I want to talk about is the cast. For this, I'm using NightOwlCinematics. I literally don't care for any characters besides Xi Gui Ong. But this can change drastically if the cast is more dynamic rather than so one dimensional, pushing for a character style, with an even bigger problem with such similiar styles. The obvious example is Smosh/Smosh games, but I don't even have to look across the border to find Malaysian youtubers that play it pretty well. But the better example, Smosh, has set character dynamics and they just play it off so well. The main people to talk about is Damien Haas, who is so expressive as the joker or troll, who even stands out among the rest of Smosh, who each can stand extremely well on their own. Meanwhile, NightOwlCinematics has Xi Gui Ong the watermelon head bullied kid, Lobang the ah long archetype and about 3 ah lians. I don't think anything else stands out, even though I was an avid fan a few years back.

The last thing I want to bring up is not a youtuber, but a movie series. Ah boys to men is honestly a great idea, showing NS life, even though it tends to drift into a noticeable amount of subplots (Honestly the film works better if they focused on the full comedy, rather than the actual main plot), but either way it is pretty good. Ah boys to men 2 was a decent conclusion to a good movie. Ah boys to men 3 is iffy, but ok, they had success and wanted to try a different angle. Ah boys to men 4 was beating a dead horse. Jack Neo has produced pretty good films, why not try something new, considering how well his ideas tend to work, rather than working a franchise to its death?

TLDR: Discussion on how youtubers in SG can improve, with examples using other youtubers worldwide

Preface: If after reading part 1 and part 2, you still have more questions, feel free to pm me. I'll be glad to answer whatever questions I can. I check this account once every few days. 

This post is an in-depth look at the firefighting and rescue side of SCDF. It is inspired by the lack of firefighting-centric drama based in Singapore (with the exception of the DART-focused drama “Mooncake” that received so little marketing I didn’t even know it existed until I drafted this post), and also by the surprising lack of knowledge that the public has on the capabilities and job scope of firefighting and rescue personnel in SCDF. The entire post will be looking at it mostly from the perspectives of a fire side personnel.

Part 1 (here) will present information about SCDF, while [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4yislg/indepth_look_at_scdfs_fire_and_rescue_side_part_2/) will be the FAQ.

I don’t pretend this is a fantastic Holy Grail for making decisions, nor do I pretend everything here is 100% accurate. In fact, I have done some filtering to make sure no one gets into any form of trouble.

Inside, you will find general information on SCDF. For impending recruits, those who intend to sign on, or members of public interested in the inner workings of SCDF, in-depth information on select different departments in SCDF and training are also available. 

A part of the post will be formatted as an FAQ. Hopefully this will give better context to the information. 

I must disclaim that this is **not** sanctioned by our Public Affairs Department, and I should not expect it will ever be, as it touches on some, well, touchy topics. My views *do not* represent the views of the Public Affairs Department, my fellow colleagues, the NSFs working under me, my direct superiors and higher management, or the Singapore Civil Defence Force itself. Obviously, I am posting this on a throwaway account to make sure I cannot be identified. 

Before I go on, I must explain that despite the Force’s shortcomings, I am proud to be in SCDF, and I truly have faith in SCDF to be able to handle the incidents that we are trained for. 

The first section will be a glossary of words and phrases that SCDF uses. This is non-exhaustive, and certain terms (such as FSM) are intentionally left out as they may not be immediately relevant to the people who would find this post useful.

**Glossary**

* Appliance: SCDF term for vehicles.

* ASCC: Advance Section Commander Course. 10 day course that trains Section Commanders in more complex incidents (like escalator rescue). Following the course, personnel will be conferred the title “Section Commander I”.

* BA: Breathing apparatus. Usually refers to the entire BA cylinder mounted on a backplate that allows you to wear it like a backpack. Weighs 12.7kg and, on paper, allows personnel to breathe for 30 to 45 minutes.

* Baris: Commonly used to refer to scenario drills.

* BRT: Basic Rescue Training. The equivalent of BMT for SAF. It is a 10-week stay-in course where recruits learn basic rescue techniques, and how to operate basic rescue equipment.

* BTF: Basic Task Force. The initial fleet of vehicles responding to an incident.

* BTM: Basic Task Manuals. These are fundamental tasks which are timed that a section has to complete. These range from pitching a ladder, setting up two firefighting jets, etc.

* CA: Chemical agents. Frequently associated with terrorist attacks in SCDF context.

* Callsigns: The shorthand names for every vehicle in the frontlines. See below for explanation.

* CBRE: Collective term referring to the following substances: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives. 

* CDA: Civil Defence Academy. It is located beside NSTI, and is considered a separate entity from it. It provides specifically firefighting and rescue training for those selected to cross over to the fire side.

* Commander Fire Station (CFS): The equivalent of a Commanding Officer in SAF. CsFS work on office hours in the 21 fire stations in Singapore, but are standby 24/7 for any major incidents. In essence, they can be called up at any time (even in the middle of the night) for as long as they hold the position of CFS (usually around 2 years). Some people use the term OC instead, which was the term used before “CFS” was used.

* CPL: Combined Platform Ladder. One of the most common vehicles behind PLs and LFs. It consists of a 30m ladder mounted on a boom, which is on the back of the vehicle. It can reach up to 10 storeys vertically, but for operations considerations we limit it to 8 storeys.

* DART: Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team. They are the commando-equivalent in SCDF and specialize away from firefighting into different types of rescue (although they are also well-versed in firefighting), such as USAR, confined space rescue and height rescue. These are the people rappelling down from the roof when there is a suicide incident. Attaining a DART specialist tag is the highest prestige in SCDF.

* Division: A shortened version of the phrase “divisional headquarters”. SCDF is split into four divisions, each headed by a station (see section “Basic Information of SCDF”). Division refers to these four fire stations.

* Deputy Rota Commander (DRC): A junior officer who has risen up the ranks enough to be at least a WO2, and appointed to be a DRC. He is the encik in the Rota. The overwhelming majority of the time, the DRC will have at least 10 years of service under his belt before being appointed to be a DRC. He is the real boss behind a Rota, unless he chooses to relinquish his command to the RC (who is more often than not a new officer who has just posted out from training and has very little experience and commanding prowess). 

* DO: Duty Officer. Versatile term used to describe different things. It can refer to the RC on duty, the ground commander of a scenario drill. When used as part of the phrase “DO pump”, it refers to the fire engine that the RC is manning while on duty.

* EAS: Emergency Ambulance Services. This term is deprecated and has been replaced by the term “EMS”.

* EMS: Emergency Medical Services

* ERS: Emergency Response Specialist. Term is used interchangeable with Section Commanders, but usually only referring to regulars.

* ETF: Enhanced Task Force. The secondary fleet of vehicles responding after the BTF if reinforcements are required and/or the incident is confirmed.

* EV4A: The emergency vehicle license granted that allows you to drive ambulances.

* EV4F: The emergency vehicle license granted that allows you to drive vehicles with firefighting capabilities (i.e PLs and LFs).

* FI: Fire Investigation. Refers to the entire process of investigating the cause of a fire. Fire reports will have to be put up for all fires categorized higher than the C2 category (see below for explanation). 

* Fire side: Refers to all personnel in the firefighting and rescue part of SCDF.

* FFC: Firefighter Course. 3-month course where recruits train to be Firefighters. Firefighters can hold the rank of PTE, LCP or CPL.

* FRS: Fire Rescue Specialist. This is a legacy term that has been deprecated and replaced by “ERS”.

* HQ: Refers to SCDF headquarters, located at Ubi. It is co-located with Paya Lebar Fire Station and DART base (see “DART”).

* HRI: High risk installation. Every station’s boundary will have multiple HRIs (central having the most if I am not mistaken). There are different categories of HRIs, such as due to housing occupants with limited mobility, storage of chemicals, high occupancy load, etc.

* HTTC: Home Team Tactical Centre. There are advanced simulators there to provide realistic training for personnel. HTTC is located near the soon-to-be-demolished MTV.

* Injects: Ad-hoc changes made to a scenario drill while it is ongoing to make it more difficult. Common ones are water supply down, SCDF personnel down, etc. 

* LF or LFAV: Light Fire Attack Vehicle. Refers to the red rhinos.

* Matra: Refers to the comms set that all frontliners (fire side and EMS) use for communications with Ops Center and with each other.

* MTE: Minimum Term of Engagement. Regulars who sign on with SCDF prior to completing their national service (with any organization) will have to fulfil a 5-year bond, known as the MTE. 

* MTV: Mandai Training Village. A small village located along Mandai Road where training for pump operation, CPL and emergency vehicle licenses are conducted.

* NCO: Non-commissioned officer. Versatile term used to describe different things. It can refer to the DRC on duty, and when used as part of the phrase “NCO pump”, it refers to the fire engine (which is treated as the secondary fire engine going out for less important calls) that the DRC or a regular is commanding while on duty. 

* NSTI: National Service Training Institute. It is located beside CDA, and is considered a separate entity from it. It provides basic training such as foot drills and basic rescue techniques for new recruits.

* PA: Private Ambulance. SCDF has arrangements with private ambulance companies for them to provide their services.

* PAO: Private Ambulance Operators. Refers to private ambulance personnel. They do not hold ranks, and while generally bound by most sweeping rules (no smoking, etc), they are mostly accountable to their companies, not to SCDF.

* PL or pumper or pump: Refers to Pump Ladder, the classic, big fire engines.

* PPE: Personal protective equipment. Refers to the attires that protect us from injuries and other debilitating conditions while we work. (see FAQ for the common types of PPE that SCDF uses)

* PTP: Physical Training Phase. A 3-months phase where recruits who fail to get at least a silver for NAPFA prior to enlistment are trained up in preparation for BRT and possible further training.

* RCC: Rota Commander Course. It is a 9-month (heard it has been shortened; can anyone confirm the actual duration now?) course. The course includes training on fitness, firefighting, rescue, hazmat and relevant knowledge in these areas. Personnel will be conferred the title “Rota Commander”.

* Rota: The equivalent of a platoon in SCDF. Fire stations are manned 24/7 by 3 Rotas, which works out to a 24-48 shift (work one day, off two days). 

* Rota Commander (RC): These are the senior officers attached to a Rota, and will oversee its operations every duty. They report directly to the Commander Fire Station.

* SCC: Section Commander Course. 6-month course (apparently duration has been shortened marginally; can anyone confirm the actual duration now?) training recruits and regulars to become Section Commanders. The course includes training on fitness, firefighting, rescue, hazmat and relevant knowledge in these areas. Personnel will be conferred the title “Section Commander II”.

* Turn out: The SCDF version of the word “dispatch” or vehicle (see “Appliance”). This can be used as a verb, to refer to responding to a call, or as a noun, to refer to a particular incident or a vehicle.

* USAR: Urban Search and Rescue.

**Basic Information of SCDF**

SCDF provides firefighting, rescue and hazardous materials (henceforth referred to as hazmat) management capabilities at its heart. Frontliners turn out for the following calls:

* Rubbish chute fires
* Central divider fires on expressways or roads
* Vegetation fires
* Unit fires in residential areas
* Chemical fires
* Factory and warehouse fires
* Suicide calls
* Calls involving entrapment (e.g locked doors, person trapped in small places, etc)
* Calls involving toxic industrial chemicals requiring investigation or mitigation
* Calls involving release of chemical agents requiring investigation mitigation

SCDF also turns out for other miscellaneous, not-as-urgent calls:

* Body retrieval
* Oil/cement/blood/concrete spillage cleanup
* Investigation of fire alarm systems (which may or may not lead to the discovery of an actual fire; majority of the time it’s a false alarm)
*  Unexploded bombs

**The Four Divisions**

The four SCDF divisions comprise of 21 fire stations. 1st Division covers the western and central areas, 2nd Division covers the eastern areas, 3rd Division covers the northern areas, while 4th division covers the western and north-western areas. Division headquarters are in bold. Fire stations with hazmat capabilities are marked with a “(H)”.

1st Division:

* 11: Central

* **12: Alexandra (H)**

* 13: Clementi

* 14: Jurong Island (H)

* 15: Bishan

* 16: Banyan (H)

* 17: Marina Bay

* 18: Sentosa

2nd Division:

* 21: Paya Lebar

* **22: Tampines (H)** 

* 23: Changi

3rd Division:

* **31: Yishun**

* 32: Ang Mo Kio

* 33: Seng Kang

4th Division:

* 41: Jurong

* 42: Tuas (H)

* 43: Woodlands

* **44: Bukit Batok**

* 45: Tuas View (H)

Marine Command:

* 81: West Coast

* 82: Brani

Other than that, we also have other active units that are not directly under the jurisdiction of the four divisions.

* CDA: 51

* NSTI: 61

* DART: 91

* HQ: 99

**Categories of Fire**

Below you will find categories of fire. The criteria listed is not exhaustive, and contains only those that we frequently use (read: I am not familiar with the more obscure criteria).

* A (3 or more people injured or involvement of death)

* B (lesser than 3 people injured)

* C1 (damage to property of at least $50)

* C2 (damage to property of less than $50)

These are then further categorized into accidental or incendiary causes. All accidental fires of category C1 and above require a report, as do all incendiary fires.

**Callsigns**

The easiest way to understand callsigns is to use examples. 

PL421: PL refers to the vehicle, which is a pump ladder. The numbers 421 means that it is the first pump ladder from station 42, which is Tuas Fire Station.

PL182: Again, PL refers to the vehicle being a pump ladder. The numbers 182 means that it is the second pump ladder from station 18, which is Sentosa Fire Station.

LF211: LF refers to the vehicle, which is a red rhino. The numbers 211 means that it is the first rhino from station 21, which is Paya Lebar Fire Station.

**Light Fire Attack Vehicle**

Our LFAVs, known to the public colloquially as red rhinos, are unique to Singapore. 

Fire engines (SCDF equivalent: pump ladder) around the world have their own water tank. SCDF pump ladders hold 2.4k litres of water. This ensures that we can always set up our firefighting jets (which is more dependent on personnel skill, technique and fitness) without being held back by having to set up your water supply first (which is more dependent on your location and general uluness of the place).

LFAVs do not have any water tanks. Older generations of LFAVs have a 50/55 litre water tank for our water mist gun. It has since been replaced by the CAF backpacks in the LF 4G and LF 5G (and therefore the newer vehicles do not have a water tank at all).

I realise that my tone kind of smudged what I really wanted to say, but nonetheless I've been receiving invaluable advice. I'll try to work on not coming across as a dick to others (welp). It's been a rough 3 and a half years indeed, but I'll put my head up high and work for the best. Thanks y'all. 



sorry if I'm not supposed to post this kind of post, will take down at mods' request. using a throwaway so that I don't accidentally doxx myself. sorry for horrendous phrasing/expressions, I'm not in the best frame of mind. 

Oh boy, where do I start? 

I'm a sec 4 express student taking the o's this year. 15M from a single sex secondary school somewhere in central (?) Singapore. 

I regretted joining this school from the very moment that I entered it's code as a 2nd choice for secondary school admission. those elusive 4 marks in my t-score were to change my life for the next 4 years, for the worst. 

I didn't brace myself enough for Sec 1. I was from a school environment whereby insulting/name-calling wasn't entertained within the student cohort itself. But here, it seemed to be a fucking class - no, level - tradition. The amount of insults and bullying I received in the first two years.. fucking hell. (to put things into perspective, I am an overweight guy who used to be emotional - to the point of crying - during my first two years in that school). 
they were so dedicated to bullying me that they created whatsapp groups to spew all sorts of shit about me. new insults about my family members, offensive memes, etc. 

somehow made some good friends, they fell to the dark side and turned against me. Oh boy was that fun to go through. all my personal stuff being thrown out in the open and used against me. 

tldr: it was a royal clusterfuck of (insert other swear words here). 

at the end of secondary 2, I was so excited to leave this class. I had lost my chance(s) to contribute to my school (couldn't be a prefect since I didn't attend a prerequisite leadership course, didn't attend my UG cca's trainings regularly during Sec 1 and 2 and subsequently made myself unable to get any exco positions, didn't get anywhere near entering the class committee for both years). But whatever, new Sec 3/4 class, mostly new people to get to know, new friendships blah blah blah. No pure chem/phy for H2 at JC level? Isokay man, just get an A1 at O's for combined science and iz all gud.

I wanted to graduate from this school, being remembered for good things and whatever. 

Things haven't been going as planned, however. 

I easily socialised with many of the people in my new class. Found some cool people to get to know better. But over the course of my Sec 3 and even Sec 4 years, I started to distance myself from many people in my class. 

Conflicting interests? Maybe. 

Introversion? Seemed like it. 

I came to realise that I wasn't bad at socialising, I was actually pretty good at it, but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with. 

This didn't exactly serve me well. Many people in my class thought I was a stuck up piece of shit or something to that effect. 

I guessed that graduation wasn't going to be what I thought it would be. 

Apart from that, there were the handful of retards that took joy in making my life harder than it was. A few of the fuckers from my Sec 2 class, were unfortunately, smart enough to enter into my mid-tier class. Tried to curb my social life within my class and all that shit. And there's the others that thought that repeating my name in weird voices around and behind me would be so fucking hilarious. (for the record, I have a pretty uncommon name - uncommon enough to be made into a joke apparently. I even went to the extent of asking my parents to change my goddamn name, but to no avail so far). 

I started to develop a bad rep within a sizeable chunk cohort, even amongst people that I didn't know personally and vice versa.

I don't even know many of these fucking people and they made (and still are making) fun of me for things that I am and things that I'm not. 

all I want now is an L1R5 of >10, a place in my JC of choice (affiliated w/ my current school) and my teachers' appraisal. everything else can rightfully fuck off. 

No hate against this school tho, it's school culture is amazing and lives up to what it's termed (**[redacted]** - I think that's a big clue already haha). This same culture is imminent in the interconnected primary school, secondary school and JC, and that's why I want to continue my journey in the affiliated JC. 

In a way, these 3 and a half years of hell have been beneficial. I came to learn about my true psychological/socio-emotional limits, learnt about different types of people, learnt how to discern between good people and bad ones.

How do I get around a bad job reference from a bullying boss?,191,8773ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8773ec/how_do_i_get_around_a_bad_job_reference_from_a/,46,2018-03-26 22:43:44,"Last week, I signed an offer letter for a new job and was going to throw my resignation letter next week. However, I think I might end up with no job now. The new company just called me up and asked me when I would submit the resignation letter, so they can call up my HR for a reference check.

The very same HR who is my manager's relative and relys solely on my biased manager for information since she is not in the office.

My organization suffers from a high turnover rate despite our small size of less than 10 employees. I'm the 4th person to be in my role in as many years and have already outlasted all my predecessors at just over a year here.

The manager and senior colleagues (who are a clique) have had nothing good to say about all the female predecessors and all of the praises for the one guy who worked here, even though past records show that the ladies were pulling their weight while the guy did the bare minimum and left after 5 months. 

There is a high probability of the manager outright bad-mouthing me because I politely refused some of the more unreasonable demands (e.g. excessively taking on the daily workload of said senior colleagues and herself because ""at this age, they aren't familiar with the Internet and you should respect your seniors"") when I'm overworked. She has been passive aggressive towards me ever since.

She's the only in-charge since we are a small organization and the board relys solely on her for information. 

For context, some of you might have seen my previous post about my dilemma in the current job. In short, it's an exploitative environment with a toxic work culture with rampant bullying and shady dealings.

Should I inform the new HR to crosscheck again my current company's  glassdoor reviews/ratings (one star) and with my functioning colleague for a reference check because there might be biases at work due to my manager's way of doing things?

Or would it be seem too defensive?

I've previously been diagnosed with major depression and have stopped my medication and seeing my psych as I've gotten better.

However in recent days, things have been very bad. I went overseas with my family but every single moment of it was a torture for me. In the past when I was seriously suffering in my room, my mum knew but she just came in to check and simply walked away, it felt like he didn't care. My siblings know about my issue but they can't do much about it and I don't expect them to. They have their own families and I understand that they would come first. Now when I have problems, I have no one to turn to. I can't talk to my siblings like I don't even wanna tell them about it because they can't do anything and I no longer feel close with them anymore. as for my parents, they never did understand me and would never know.

I have a girlfriend, but I felt like I'm not doing her justice. When I see her I see a girl so deserving to be cared for, to be happy. I tried to give it to her but apparently I don't think I can. In fact I may be adding onto her burdens. I feel bad because other than her there's no one else I can turn to but it's not fair for her because I'm broken and I don't think I can be fixed. It'll suck but I'm going to talk to her and ask how she is, if she would be better off without me, I'll do it. For her sake. Sometimes when she pms she doesn't want to talk to me, when she has issues she doesn't want to approach me. I guess I ain't the correct person for her.

As for myself, I'm still studying and have visited school counsellors and external counsellors from clarity and have been receiving treatment at imh. I can't even be bothered about the social stigma anymore because I know I am broken and that I need help. I desperately want to become better but no matter how I try, it doesn't seem like it's getting better. I've called SOS so many times and talked to them but it all hasn't helped me. I ain't too close with my friends in school because honestly, none of them cares. 

This few days I've been struggling, I feel like I've been having my buttons pushed to my limit. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of breaking down, it's like a goddamn rollercoaster where I'm okay for 20min and sad for the next few hours trying to hold back my tears.

I would say that I'm a person who self-pity myself a lot. I want to be loved, to be cared but I just can't feel any of it coming from anywhere. I really want to get well and get back to normal but my treatment and counselling just can't help without support from those around me. My parents don't know what to do with me and my siblings just tell me to suck it up or that it'll get better and what I really hate the most is when all of them tell me that I need to walk out of it. I may be a little bit spoilt(maybe) but what I really want is just someone to be there but I can't find that person. Some of you may say, be glad your parents are still around and your siblings still talk but that's the thing. To me, it doesn't matter if they are or not. I don't feel anything from them. I want to recover, I want to walk out, but I don't know how.


Tldr: op self-pities and have tried all ways to recover but is still broken.

For those wondering, yes I have talked to my parents and they don't know what to do with me which I don't blame them because I know I'm a mess myself. For my siblings, I hate my brother so much because all he does is just aggravate my emotions and make me even more unstable. It's dark and it really sucks.

My experience with Shopee and their 11:11 sale,10,9zepmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9zepmr/my_experience_with_shopee_and_their_1111_sale/,14,2018-11-23 06:52:33,"I want to share my experience and worries with using Shopee for my purchases. Though the prices were good, everything else could have been done better. I placed orders for 5 things. A Nintendo Switch console, Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, a Poke Ball Plus and Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

For the console, since it wasn't a pre order item, I didn't expect it to take so long to arrive. I paid for it on 11 Nov and waited a couple of days. I messaged them on the 16th because they were also supposed to deliver the Pokémon games. They stated that the items ""will be sent out in 2-3 days"". I didn't get any news until the 21st when they messaged me that my Switch console is delivered, so yay for that. Even if it's a 10 day wait (not sure if it's normal) I'm glad I got my item. However, I still have yet to receive news about the games I've preordered.

For the Poke Ball Plus, I placed an order with another shop on shopee. With codes, coins and discounts, it's around $58, which was pretty cheap. For this shop however they told me on the 15th, that they have to click ""order shipped"" even if they did not ship anything. I was like, OK pretty shady, I hope I'm not over thinking. On the 22nd Nov, they messaged saying that they have to cancel the order. The prices now are about $85, so them pulling out on the customers dealt a huge blow.

With the above issue, that's where my worry comes from. I've placed orders on 5 items, 4 of which are pre orders. 3 of the pre order items are supposed to be available. 1 of them got canceled on me while I wait for the news for my 3 remaining games. If the 3 remaining suppliers pull off the exact same move as the other shop, I'm going to have a Nintendo Console without having any games.

TLDR; bought gaming console and games online. Everything took/is taking their time to come. One even cancelled (after the market price is $30 more now), so I'm worried if the other orders would do the same thing (and having to fork out even more for the games)

Questions that I have: Are the shops on shopee relatively reliable? Have anyone experienced shops backing out after they clicked on the website that they've ""shipped out"" the order? Since they already ""shipped out"" and told me that they are cancelling, am I supposed to click cancel or are they supposed to do so? Is there any repercussions in asking Shopee to cancel (asking because Grab penalizes user for cancelling and I'm afraid my money will be affected when I cancel)? If I ask Shopee for a refund, will they credit the amount back to my bank or will it be restricted just for their si",syadz0,better off without me

Im not sure if im doing the right thing posting here but I really hope someone can help me out on this.  I came back from Tampines just a while ago and as all folks who go to Tampines often would know, there's quite a number of tissue-selling elderly along the stretch from Tamp interchange to Tampines One. But today was the first time I saw this man; I noticed him because of the way he was moving. This man has a condition where his head is tilted to one side and he moves in a way in which his knees point out in a disturbingly awkward angle. I dont know the name of his condition but all I can say is that he stumbled really really badly everytime he took a small step and looked like he could collapse anytime. Everyone who walked past him were a bit shocked. My boyfriend and I as well as many others donated money but all of us did not know what else we could do. So im just wondering if there's any organization anyone knows we can refer him to. It felt really horrible to watch him struggle and be unable to help in better ways. This man here SHOULDNT BE WALKING AT ALL and not least without a walking aid yet there he was trying so damn hard in the middle of the bus interchange. It was really heartwrenching.

I feel a bit silly posting here because I dont even know his details and I dont know if im overreacting. But I just feel really emotional still and am just wondering if there's anyone who have any advice on what we can do to help him.

EDIT: Fellow Easties, if you have seen him before, please let me know what time/day it was. As suggested by a couple of users below, I’ll write a letter to the MP/ call up the social worker service to see if they can approach and help him. 

However, the one great fear I have is that yesterday was simply a one-off time he appeared in Tamp and that we won’t be able to find him and give him the help he needs. (I fear this because I’ve never seen him before despite living in Tamp virtually my whole life.) 

So, if you have seen him before, please please let me know the timing/day you saw him so that I can include these details in my letter and call!

Renting as a young Singaporean,213,8n6bor,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8n6bor/renting_as_a_young_singaporean/,131,2018-05-30 22:18:58,"I don't know any young Singaporean in my social circle that rents his or her own place. I know such people like myself exist, but we are few. So, here I am, to share my experience and also hope to get some tips and insights from others who have also done so, so that I could have a better time going off the beaten path.

I graduated from a local university about a year and a half ago, and until that point in time, it never crossed my mind that I should ever rent a place in Singapore. I was interested in studying overseas and for sure I would rent overseas. But at that time, to me my future in Singapore was to live with my parents until one day I departed Singapore or else chose to settle here and buy a house.

After I started working, my perspective quickly changed. It grew increasingly jarring to me that while I was then an adult, I was still blatantly living off my parents by living in the house and having cleaning and laundry managed for me. Also, I felt that by living in my childhood home, I was constraining my growth and would continue to remain my parents' little boy. So against the conventions of Singapore society, and the chains of CPF, I decided to move. I have only one life and I am young only once, so I decided to do what was best for me to help me to grow and become independent. It took some time to ponder, plan, and prepare, but sure enough, at the one year mark after graduation, I moved.

All my life I lived in the same HDB flat, and at last, at the ripe age of 26, I was moving.

I chose a common room in a condominium at Tanjong Rhu, living with other flatmates that I didn't know beforehand. My monthly rent and utilities add up to about SGD1K. I chose a condominium because I thought it would be more comfortable to live in, and there would also be greater privacy without the common corridors and void decks that HDB blocks have. Well, I no longer have to contend with noisy weddings and funerals, nor people knocking on my door and leaving flyers, but unfortunately, I have incessant noise throughout the day from the construction of a nearby MRT station, and noise from other flats and the community is still very much present.

Another consideration was the bad stories about HDB landlords that I read from expatriates online. You see, the situation in Singapore is unfavourable to tenants. Tenants frequently lose their security deposits, are forced to have minimum 6 month contracts each time they move, and frequently have to forgo the remainder of their 1\-2 year contract's worth of rent if they decide to move before their contract ends. The impression I got was that HDB landlords tend to be less proper and respectful of tenants' rights, and really only cared about securing additional income from their flats with minimal fuss. Perhaps I am wrong: if I am, let me know.

In the area where I live, for some reason the population is predominantly expatriate Indians. I feel quite misplaced over there considering it is Singapore, and yet, I was surrounded by foreigners, not merely foreigners but foreigners of one specific race. I always think of expatriates as bold, entrepreneurial individuals who dare leave their familiar society to enter another. That is something I respect. However, this situation is one of them aggregating with others of their kind rather than immersing into a different society. This is a puzzling situation and I still do not fully understand why, and why I feel this way. Whatever it is, it certainly makes me feel less and less attached to Singapore, and having a greater desire to go away.

Life was tough right after I moved. Having everything taken care of for me for all my life and needing only to focus on my studies, I was spoilt. Suddenly, I needed to spend a bulk of my weekend time doing laundry and cleaning. I had to learn simple things like choosing the number of towels to keep so that I had enough to rotate and the frequency of washing them, and when to wash them. I ironed my shirts at first but it was too time consuming and I switched to using a clothes steamer which cut the time by half. Maintaining a good degree of cleanliness was difficult at first, and by the time I got into a decent routine of cleaning my room and rotating my bed sheets, my dust allergy had acted up severely and I had to see a specialist for treatment.

I tried cooking at first, but after realising how much time it took, and frankly having no mood to cook and wash after a day at work, I readjusted my eating habits to make do with affordable yet reasonably healthy takeaway options. I became a frequent patron of salad stalls and fruit stands. I value my time a lot, and while I want to be independent, I don't want to be so frugal as to eat into time that I could otherwise spend pursuing my interests. I spend my time reading, learning language \(currently brushing up on my Chinese and starting on French at the end of this year\), and exploring mathematics and cognitive science problems. Having freedom does entail a good deal of responsibility too. Two and a half months back I fell into a severe period of computer gaming addiction after one year of abstinence, and I finally got my act together only a few weeks ago.

Now, half a year after moving, I feel like finally I am settling down and managing to get by. I look back, and think of my choice and sometimes wonder if it were better if I had stayed back at my parents' place. Although it has been a tough time in the past half a year, I believe I have grown a lot and at least I can be proud to say that I am living completely independently. I do hope things get better, and I look forward to how this stronger me will handle life in time to come.

My mom is a very vigilant person, sometimes borderline paranoid and so she asked the lady for the organisation she was from. The lady was quite evasive and didn't reply her question twice, until the third time instead of answering outright, she held up a card which my mom found immediately suspicious. Nor did she give her name which I thought was protocol? My mum said the lady spoke in a ""chao lin dai"" way, which meant she mumbled when she talked. My mom decided to not entertain her and wanted to close the door so the lady turned to interview my maid, who had opened the door, instead. 

My maid was very upfront with all the answers, and my mom even said she tried to show the lady my brothers' phone numbers which my mum has written in a notebook. 

Afterwards my mom created a big hoo-ha and told me to educate my maid about loansharks and scammers that had recently been featured in the news. I would have brushed it off but I thought she had a point, plus the phone numbers thing had to be drilled into her not to just give anyone who asked for it.

After questioning her, my maid revealed that the lady claimed to be from MOM and asked for her WP number, salary, bonus, no. of children. This is very weird because I ~~just~~ long time ago before the deadline filled up an online survey from MOM so why do they need to waste money to conduct an interview in person? And don't they usually send a letter to inform beforehand? There is also no way to verify the legitimacy of this person since ~~MOM hotline only for Mon-Fri~~ (Edit: There is a hotline for Mon-Sunday. I didn't know about this; sorry for the misinformation). So I think my maid indeed had been duped into giving out her details. I gave her a reminder not to trust anyone with such information next time. Maybe I'm paranoid too but better safe than sorry. I need to call MOM on Monday to verify if they did send someone down. Will update with the results. 

Tldr; lady claiming to be from MOM extracted info out of my helpful maid.

Edit;Update: Ok I called at the stroke of 8.30am and the officer who answered said that I had already completed the online survey. According to the system, there weren't any remarks about my survey being incomplete or needing any clarifications. She said she will bring up the matter with her supervisor to investigate and call me back with their findings. But she did mention that they will usually set an appointment with the interviewee before going down unless they cannot be contacted. They are taking this matter quite seriously. Lesson of the day, be vigilant and call on the spot to verify (It can be verified on Mon-Sun; I was wrong. Link for reference: http://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/MSOLHH.aspx). Educate your parents/maid about this. Also she didn't said outright but the emphasis on no photo ID on the card made me think that usually the ID card will have a photo, which my mom said there wasn't any. She also asked me to describe the card's appearance so that's something to take note of. Will update further details.

Further update: I received a call soon after my inquiry to MOM on Monday and the interview was actually a legitimate one, not scammer. Thank goodness. But she was not supposed to have come down to our house for the interview, because I had already completed it. The MOM officer (manager, iirc) apologised for the inconvenience and assurance that it would not happen again.

* Here is how the school charges in order to enforce attendance. $50 for attendees and $110 for non-attendees (Hello? If this isn't unethical I don't know what is)
* Under the pestering and pressure from the form teacher in 2017, most of the class submitted an edusave form to pay the attendance fee ($50). 
* Many of her classmates did not attend due to the abovementioned reason and now the school is demanding $60 extra for non-attendance or they will not receive their O level results slated to be released this Friday (12 Jan 2018)

This was what their form teacher sent in a group chat:
>dear children, a reminder to clear your debts (prom/sch fees) by this friday. you will not be given your results until outstanding matters are settled. pls don't put yourself in an unfavourable position this friday yea? see y'all!

She has not settled her payment and has consulted me on how she should proceed. I've sent an e-mail to MOE reporting this case, but it takes 3 working days for them to reply. Meanwhile, what can I do for her? Is this even ethical?

Thanks in advance. :)

TL;DR - School charging prom non-attendees $110 and attendees $50, sister paid $50 and did not attend. School charging $60 holding O level results hostage. What do?


**EDIT**: Called MOE highlighting the issue, customer service exec told me that the issue will be raised and I will be contacted directly by said school or the officer in charge of this matter.

**EDIT 2**: 8 Jan 2018 - A staff of Whitley Secondary School has contacted me in a very defensive manner. Phone call summary:


* The $60 (subsidised with attendance) was tied to an interview course (EAE has long ended, mind you.) prior to the prom for Sec 5s that was part of the student development program, making it compulsory to attend the prom anyways.
* Staff said that there are students who are exempted from the $60, but not $50 for non-attendance due to valid reasons. (I have learnt from my sisters several students went overseas just to avoid this payment, which was counted as a valid reason.)
* Staff said the programme outline and contact information was reflected on a form for queries that were issued to the parents. (My parents were not English educated)
* The withheld results are due to MOE policies to clear outstanding school fees etc. prom fees included
* Their form teacher gave them an ultimatum - $50 attend or $110 when you don't without explaining the extra $60, which seems like the teacher goaded them into attending since it's the 'cheaper' option. 
* My point is that they have conveyed to the school through the poll that they were not interested and very few secondary school students actually use e-mail or have the guts to contact another teaching staff. The students' primary point of contact is their form teacher, who did not do a very good job of communicating their dissatisfaction to the committee. 

*So no, all in all, no refunds intended or rescindment of the $60 intended. It was partially my sister's fault for not reading the fine print properly and interpreting it to my parents before signing the agreement form. I think the form teacher should also have done a better job of representing and protecting the students. If they had the choice to not attend - they won't.*


**EDIT 3**: 10 Jan 2018 - My mother was contacted by the VP of Whitley, and told her that my sister registered but didn't attend prom - as if she had a choice and that I contacted reporters. They (Mother + sister) were asked to go down to the school, but I told them not to until Friday since they are likely to not address the unethical behaviour of the teaching staff, but try to smoke their way out of trouble. Additionally, reporters contacted me through this thread, I haven't made the first step to approach media. 

**EDIT 4**: 11 Jan 2018 - My mother was contacted by the Principal of Whitley to inform her that the school will forgo the $60, but did not mention the $50 that was forcefully charged. Now I'm curious to find out what made them think packaging the interview course with the prom would be a great idea. Their true intention seems to be force participation for prom night, hence bundling the two separate events together. Will find out tomorrow.

**EDIT 5**: 12 Jan 2018 - Sister got her results and was very happy about it :D. [Here] (https://imgur.com/a/HU3ja) is what she told me the Principal addressed to the class, which reeked of bullshit, but I'm happy that she finished her secondary education. Forgive the typos.

DISINI is a curated festival consisting of a series of events, art exhibitions and public engagements. Spurred by its locale, DISINI borrows its name from the Malay adverb ‘di sini’, meaning ‘over here’. 

The Gillman area has been occupied in as far back as 1349 as noted by Wang Dayuan, a Chinese trader who penned personal encounters with communities living near Longyamen, between Sentosa island and Labrador Point. Today, this historical landscape includes iconic sites such as Haw Par Villa, Pasir Panjang Terminal, the shrine of Raden Mas Ayu, Bukit Chandu and Labrador Park. These landmarks sit within a 4-km radius surrounding Gillman Barracks and string the curatorial premise for DISINI. Catchwords such as ‘divinity’, ‘trade’, ‘war’, ‘myth’, ‘monument’, ‘sanctuary’, ‘flora’, ‘occupation’ and ‘hero’, present ideas that call out to be excavated and engaged. 

Through DISINI, the site presents possibilities for meaningful meetings and a juncture to consolidate the collective spirit.

~~[PG.Lost - Versus tour with In Each Hand A Cutlass](https://www.esplanade.com/events/2018/pglost) @ Annexe Studio at The Esplanade~~

~~5 January 2018 l Tickets from S$65~~

~~PG.Lost are an instrumental four-piece from Sweden. Their multifaceted approach to post-rock touches on the industrial, experimental and electronic, however they are far more than the sum of their parts. Their sound is throbbing with great melancholy, but there is also an element of dirty rock n' roll thrown in, and can careen from being crushingly heavy to delicately fragile. Their latest album Versus (2016) on Pelagic Records is their fourth full-length after Key (2012), In Never Out (2009), and It's Not Me, It's You! (2008). The band has toured extensively in Europe and China, and 2018 takes them to Southeast Asia for the first time.
It'll be a night that fans of instrumental post-rock will be sure to revel in and remember.~~

~~[Imagine Dragons Evolve World Tour](http://www.sportshub.com.sg/sportshubtix/Pages/Imagine-Dragons-2018.aspx) @ Singapore Indoor Stadium~~

~~7 January 2018 l Ticket prices starts from S$98~~


~~Since making their full-length debut with 2012’s multi-platinum Night Visions, Imagine Dragons have drawn worldwide adoration for their anthemic yet moody alt-rock. On their third album Evolve, the Grammy Award-winning band shift perspective and take on a brighter but more layered emotional outlook.~~

~~Throughout Evolve, Imagine Dragons find unlikely glory in intense self-reflection. On “Whatever It Takes,” the band turns self-doubt into a soaring, shimmering epic driven by heavy beats and Reynolds’s rapid-fire flow. Another moment of reckoning, “Thunder” brings waves of majestic harmonies and warped vocal effects to Reynolds’s recounting of his life’s journey so far.~~

~~Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them a grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope by hit making producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fan base with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.~~

~~Don’t miss indie folk luminaries Fleet Foxes as they bring their spellbinding blend of lush instrumentation and sweeping harmonies live in Singapore for the very first time at the Esplanade Theatre!~~

~~Formed in Seattle, Washington, Fleet Foxes is made up of Robin Pecknold, Skyler Skjelset, Casey Wescott, Christian Wargo and Morgan Henderson. In 2008, Fleet Foxes’ self-titled debut made a profound impact on the international musical landscape, earning them Uncut magazine’s first ever Music Award Prize and making numerous ‘Best Of’ lists, including Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of the 2000’s and Pitchfork’s 50 Best Albums of 2008. The follow-up album ‘Helplessness Blues’ (2011) was met with the same critical praise as its predecessor, debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and earning the band a GRAMMY nomination for Best Folk Album. This year, Fleet Foxes returned with their third studio album ‘Crack-Up’ to the delight of fans worldwide. In the words of Q magazine, “(Crack-Up is) a rich, ideas-driven record which pulls off a pretty unlikely feat: infusing Fleet Foxes’ music with the same sense of transcendence and beauty that they managed the first time, now delivered with an added sense of expansive musical ambition. Confirms that rarest of achievements: a group somehow hanging on to the essence of who they are, while pushing their art into thrillingly unforeseen places.”~~

Requesting help for university application,7,7m6i9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7m6i9u/requesting_help_for_university_application/,16,2017-12-26 23:32:50,"Hi all, just have some questions regarding university application for the next step in my life.

Currently I'm an NSF that's about to ORD in May 2018. I have a Diploma in Logistics and Operations management from Temasek Polytechnic. Unfortunately I didn't get a very good GPA for my final results (3.30) and from what I heard if you have below 3.5 you don't need to consider anything outside of a private uni?

I am hoping to get a degree that has more options for jobs in the future. In particular, I'm interested in going into the more psychological side of things rather than continuing to study business as after ~2 years into the course I discovered that the monotony of the business-related courses put me off quite a lot. Doing something repeatedly over the course of months without any opportunity to innovate nor explore feels quite mundane, in comparison to something which requires actual interaction with people that changes on a daily basis.

With that in mind, I'm currently doing some research into what kind of courses would be good for me, but the amount of information is quite overwhelming. I have heard about a degree in sociology which seems to be quite general?

Anyone have any suggestions or tips?

Of course the remaining option would be to just throw out my resume and find a HR related job, but I do feel like getting a job that would allow me to help society more would be better (like a counselor). And yes I'm quite aware the leap from business to psychology might be a tad too large, which is why I'm at a loss right now.

Edit: Should also add that my Chinese language is utter garbage (took CLB in O lvls, never touched anything Chinese related again after that), will that hinder me if I should attempt to further my studi",InanimateDream,better off without me

My journey from underachieving student to moderately competent adult,221,4g2ang,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4g2ang/my_journey_from_underachieving_student_to/,201,2016-04-23 21:43:23,"**Context:** An older friend told me that a parent wanted to talk to ‘learn about my educational journey’ and ‘understand better what I do now’.  

It occurred to me that that’s something that might be worth writing down for others as well. Here goes.

I was born in 1990.

**Books:**

I grew up reading a lot of books of all kinds. My mom would take me to the library every week or so. I would read books about dinosaurs, natural disasters, space, ancient Greeks and Romans and Egyptians and so on. My “I know it’s impossible” dream was to be an astronaut, I think, and I sort of assumed that I would be maybe a scientist of some kind, with the lab coat and cool tools solving puzzles. I loved puzzles. I had a book series called Charlie Brown’s ‘Cyclopedia that I would read over and over again, particularly the Space book. (I think that was Book 8.)

**Chores:**

I never had to do any. My parents were moderately well off and could afford a domestic helper. My parent’s logic was this: if I didn’t have to do any chores, I could spend more time studying. I think this was a well-intentioned bad idea. Kids should do chores and develop a sense of responsibility and ownership.

Video games:

My first introduction to video games I think was on the SEGA console. My brothers were playing racing games and fighting games. I played Street Fighter and a bunch of other games like that whenever I had the chance.

**Computers:**

At some point I fell in love with computers. I loved the Internet. Around this time I began to develop the vague idea of becoming a computer game developer or a web designer. I persuaded my parents to buy me books about HTML and Javascript. I learned a lot of HTML and a bit of CSS, but I never quite got through Javascript and C++ – it was too complicated for me at the time and I didn’t really see the point. I made some websites on free web hosting services, about my favorite games and jokes and so on.

**Primary School:**

I went to Opera Estate Primary School, which was where my older brother had gone to. I got into Digimon (but Pokemon not so much). I was into more computer games at this point– Red Alert, Metal Slug. I was still reading books. I would get very good results at school (high 90s, sometimes 100). I would read all of the textbooks entirely before school began, and everything was simple and familiar to me.

I think I was in P3 when I first learned from some classmates about pornography. It seemed really weird and I don’t know what I thought about it.

**GEP:**

In 1999 I took a test and did well enough on it to qualify for the Gifted Education Program. To me it didn’t really seem like a big deal, I did well on tests all the time and thought it was just normal for me. I think I assumed everyone else must’ve been the same as me, and if they weren’t doing well maybe they just didn’t feel like it…? I don’t know. Anyway, I think this was a big deal to my parents, particularly my dad, who was very proud and would tell anybody who’d listen about how smart his son was. (I don’t recommend doing this if you’re a parent.)

I enjoyed the GEP. I enjoyed how they challenged us and took us very seriously and treated us intellectually like adults. They’d also tell us things like “you’re the cream of the crop” and “you’re the future leaders of the country”, and it didn’t really occur to me to question that. I developed an unnatural, clueless, naive sort of  self-confidence or arrogance that would take me many years to unlearn. I don’t think I’ve completely unlearned it.

**Homework:**

I hated homework. I had never developed any sort of discipline or work ethic. I just wanted to play all the time and I didn’t understand why homework was necessary. It was just about decoding textbooks, which were very boring puzzles as far as I was concerned. In fact it wasn’t puzzling at all– it was just grunt work. I didn’t like it and I’d put it off. It was far more interesting to watch Anime on TV (which had interesting storylines and character development), or to play video games that rewarded you for completing challenges and so on.

I didn’t really have a clear mental model for what sort of career I wanted, or what sort of work or sacrifices I would have to do to get there. I was told that I was the creme de la creme, so surely I would figure it out along the way. I was going to do well whatever I did, so why bother? (Prophecies are bad.)

It’s interesting to look back at my report cards to learn more about what kind of person I was. I was typically attentive and engaged when the teacher was interesting, and I would be quick to participate, raise my hand, and so on. But I was also disruptive, I would crack a lot of jokes, talk to other people, read books under the table, etc.

I don’t think I was mean or nasty to anybody– I always felt really bad whenever I got anybody in trouble, or made a teacher frustrated or upset. I think many teachers have yelled at me over the years. Thinking about it brings back a familiar anxiety and discomfort in my stomach. I don’t blame those teachers for what they did, they were in a difficult place themselves and managing a classroom can’t be easy. But that’s how it is.

I kept spending as much time doing whatever I liked as I could. Sometimes I would get angry and upset with myself and stare at myself in the mirror, angry-crying, demanding that I start focusing on my schoolwork and pull my up grades and stop disappointing my parents and my family and the State (because GEP kids get more resources invested in them, I was brought to special meetings just to be told that) and Be A Good Kid. This would typically last a couple of days, maybe a week. But then it would be back to distractions, video games (my parents would try to keep them away from me but I would find workarounds. Sometimes I’d invent projects and other things and go to friends’ houses to play) and so on.

**Secondary School:**

It was sort of assumed that I’d end up in RI. I didn’t. I got 245 for my PSLE– which is criminally low for a GEP kid, you’re supposed to get 260+. My dad slapped me for it. I would go to Victoria School and I’d go there on probation– meaning if I didn’t do well enough at the end of the year, I’d be kicked out of the GEP. That was exactly what happened. For a brief moment I was given the impression that I would have to repeat Sec 1 in another school, but thankfully my Principal (Ang Pow Chew, good man) allowed me to go to Sec 2.

In VS I was in the IT Club but I didn’t really participate very much. I was excited for a while but eventually got bored and would avoid it. I began to develop an interest in Basketball, and I would research things like “how to get better at basketball”, dribbling techniques, drills, etc. Unfortunately VS didn’t have a basketball team (athletic resources were limited and funnelled into Soccer)  so I was mostly left playing at community centers and such after school. I would go to the gym from time to time but I didn’t know how to do the big things like squats and deadlifts, so I wasted my time doing bicep curls and tricep extensions. (Many years later I’d realize that squats and deadlifts are amazing and that I should’ve been doing them all along.)

I didn’t do great in Sec 2– I was probably in the middle third or maybe bottom half of the cohort. I attributed this to my disinterest in the way we were taught mathematics and science (chemistry and physics). It was just Not Interesting. I didn’t like memorizing things without understanding the rationale behind it. (Many years later I would find math and science utterly beautiful when learning about it from people who were passionate about it. Did you know that a parabola can always be described as an intersection between a plane and a cone? Why doesn’t anybody tell you this in school?)

I decided to pick 7 subjects instead of 8 in sec 3, thinking that I would use the extra time / free periods to do homework and study. Ha. Instead I would end up hanging out with most of the weaker students– smart guys (they did get into VS) but underachieving. We did have a bunch of fun. We’d skip school and go to LAN shops or play pool (I was terrible at pool, still am). On hindsight I think those were some of my favorite things about school, and honestly we could probably cut out a lot of the curriculum and people would still be fine. Just show them a bunch of really good videos by really passionate people in their fields and let them follow their curiosities. At least that’s what I would do for my younger self.

Anyway– I did do some studying in the final months towards my O’s. I got 14 points for my prelims, and assumed that that would mean I would get maybe 10 points for my O ‘s, which would get me into SAJC (which was where I wanted to go, because they had a cool uniform, a cool campus and a good basketball team). I got 14 points again and ended up going to TPJC.

**Music:**

My parents sent me to tuition for my O levels, but I ended up just making a bunch of friends there and didn’t study. Around that time I developed an interest in live music, and wanted to play in a band. I found a couple of bandmates and we started practicing, writing our own songs, doing gigs. I had a lot of fun promoting the band– coming up with the name, coming up with an image, talking to promoters, getting us to play gigs, corresponding with fans on MySpace and so on. It was way more fun and way more REAL than school. I started organizing my own gigs and we even made a bunch of cash from it– I think we made over $1,000 from our first gig, which was pretty good money for JC kid.

**Junior College:**

I found JC utterly stifling and fake, way worse than secondary school (I still miss and love VS). I picked up smoking. I would typically stay up late every night– I would blog, I think, and talk to friends outside of school– and go to school sleep-deprived like a zombie.

I had to repeat JC 1, which was a kick in the stomach from me. GEP student and now a repeat student. But I rationalized it away as “I didn’t do well because I didn’t study”. I tried to persuade my family that I would do better in Poly, but they would have none of it. So I just trudged along. 2007 was a really bad year for me. I liked some of my teachers, but JC in general felt like a farce and I wish I had never gone. My results weren’t good enough to get into any local Universities (NUS, SMU, NTU).

I used to skip school in my O level year and go to the Esplanade to study and get through overdue homework. I wouldn’t do nearly as much as I had planned to do. I would go to the Esplanade Library and pick out a bunch of Men’s magazines to read. I was particularly a fan of Esquire (and I particularly like Tom Chiarella, great writer). I began to develop the idea that I would work in the media industry some day. I might’ve written a blogpost about that somewhere– “I want to work in the media”.

I used to work at Shangri La Hotel when I was saving money to pay for my band’s CD, and I remember witnessing an media event thinking “I’d want to work in the media”. I’m kinda glad that didn’t play out, because I hear horror stories from friends in the media all the time these days. And at this point I have to say it’s utterly criminal how poorly we prepare kids to have the right sort of expectations about what a career is like, what working life is like.

**NS:**

Anyway. So I didn’t get into any of the universities, and it was time for NS. I was determined to make the most of my NS experience– I was hoping to chiong sua and become an officer. But I was given a temporary PES E status because they suspected I had Marfan’s Syndrome (for being very tall and skinny). So I couldn’t go to BMT straightaway– I became a storeman instead. I decided to use the free time to read and learn as much as I could, and threw myself into books about business and self-improvement and philosophy and everything else I was interested in. I built a community of friends (some from the music scene, some from friends-of-friends, Facebook was becoming a thing by now). I built a Facebook community. I started blogging regularly.

**Blogging:**

At some point I had written a blogpost about Singapore that got a bunch of comments, and that made me happy and excited (to get a bunch of comments) so I did more of that, and developed a bit of a reputation and a following. I decided that that was going to be my beachhead into my new life– that I was going to become some sort of blogger/writer type person. I figured that if I did it well enough for long enough, I’d get some interesting opportunities that I wouldn’t be able to imagine yet.

(I think some of this thinking might’ve been from some of the books I read, but I can’t quite pinpoint it to a single thing. The Internet always seemed like a magical land of opportunity to me, and I didn’t understand why other people didn’t see it that way.)

I decided that I was going to re-take my A’s as a private candidate, and document that process, and become a tutor for underachieving smart kids.

Eventually I actually got invited to the Istana to chat with the PM. The post I wrote about that got a lot of attention, and I got a bunch of invitations and job offers. This convinced me that I didn’t need to force myself to worry so much about the A’s– so I pretty much stopped studying and just kept blogging. (I did only slightly better than the previous time, I think, but with an entirely new subject and no teachers.)

**Job:**

I was planning to become an SIA flight steward, thinking I would make money and then blog in my downtime. But that didn’t work out. I went out for coffee with a couple of people who asked me, and one of them was the co-founder of a software company.  He asked me to manage their blog and social media efforts, which I agreed to mainly because I needed the money.

Turns out that I really loved the team and the working environment, and I’m still there 3-4 years later. I’ve developed my marketing and writing chops, and even manage other writers now. I’ve had several job offers since, but I’ve turned all of them down because I like where I am too much. (I wish I could clone myself. I suppose the next best thing I could do is train other people to do what I do– it’s really not that hard, it’s just applied common sense.)

So I’m in a pretty good place now, career-wise. I make a pretty decent amount of money, and I have the luxury of turning down job offers. My skillset is something that’s quite in demand, so I don’t really need to care about the economy or job prospects or whatever. There are several people who’d love to hire me tomorrow if I quit, which is something I honestly always believed would happen someday as long as I kept doing what I was doing. In the early days people would tell me that I was stupid, delusional, small-minded, didn’t understand how the world worked, idealistic, blah blah blah.

But at the end of the day it’s simple economics, isn’t it? If you can do something that people are willing to pay for, then you’re not going to go hungry. If you have design skills, writing skills, or best of all, if you can code, then you’re never going to go hungry. It might take a while to get good enough that people notice you and seek you out, but it works.

**“Advice”:**

Anyway so I’m guessing the reason my friend asked me about this is because a parent has a child who’s similar to me– really unhappy with school. What would I say to a person like that, or to their parents?

I guess the first thing I would say is– **if you’re not happy in school, you’re probably not going to be happy working in the sort of job that school prepares you for.** You’re not going to do well in the civil service, I think. So you shouldn’t try to force that, because then you’d probably be miserable and life is too short to be miserable at the thing you spend most of your time on.

Secondly– **I wish I had spent MORE time pursuing my random little interests, not less.** I wish I had also learned to code, and draw, and do design. Because those are very valuable skills in demand in the modern web age. Startups are a big thing now, and they’re not going to go away. People are constantly looking to build the next Facebook, and there’s a lot of money looking to invest in those things. What that means is that there are many young new companies willing to take risks on hungry young people who’re willing to learn.

That said, I did get lucky, the first person I seriously talked to turned out to be the real deal. There are a bunch of scammers and bullshitters who’ll try to get you to work for next to nothing. That’s why you should develop your bullshit detector as early as you can. You can increase your own luck by developing a body of work that you put in the public domain. The more work you do, and the more you put yourself out there, the more chances you

**Get disciplined.** The worst thing about my life then and now is that I never developed much discipline or work ethic. I don’t mean that in an exaggerated sense. I can foresee myself saying that on my deathbed, and that’s an outcome I’m desperately trying to avoid. It gets harder the longer you've gone without it. The challenge with smart, bullshit-sensitive kids is that they won’t develop discipline just because you tell them to. You have to pick something that THEY WANT TO DO, and then show them how discipline helps them achieve THAT. I think Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture covers all of this beautifully, so I’d refer you to that.

Just typing this post up real quick. I'm very lost as to what I should do in life.. I posted a year ago and my depression got the best of me. Things haven't been going very smooth lately and I find myself having no means of improving my life without educating myself first.

Like I said, I am a secondary school dropout. A quick tl;dr of my life would be that I grew up in a shit family, met the wrong people, got led on the wrong path. I've never done anything great for myself and have no friends. This is the one thing I want to do to set my life straight.

My current goals are to take all my exams with Pearson. Singapore universities, or polytechnics recognize the certs. They have the iGCSEs, which is the O-level equivalent and A levels. I plan to study most of my days off for the next 10 months in time for the exams in June 2017, enrolling in an online course which covers English, Bio, Chem, Science, Maths and History.. afterwhich I will spend 2 years studying for A-levels.

Is this plausible? Even so/If not, are there better alternativ",ineedhelpplease17,better off without me
"[Post-N Levels] PFP, DPP or Sec 5?",25,5jr0ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5jr0ja/postn_levels_pfp_dpp_or_sec_5/,21,2016-12-23 07:07:28,"Since 2012, the Polytechnic Foundation Program (PFP) and Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Program (DPP) [in the past only 'O' level students were offered this choice] were introduced as ""through-train"" programs for the Secondary 4 Normal Academic students. What I'm going say below are just some advices.

Every year people will get torn apart on which pathway to choose. Let's get one thing straight:
To me, **ANY** of this pathway is good. Yes, I mean it. Each of these pathways has its own set of pros and cons so you have to be really sure of what's going to happen next. 

---------------------------------------------------

**PFP** - To me, this will be the best choice if you want to eventually enroll in a polytechnic. This is because it's almost a **guarantee** you'll get to Year 1 (provided you don't slack off during Year 0, skip classes etc). However, the course that you choose/accept should be something you **WANT** to study (or that it'll benefit you in the future). I'm not sure if you're able to transfer after Year 0, but it is recommended that you stay in the course you're currently studying in but based on the website it is a case-to-case basis. The PFP sets aside a total of 1,200 places in all 5 local polytechnics. PFP's application period is usually after the release of the GCE 'O' Level Results. 

Do not feel *discouraged* that due to the lack of an 'O' Level certificate, you will not be able to enroll into a local university. That's not true.

**HOWEVER**, as you lack an 'O' Level certificate, you cannot fail in Polytechnic because you have nothing to fall back on and in Singapore, the 'N' Level certificate is *not recognized*. 

I've also been told that your performance in PFP will be the substitute for your 'O' level certificate. As much as the bare minimum is to just pass all the modules and progress to Year 1, it'll be really more advantageous if you put in effort and score as high as possible so if you're considering to enter a Local University, it may put you at a better spot.

Many has stated that the PFP gives a unique experience to PFP students as compared to those that only enroll after their 'O' Levels. It also gives you a much better foundation and you will probably be used to the Polytechnic curriculum by the end of Year 0. 

**CAUTION**: Please do NOT screw up your 5 choices (you're advised to choose wisely) OR accept a course that you don't even intend to study. You'll *regret really badly* afterwards and there are already many cases of that happening. 
You can choose to **appeal** to up to a maximum of 3 choices if you don't get the course that you wanted.

If your points are very high, it's recommended that you choose courses of your interest and that you have a good chance of getting in. (Unless you're willing to take the risk).

Should you get a course that is not what you desire, I would suggest that you choose other pathways (DPP or Sec 5) unless you're sure you may perhaps get interested after trying out the course. *OR* you could try to change your course by approaching your Polytechnic (however, you have to take note that you **need** to be the Top few to be able to change. It's kind of a risk in my opinion). 

**NOTE:** Different Polytechnics offer *different* courses. Go to the specific polytechnic's website and browse through on what they offer under PFP. 
To be eligible for PFP, you must get a **raw** score of 11 points and/or below. With *at least* a **B3 in English** for courses under Group 1 (usually Science/Technology related) or an **A2** for courses under Group 2 (Business/Humanities/Media related). You're only able to deduct bonus CCA points during the posting of courses (which that will be your net score). 

Raw score = Score for N levels without having to minus bonus CCA points 

PFP website: https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/pfp_introduction.html

^ What you need to know is mostly there, or else consult a teacher/counselor or the various polytechnics to clear your doubts. Do remember to go for the Open House as well. 

---------------------------------------------------

**DPP** - Choose this pathway if you neither want to continue with Sec 5 as you're afraid you may not do as well for 'O' Levels or if you're not given a course that you want for PFP. This will enroll you into a Higher Nitec course in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). You will have to first attend a 10 week preparatory course (or roughly about 3 months) before starting on your Higher Nitec course in April. 

**Application Phase:**
You can start to apply for DPP immediately after the release of the GCE 'N' Level Results in December or after the release of the GCE 'O' Level Results in January. Should you not get the course you want in December, you can choose to apply again in January. 

Upon completing the program and achieving the minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) required, you'll enroll into a local Polytechnic either in Year 1 or Year 2. Please note that **NOT** all courses allow you to enter straight into Year 2. Refer to the booklet that you've been given for more information. As much as they say that a minimum GPA of 2.5/3.0 is required, having at least a GPA of 3.5 should guarantee you the course that you want especially if you're applying for courses that are more popular. DPP sets aside about a total of 1,000 places every year and it's offered in all 3 ITEs.

Please do not *feel discouraged* that ITE is a bad place, or all those that goes to ITE do not study. That's absolutely **NOT** true. Search up on Google, there are many success stories and each year ITE is becoming better and better. **Just because you took a longer route, does not mean you're a failure.** Sometimes we may need more time, but it does not matter as long as we achieve what we want to achieve at the end. 

**NOTE:** To be eligible for DPP, you have to get 19 points and/or below. For Applied Sciences, Engineering or Info-Communication Technology courses, your English has to be *at least* a B4. For Business & Services related courses, your English has to be at least a B3. Different ITEs offer different courses under the DPP. You are to submit up to a total of *12* choices of the different courses/ITE you wish to enter.

---------------------------------------------------

**Sec 5** - Choose this pathway if you want to go to a Junior College (JC) **OR** you're sure that you can do well enough for 'O' Levels **OR** the course that you want is not offered under PFP/You didn't get the course you desire. When you go to Sec 5, it is true that you'll definitely drop a few grades in some subjects (but it is not true that it'll definitely happen to ALL your subjects) and you *MUST* have the **determination, motivation and discipline** to do well. You have to know that you're now competing with even more people - even those from top schools. The bellcurve may not always be in your favour and you're now graded on the same bellcurve as the 4Es (unless there's a difference in syllabus). There's roughly more than 30,000 students per year taking 'O' Levels but for 'N' Levels it's roughly 11,500 and/or above.

You must not slack off at any point, but of course you should give yourself a break if you need it so that you don't burn out and completely give up halfway. You must **NOT** have the mindset that you can study a few weeks before or do last minute preparations for 'O' Levels because do remember, this is not 'N' Levels. Comparing both of these examinations, *'N' Level is considered a breeze.* Not only that, the markers are definitely more stringent when it comes to marking your 'O' Level scripts. There is definitely a significant gap between these 2 examinations so you have to catch up on more contents in less than a year. 

To choose this pathway, you have to be *absolutely sure* you'll do well because if your points are very high, you'll be less likely to be able to apply/enter a course that you want (even more so if it's a popular course). You have to make sure that you'll do well in English and Maths because both of these subjects has caused many students to not be able to enter Polytechnic because they got more than a D7 (getting a D7 would have already limited the number of courses you can choose). 

**NOTE:** To be eligible for Sec 5, you have to get at least 19 and/or below, with at least a C5 in both English and Mathematics. 

Sec 5 FAQ: Consult your teachers or counsellors.

---------------------------------------------------

P.S. All these are just my *2 cents worth* so you have the right to agree or disagree with what I've said above. If you have even more advices or questions (you can choose to PM me too), do comment below. Go for whichever pathway you want, just be sure that you're being realistic (unless you're willing to take risks) and I hope you get to where you want to be!

If you're wondering why I've only highlighted on English for most of the eligibility criteria, it's because it's the subject where many people couldn't meet the requirement.

"Its not about you, its about them (or, how I learnt to hate the Singapore taxi system)",98,2lbyrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2lbyrx/its_not_about_you_its_about_them_or_how_i_learnt/,112,2014-11-05 19:29:40,"In Melbourne, where I am from, it is an offence for a taxi driver to cherry-pick fares. Here in Singapore, it seems an acceptable practice.

Lines and lines of taxi drivers last Friday night kept passing. Forty five minutes, and I counted (guestimated) 55 cabs that slowed down, asked where we were going, and then sped off. Finally, we had to resort to bribery ""we will give you extra money if you take us, please, no one is stopping"",a nd only then did he do it grudlgingly, and he was apparently going the same way as us as wel!! (He was going to Pasir Ris, we were going to Geylang - its on the fxn way, in the same direction, dude!)

Begging the whole ""Change of shift, must get home to family""  - and ""not going that way"" or just simply speeding away when the fare isnt to their liking is bullshit - oh sorry, not going *your* way? huh? Im not a freakin hitchhiker trying to bum a lift, Im going to pay you for your damn service. 

Nowhere in Singapore is far away. Nowhere is more than an hours drive (and thats going one end to the other!). There is abslutely fkn nowhere that is ""inconvenient"" for the driver to take a passenger.

Nowhere else in the world have I seen this, and damn, I have traveled. As i mentioned, its even actually against the law for taxis to do this in Australia. Ive had better taxi service in run down twenty year old cars in Guatemala than I have had here.

In Singapore, its just not about where you want to go - its about where they want to go, and thats plain bullshit -allowing drivers to do this without repercussion is the mark of a broken system, whereby the public that they are supposed to be servicing is put second to the driver and his convenience and needs.

How often does this happen to you? How do you feel about it? would it be better if laws were put in place to stop taxi drivers doing this? Would it ever happen (doubtful in Sg, in my mind)?

The SG taxi system is utterly broken - discuss.

/endrant

**tl;dr - Singapore taxis fkn suck and they shouldnt be allowed to cherry-pick rides and refuse customers if they arent ""going their way""**

edit: yes, this is very rant-y - apologies, it just really, really annoys me and its something I really think needs to be fixed :D

edit2: Thanks all for sharing this link as well to the regulations, I do see its not a matter of the regualtions not being there, its a matter of enforcement and unscrupulous drivers taking advantage of certain situations.

First off, not sure if this is the ""right"" place to ask - I am aware that there is /r/cameras, but the availability of cameras around the world may be different. Also, I did a search prior to the creation of this post and there seem to be quite a bit of people with expertise, so am seeking your kind help! 

After browsing ClubSnap and other camera review sites, I'm rather spoiled for choice. Or rather, I don't know where to begin. Am aware that camera choice is up to each individual's preference/use, but I am wondering if anyone has suggestions for the below:

* Looking for something ""better"" and more ""sophisticated"" than the usual point-and-shoot. For my father, predominantly. So hopefully, it is dummy-proof and as ""easy"" to use as possible. Also, ideally with an in-built anti-shake feature. 

* Mostly for taking scenery photos, occasional jump shots for family fun (the point-and-shoot fails us here, haha), food - nothing too fancy, really. We can do without the video feature. 

* Budget: Below $800 preferably. Looking to purchase this as a gift for my dad. 

If anyone has any suggestions on camera shops, that will be greatly appreciated. I saw suggestions for John 3:16, but a quick Google search showed that the shop is now closed (?). 

Lastly, I am not sure whether ""entry-level"" is the right term, but please point me in the correct direction. All advice appreciated.

Tips for 'O' Levels?,19,2if456,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2if456/tips_for_o_levels/,51,2014-10-06 20:23:48,"Hello!

I'm taking my 'O's in 10 days, and I'm a little anxious as to whether I'm using studying in the most efficient way or not.

My pre-lim results weren't too shabby (3 distinctions), with only my English holding me back. (C5,59%) My main areas of concern are:


* At this juncture in time, is it more advisable to do past year papers from other schools or focus solely doing on my TYS'?(already completed everything once, feel the need to do it a few more times)
* As for my English, with the new syllabus, I'm finding it rather difficult to cope with Paper 2, which is more literary in nature. Do I just read more widely or do I start practicing past year papers as well? (though I don't think English works this way). For Paper 1, I find it hard to write under the advised word limit, therefore there are more mistakes, so is it better to write in long, cohesive sentences or short abrupt sentences?

I know that at this point I shouldn't be on reddit but I'm spending whatever free time I have outside of studying to know how to study more efficiently. I'm currently doing practice papers from other schools for maths and science and in the middle of nowhere for my english(just trying to read widely). Content wise, I can more or less do the practice papers without referring to my notes, but I can still refine my knowledge further.
Humanities is the least of my worries as I've been consistently doing well in it for the past year, just need to memorise my content, which I'm working towards.

Which maid to choose? by Ming Lee Lim ,17,gxmas,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gxmas/which_maid_to_choose_by_ming_lee_lim/,3,2011-04-26 23:36:10,"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home.
 
My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes.
 
For example:

1)     She flooded my kitchen –  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn’t). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won’t happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!

2)     She didn’t close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn’t apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying “What to do, it has happened.” Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 

3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don’t always want to come back at the end of the day.

4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms). 
 
Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are “Commited to Serve” – but I think it is just rhetoric and I don’t see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn’t big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors.
 
I have to decide whether to renew my maid’s 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary.
 
Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance.
 
People say that the devil you know is better than one you don’t. But I feel that I can’t tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one? Appreciate your advice.

Need Life Advice - True Blue Singaporean Who's Now Black and Blue and Getting the Blues,12,9sla7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9sla7i/need_life_advice_true_blue_singaporean_whos_now/,107,2018-10-30 22:08:05,"Hi guys, I've been stalking this reddit for months now, and owing to how my life is going, I thought I should seek advice from my fellow Singaporeans here. I'm not sure how to phrase it all, but I'm going to try. (WARNING: GIANT WALL OF TEXT AHEAD)

Basically, I'm having a very serious crisis of sorts that I can't even classify with any confidence. I can't call it a mid-life crisis because I'm pretty happy with my job. Is it a personal financial crisis? Maybe, but I know for sure that I'm not starving when it comes to food or even savings and insurance - though I still have problems in this arena, they're not life threatening. Is it an identity crisis? No, because I know who and what I am.

I guess I'm just afraid for the future, of where I'm going with my current course and outlook in life, and I'm not sure if I'm making the right moves. I'm also afraid for the country's future, which is, of course, very much related to me since I'm a citizen of Singapore. Bringing it all together - basically, my worst fear is that Singapore becomes a dystopian nightmare and I'm going to suffer for it, since I'm a freelancing tutor.

I guess I'll break up my question into huge chunks. Let's start with money and work. Basically:

(EDIT: I've decided to leave out everything else not under work and money to a later date)

\- I earn under S$1,000 during off-peak months (usually November and December, under S$2,000 during the holidays (CNY, mid-term holidays, eg) but at my peak, my income balloons to up to S$3,700. This year is the first year I've worked as a Full-time tutor for an entire year (I started out last year, June, and was still building my business). My entire year's income is about S$25,000.

\- Benefits? People say that as a freelance tutor, I have no benefits. But part of the reason why I became a full-time tutor is because I disagree. My working hours are incredibly short. Even during peak periods, the longest I've worked is 5.5 - 6.5 hours a day, not counting travel time, because at least I get to relax and read books/play games/listen to music on the way. Usually, I work 3-4 hours a day. My working environment is rarely oppressive - I've only encountered one or two parents/guardians who are really a problem (one of them frequently delays payment while the other is a grandma with unrealistic expectations for her grandson despite being uneducated and knowing nothing about the ways of educating a child AND making sure he comes out alright and mentally balanced.)

\- The downside is that I'll still have to work if I'm sick. But I'm a strong man. I'm rarely sick - maybe once a year, and I'm a tough guy. I once taught tuition for an entire day despite having a crushing headache, a debilitating fever, flu, cough, runny nose, all the bad stuff. Ain't shit to me. It was unpleasant but I got through it, and I recovered very quickly from such illnesses. I was mostly fine the next day.

\- Basically, my goal is to maintain a very good work-life balance such that my physical and mental health remains optimal, and I don't have to lose all my hair over work. At the same time, I want to earn a sustainable income. I want my work arrangements to be flexible.

\- I won't ever become crazy rich, but I don't aim to be. Highest I'm aiming for is high-middle class. This way, to paraphrase Daniel Defoe, I won't have to want for anything, and at the same time, I won't gain the shameful excesses and debauchery of the rich, losing my moral fiber, character and discipline. What I won't ever have in terms of funds, I make up for with having precious personal time and emotional/mental well-being.

\- I don't plan to ever retire, but scale my working hours according to my abilities. The way I see it, I'm, in a way, already living a life that makes retirement meaningless, seeing that I have gained an incredible reservoir of personal time thanks to my lifestyle.

\- However, I plan to slog it out when I'm young (though this loses some meaning when I'm working a maximum of 30 hours a week where 'slogging it out' meant working double that to an office worker), in order to repay the remainder of my university debt (which is laughably easy to repay now that there's no interest as my father owns it, having paid for it in my stead after I graduated, and I've already paid slightly over half of it, 2018 being a good year), to build my savings in order to finance my savings plans, capital for investments as well as some basic insurance that will ensure that I don't end up in the streets if I happen to get lung cancer or something.

\- I'm proudly anti-CPF. As such, I'll avoid contributing to CPF unless absolutely necessary. This means higher disposable income, and savings. I'll instead shift my savings plan from public to private sources, as written above. Only trigger I can think of that'll force me to put money in CPF is if I need to get a house - I know that there are some benefits associated with paying for your house using CPF money. For one thing, I already have $6000 to $10,000 tucked in there that I will never, ever be able to touch. I can rescue that sum by using ALL my CPF money to get a house. Furthermore, there are government benefits if I pay with CPF money, as far as I know.

\- My current plan to maximize income (if I want to) is to put myself in tuition centres and schools hiring allied tutors, working longer hours and teaching more students to earn more at the high tuition rate that I'm earning. This might increase my monthly income at the cost of some of my work-life balance.

\- EDIT: Also, I have plans to diversify within my industry. A friend has contracted me to write for assessment books and papers.

\- For now, my SOP for the future is that I'll keep myself as healthy as possible such that I can work this job all the way until I'm freaking 70 or something. With this kind of lifestyle, exercise and healthy food is easy to get, so I find that this is not a problem. If worse comes to worse, if I ever become... less productive from a bum leg or broken kidney or something, I'll just scale down my working hours accordingly. By that age, all my savings plans and investments would have matured several times over, so there's that.

\- However, I'm getting the blues over this because of the inherent risk in being a freelancer - it means unstable pay (in comparison to a regular job), less protection (as evidence by that parent who keeps delaying payment. I have to hope Singapore doesn't suddenly get an epidemic of less-than-moral parents in the future). Although I'm confident of my abilities and my plans... I just can't shake off that sense of unease that came with the freedom I have. Some of my friends say that it's because of my upbringing - traditional parents with traditional Asian values = regular job, regular pay, regular benefits, conventional thinking.

**So... Here's the Question: Do you guys think that my alternative answer to the standard 8-6 office work life is sustainable and viable? Any suggestions to make it better? Any warnings to give me?**

(EDIT: I'm cutting it short here. I guess I'll ask the other questions next time)

EDIT: Well, I guess I'm done here. I appreciate some of the advice some of you gave, but the judgemental psychopaths of reddit had ruined an otherwise good experience. It's really sad because I've been to other reddit pages and the people there are nicer. It's like there's 10 times more salty shit-posters here for some reas",xbriannova,life is meaningless

I came across a few comments wondering on the meaning or purpose behind a posthumous promotion/award and it kind of peaked my interest, so I went to do some research :-)

Yes, no promotion or even monetary amount can ever fully compensate families on the loss of a loved one in service. After all, how can you possibly put a price on a loved one’s life? :-( Be that as it may, there are a few ‘benefits’ (for lack of a better word) in a posthumous promotion/award, from what I can find online. Not all are applicable to Singapore, but an interesting read nonetheless:

1. Given that rank and decorations are a big deal in the military, a promotion to the highest rank possible signifies a recognition of the persons service in the uniform. To some, rank may be meaningless, but think of it as a letter of appreciation or a plaque - it is a form of recognition by the organisation to officially acknowledge his service and sacrifices to the service. 

One interesting example of this was when US Delta Force snipers Shugart and Gordon were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honour for their sacrifices in Somalia (go watch Black Hawk Down - Jaime Lannister is one of the snipers hahaha). While it technically serves no purpose to them since they are  dead, it was a gesture by the US Army to recognise their sacrifices in service, and how their contributions led to the betterment of the organisation.

2. Not sure if this applies to the SAF, but I read that rank in some branches of the US military recognise rank as a benchmark for the amount of military compensation for the family. Thus, promotion to the highest rank possible accords the family with the highest financial compensation possible. 

If you know any other possible reasons, feel free to add them below! I’m not sure when it became the SAF’s policy to posthumously promote servicemen who tragically die during service, but I feel it’s a good policy to have. In any tragedy, some form of comfort and appreciation is better than none at all.

Before I entered the army, I was a relatively happy and cheerful guy with no problems whatsoever. Took things as it came and go, didn't really feel stressed, depressed, or burdened by any problems that I encounter in my life.

Fast forward to where I am now, I enlisted in the army, and now I'm a totally different person. I'm a miserable wreck, easily stressed and moody about any issue that I face in my daily life. The former me is long gone, it's as if I have totally changed to a different person. I've become an extremely pessimistic guy who cannot think of anything in a positive light.

When asking for help regarding my situation around my friends previously, all I got were the typical ""lan lan suck thumb"" responses, with some even saying that it's just an easy way of ""chao keng"", and accusing me of doing so. I know that's the standard Singaporean mentality and way of handling it, and maybe it works for everyone else, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Due to my terrible issues, I probably have pushed away most of the friends that I have had, with only some remaining, and I do not know when they might give up hope on me. I've also talked to my parents about it, with my father just thinking that I'm weak, before going on to talk about how ""back in my day, I had to do xxxx while you just do yyy"". My mother has helped me somewhat, but I still feel extremely bad everyday.

Pretty much everyone tells me that these 2 years will pass by faster than you think, but when everyday passes by at a snail's pace, that doesn't seem to work. Everyday I am just stuck here doing meaningless tasks which I do not see the point in. I do not have any goals, any aims, any motivations in my life. I do not have any sort of drive whatsoever to keep me going. The urge to just take the easy way out has been creeping on me steadily. Although I probably do not have the guts to do it, I fear that one day my brain might not think rationally anymore and I might just give in.

I fear the few hours before nightfall - the fact that I have to sleep on my bed eventually haunts me. I fear the time when I eventually have to get on my bed to sleep - the fact that I will eventually wake up to the ringing of my alarm clock eats at me. I fear the morning - it's the start of another day in this system, and I'm not getting out anytime soon. It has gotten to the point where sometimes out of nowhere in the mornings and nights, I just break down mentally and tears start to fall, and I just feel terrible. 

The family and few friends that I have now have advised me to either go see a psychiatrist, talk to my superiors about this issue, or talk to a SAF counsellor. I am at an utter loss of what to do right now - I know that there is the stigma of people reporting about depression in the army being labelled as just ""chao keng"" and that they won't treat you seriously. With people also telling me I am at a risk of being charged for malingering for reporting such issues to my superiors, I doubt whether or not I can trust my superiors when I tell them about this issue. I also am worried about what will happen to my future - if I seriously am diagnosed with a problem and have to go to IMH to get a record, my future job prospects will be ruined, and obviously getting a record isn't good at all.

Please, advise this kid who's just stuck in a system where he doesn't feel good in, on what steps he should take, and how I can get ",aimlessnsf,life is meaningless

From GLBT Voices Singapore,0,79803n,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/79803n/from_glbt_voices_singapore/,7,2017-10-28 19:29:09,"The first time after we had done it, I remember K cupping my face and looking into my eyes. He told me seriously that he would like to see more of me, but we could never have a long term relationship. Just like that. No fuss, no qualms. I kissed him back and told him he was being silly, like I was going to fall for him.

He was studying to be a doctor at that time while I was just finishing my NS. Physically he was everything a gay guy could want but he always walled himself up emotionally. Taking him at this word, I continued to have my own discreet affairs. We weren’t dating right? But we did all the things a couple could in Singapore – dinner, movies, night cycling through East Coast Park and lying on the beach as we talked and laughed while looking up at the night sky. The couple of times we went to the clubs, I thought I’d be the jealous one but instead he got uncomfortable when guys came to talk to me and that was the end of me going clubbing, as far as he was concerned. He still refused any forms of endearment that might mean we were seeing each other or ‘dating’. Once I texted him ‘I miss you’ and his reply was ‘I’m not into that’.

Still, we became so comfortable with each other that my parents got used to having him around. I wasn’t out to them but maybe they suspected. We hung out with a small circle of friends and everyone just referred to us as a couple, even though he never acknowledged it. He became a part of my life without my notice and I began to fall for him.

We started taking short trips together over the weekends. When we were in Bali, I met a hot American Chinese and was chatting him up when K stormed up and pulled me away. I was irritated and told him off, reminding him cruelly that he didn’t want a relationship and I could damn well talk to any guy I wanted, right? He didn’t reply me, just gave me this look of silent hurt and went back to our room.

Angry at him for not telling me why he wouldn’t admit he loved me, I went off with the ABC and spent the night with him. I returned in the morning feeling stupid and extremely guilty but he didn’t say a word of reproach, which made me feel worse. I finally couldn’t take it and just told him, if he couldn’t pick up the guts to admit he loved me and be with me, then we should stop seeing each other. He sat wordlessly on the bed and just nodded.

When we got back to Singapore, I packed the clothes he left at my place and threw it out of the door. I was so mad and hurt that he wouldn’t find me good enough to be his boyfriend, yet want me to stay exclusively with him only. I started sleeping around with guys I meet everywhere – the gym, the SAFRA pool, clubs, online. But no matter how often the random sex, I just couldn’t get him out of my head.

Then 3 years later, he turned up at my door. I was rushing an assignment for school and was about to leave when he knocked. I was hesitant about talking to him or even inviting him in but he said he would just tell me what he had to say and leave. No one was at home so I gave him a drink and told him to wait in the living room while I ran to my bedroom and texted my friend ‘omg what do I do HE is here!’. My friend’s reply was of no help, ‘Fuck him and make sure u use protection.’ Gee thanks.

So I sat down with him and asked him what’s happening. I was expecting all sorts of bullshit but I was not prepared for what he was about to tell me. He was getting married, to a girl he had met when he went scuba diving in Hin Daeng, the place he had promised to bring me once I was certified. It was a promise he made to his parents and as an only child, he was going to keep it. He handed me a card that he was holding, turned out to be the wedding invitation and he asked me if I could be there.

He said that this was a duty he had to do, but wanted me to know that the time we had spent together was the happiest he ever had. He was saying all those things about how I had made him feel but never told me till now, when it was too late. I sat there numbly not knowing what to think. I was losing the guy I love to… a girl he was marrying??

I lost it. I started by telling him that he was nuts, crazy for thinking he could keep up a sham marriage. I told him that he was a selfish bastard, for making me fall in love with him and not telling me once, just once he felt the same way for me until that day, the day he told me he was getting married?! I told him he was a fool for lying to his parents, I called him all sorts of names and I finally broke down and cried, not understanding why I couldn’t be good enough for him, or even just be a girl. I raged at him while my heart was breaking, splintering, shattering.

He spent the night with me. We made love with an intensity spurred by the knowledge that it would be our last night. In between, I laid curled up crying next to him while he held me like he never had. So many instances when I would pull back from kissing him, looking at him deep into his eyes, begging him silently to change his mind, that what we had at that moment meant more than anything to him. He never did.

In the morning, I couldn't bear to watch him leave. I told him to go and not to call me. I stayed huddled in the bed, the sheets smelling of what we did during the night and refused to see him out. When I heard the door shut, I knew I should just run after him, grab his hand and… and what? What could I do at that point that hadn’t been done already to tell him how much I love him?

I finally came out of the room when my mother came home that evening and called my name. She was holding onto an unmarked letter and inside was a card from him. It only had one line and it said, “Dear B, I love you. It will always be you.” I looked up at my mum and asked how she had gotten it, she said that K was waiting downstairs when she and my dad had gotten home and told her to pass it to me. I was dumbfounded, he was downstairs the entire day?!

She also said that he confessed to loving me and that he was gay, but he couldn’t be with me and apologized for breaking my heart. She asked me if this was true, that I was gay and I broke down and cried. She then hugged me and said it was okay, she was sorry I couldn’t work things out with the guy I love but she hoped I would find another guy who was just as sweet, maybe not so handsome because it made my sister jealous.

After that day, I tried hard to forget him. It was easy at first because I had to come out to my family proper and my sister was pissed that I didn’t tell her first. I didn’t know why I took so long to do it because they were okay with it. I asked my parents one day over lunch why weren’t they upset, I mean some of my friends were almost disowned the day they came out. My father looked at me and said why would he be upset that his son has the courage to face the difficulties that came with being gay, while my mum said jokingly that she was just pleased that she wasn’t getting a daughter-in-law to fight with over her son.

On the day of his wedding, I turned off my phone and spent the day with my friends, who tried their best to cheer me up. But throughout the day, I couldn’t stop thinking about how on the other side of the island he was promising to love and cherish another person and it hurt so so bad.

Life had to go on and it did for 7 years until she turned up. Last year, I had gotten a text asking if we could meet with no explanation whatsoever. We met up at a quiet bar after work and she introduced herself as C, K’s wife. I was surprised and slightly alarmed. I told her I hadn’t heard from K in years and we had nothing going on. She said it wasn’t about that and handed me a brown envelope.

Inside was an old army tee shirt of mine, one that had my unit’s insignia. There was also a picture we had taken on one of our many short trips and many movie ticket stubs, all the ink totally faded. I asked her why she was giving me these and she said that she was sorry, but K had passed away. He woke up in the middle of the night complaining of chest pains and by the time the ambulance had arrived, he had fainted. The paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he never came around. All this took place 2 months ago.

She was clearing his things when she discovered the envelope in his desk drawer, along with an old handphone she passed to me. Inside the phone was every text message I had sent him and she knew that I meant something to him. She asked if we were lovers and I didn’t know what to say. She told me that she wasn’t angry, that she always knew that her husband kept a part of him from her but he was loyal and provided for her. They had no kids though. She wanted me to have the things he had kept and said that we both obviously loved him a lot and she was glad that someone else loved him as much as she did.

We still keep in touch, as a strange sort of friendship developed between us. She never had a gay friend before and with her, I slowly learnt of his life after we had said goodbye. She recently started seeing a nice guy and I assured her he couldn’t possibly be gay, his taste in clothes was just too atrocious. She has always told me to find a nice boyfriend myself and I need to let go of the things I wanted to but didn’t say to him.

So if K was here, I would say to him, I love you. I never stopped loving you and I never will. You made me happy more than you ever knew, even when I didn’t understand why you couldn’t love me back. You gave me peace whenever you were around and thanks to you, the first time my parents knew I was gay was when a guy told them how much he loved me. Thank you for doing that.

I am a Singaporean.

I want to say, many Singaporean advocate ~~slavery.~~ (hyperbole)

Whether knowingly or unknowingly, the working conditions for foreign workers here in Singapore is atrocious. I was born in Singapore, lived here all my life, and I find that I am very blessed to live here. I have heard stories of people coming to Singapore to work, away from their families, children and/or wife. I always symphatise with them and their situation. I have some disturbing things I would like to share.

I am always on different location due to my work, and I have noticed a few things in particular. 

The maids of many families never get off days. Even if they get off, they have to get back by evening to prepare dinner for the family. They get about $500-$700 a month. Yet, many people say it's okay to have no or half-off days per month with that kind of money? They would argue ""Hey! we paid for their accomodation and food!"" Well, you paid for a small space for the maid to sleep. Not a room. Even if it was a room, she would most likely be sleeping on the ground with the grandparents and kids. I seen it with my own eyes. It's ridiculous. Recently there was an article about maids should have a full 24 hour day off. Not a half day off. C'mon they have been working nonstop for almost a year before they fly off to see their family. Is asking for 24 hours off day too much? I appalled to see some of the comments when I saw the facebook article. 

Foreign workers in dormitory have always been kept in a very bad conditions. Many workers are packed into one big room. There has also been a lot of accidental death in construction industry that we all do not hear about and never reported. I do not understand why many people continue to be racist towards them, and always shun them away like plague. Do they not know the building we lived in were constructed by them? I know they are not all saint. Bringing in many lowly educated foreigners may pose some social problems but we should at least show them the same respect we would give to another human being. 

~~I find that we are no different from Qatar when it comes to the treatment of foreign workers in Singapore. Maybe only slightly better than them, though I have never been to Qatar to see it firsthand.~~ Over-exaggeration.

What do you guys think? Am I wrong to say that many Singaporeans ~~advocate slavery?~~ (Hyperbole) Authorities could have done more to improve working conditions for migrant workers.

A little spooky story to help you sleep. Or not.,4,40mhyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/40mhyk/a_little_spooky_story_to_help_you_sleep_or_not/,43,2016-01-13 05:50:53,"Last night I was staying up late (till about 1:30AM) trying to root my sister's maid's phone because according to my sister the maid had some nasty pics in them and when my sister brought her to the agency, the maid deleted all the images. So I was attempting to recover them back. On top of those pics, the maid was doing some black magic related shit and was creeping everyone out. After all that, I found out she had been researching about succubus and load of weird shit so I was pretty disturbed for the night already.  

Anyways, back to the actual thing I wanted to share with you guys. After many failed attempts at rooting the phone and having enough of creepy findings, I finally gave up and decided to head to bed as I also had to go to work in the morning. I tried to fall asleep but many things were happening, one of it was this framed picture of a young boy I have hung on the side of my bed (it used to be on the wall but since shifting everything in my room, the frame is now hung on the end of my bed frame (it's a double decker bed so you can tie things to the upper deck's frame and hang them) and if it's windy or smt the frame will hit against the wall and make noise) that my sister got as a souvenir when she went overseas. As I was about to sleep, like as if some strong wind was blowing (my room is really stuffy and seldom has strong wind) the frame kept hitting against the wall really vigorously. For some reason I felt really scared after that. I tried to ignore it all and tried to sleep with my lights on but only managed to sleep for like half an hour. 

So like the baby I am, I took my pillow, blanket and bolster and went to sleep in my parents room. I have always been sleeping in my parents room recently, especially since I sleep alone now (used to share with my sisters) and frequently have this very uneasy feeling whenever I'm sleeping in my room unless I'm too tired to care or when my grandma sleeps with me when she comes over. So I made some space on the floor in my parents room and went to sleep. I couldn't sleep very well as my kidney area was hurting (probably dehydration) but I did not want to get out of the room to go and get water and I eventually fell asleep. 

So at around 6AM or so the adzan (the Muslim prayer call) will play as my parents are pretty religious and would wake up at that time to pray. At this time, I woke up as I'm a pretty light sleeper and saw my mom get up so I was like ""mom"" but she didn't look at me, she just stared straight ahead like as if something was infront of her and then she went back to sleep. I thought she did not hear me and tried to go back to sleep as well as I still had a lot of time before getting ready for work. After a few minutes, my mom got up and went to the bathroom and I decided that it was time for me to go back and sleep in my room as my parents will be walking around with the lights on and I won't be able to sleep. 

After that, I got up as normal and went for work as normal and then when I got home just now, my mom asked me to come over to her as she had something to say. Then she told me that in the morning when she woke up to the prayer call, she saw a really tall white figure infront of her with it's arm stretched out like Jesus (for the lack of better reference coming to my mind now lmao. No offence intended) in between me and my mom. My mom kept staring at me after that to see if I noticed it or anything but I noticed nothing.  

Now I'm really spooked out and don't wish to sleep in my room ;.; 

TLDR : Was feeling creeped out after finding out some stuff and got more creeped out so I eventually went to my parents room and slept there and my mom ended up being creeped out the next day and now I'm creeped out too.

It is a lovely city/state that filled with tons of interesting places to visit, food to eat, and sights to see. I would Highly recommend visiting if you ever get the chance too. Here are some tips I think would help you survive/be prepared for a trip to Singapore.

1. Bring two sticks of deodorant. (It's HOT! you'll shower like 500 times a day and you'll use a lot and sweat through. It's also hard to find trust me (after 5 stores) I Know. 

2. Bring sleeping pills. (Jet lag is a bitch... Unless you like sleeping only 2 hours and waking up at 2am every night.)

3. Bring extra boxers and socks. (refer to #1. You sweat and shower so much that you'll need the extras.... and then some.)

4. Have to camera batteries. (nothing is worse then being out and your camera dies.)

5. also a large memory card or multiple ones. ( same thing, you are out and capturing some awesome stuff, you dont wanna run out of room.)

6. Bring a back pack. (A purse is fine and all ladies but nothing beats the carrying space of a good old fashion backpack). 

7. Sunblock or pre-tan. (I myself hate sunblock so I wish I could have gotten a pre-tan so I wouldnt have to worry about sunburn.)

8. Have a map, compass, GPS Something to have a sense of direction. (Nothing is worse then being in a country you don't know well and getting lost in it. So please have a sense of direction or know where you are.)

9. Plan ahead. Know what you want to see/visit and know how long you want to stay there/how long it will take to get to and from there. Utilize the time you have. It is more valuable then money.) 

10. Have Fun. (Don't be afraid to stay out late, go far, be adventurous. This may be the only time you will ever be in Singapore so don't leave any stones unturned.)",matt_hobbo,sleeping a lot

>Think of it this way, MP can make BIGGER mistakes can still be seated with higher salaries ,why readers are not concern of these TOP gaman MP whom has make far more dangerous decisions ,yet we dont question them but for this young talent ,we want to gun him down?

>Anyway, I think he should have been given a 2nd chance for the 1st offence if that's indeed the REAL reason, and not that they missed it out. AND I think it could have been other scholarship, NOT MOE lah !! that's just sending the fox for training to guard the chicks...

>Let the man who have not watched or kept a single copy of pornography cast the first stone. This young man needs help. Can MOE do something to help him as it has given taxpayers money to develop him.

>Yeah...right now, almost all SG men who own or have access to a computer/s are guilty of having downloaded porn videos to watch. 

>The milder ones can be found everywhere amongst our SG men. Filming upshot photos, snapping couples doing public display of affection, snapping photos of women in compromising positions from afar, Watching porn, downloading porn vids, from PC, handphone etc. What is Singapore coming to? A land of men obsessed with sex????!!

>Poor guy! As a mother myself, my heart goes out to him! He committed such acts out of folly, and his bright future might go down the drain! Could there be clemency shown to him, after the necessary queries etc? Hope that there would be a kind of amicable outcome.

>It could be quite stressful to be a scholar, some took stress in their stride, some took to other forms of stress relief. In this case, this guy went to an sexual perversion.  What abt the ladies? What kind of stress relief do these gals take? Do they come into somewhat as extreme as this guy?

>Didn't this simply shows that your ministry of education is sleeping. No wonder you people learn to speaks singlish and half-cook mandarin at school and your MOE claimed that to be bi-lingual. You must be a dafts and quitters to believe singlish and half-cook mandarin are bi-lingual. Can you people get your MOE not to sleep or day dream at work.

>This guy is extremely gifted--not just with academic intelligence, but also can do calligraphy and play the guitar and piano and he can sing. (I actually didn't even know about his musical and calligraphy talent until I read about it recently) He has worked so hard for many years to build a future for himself--it is truly a pity that he might lose everything because of some bad tendencies he has inside himself. 

>Trust me, I was his ex-classmate and I am very sure that Jonathan earned his scholarship fair-and-square--through his merits instead of ""who you know"". Unlike many of my ex-classmates from HC Humanities Scheme, this guy is not rich and well-connected. He achieved so much so far by pure hard work combined with academic intelligence. I don't understand why you are questioning ""the quality of scholars""--according to your post. How many Singaporeans are as intelligent and talented as him?? That is the reason why he is given a scholarship and other Singaporeans are not. It is a great pity that all his brilliance might be wasted if he is put behind bars

>It's not too late to lend him some emotional support and encourage him to seek professional counselling. Let him know he still has friends who will not shy away from him and he may well have a chance to start life afresh.

>Thanks for your concern and compassion for him. Yup, that's what I did, I sent him an email 2 days ago expressing my sympathy for the position he's in. What he did was wrong, but it is not really for me to judge him--he is soon going to be judged by a court of law. 

>Yeah, if he watched adult porn, none of us would care. Watching child porn is DEFINITELY wrong, and I understand that--it aids a very very bad industry. But it is not as bad as personally creating the child porn films, nor is it as bad as molesting/raping a child. That is why I hope he does not have to lose a chance at his career and lose a chance at a normal life. I know there's a high chance he will be sentenced to jail, but I hope he isn't (at least hopefully not for a long time). This young man has spent his whole life working towards his future--does he really deserve to lose everything?

>People are taking the opportunity to throw far more stones at Jonathan (Jon) than he deserves. Yes, I know that he did commit a crime, and as an aspiring lawyer, I full well know the importance of punishing individuals for the crimes they commit. But the fact that he did commit a crime doesn't give anyone else the right to throw any more stones or call for the heaping of more punishment on him than commiserate to his crime. While his watching and possessing of child porn videos does provide fuel to an undesirable industry, his watching and possessing is does NOT mean that he was going around attacking children. I know Jon personally and I can vouch that he wasn't assaulting any children.

Lee Hsien Yang's most revealing interview yet with Yahoo News,33,6hddqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6hddqw/lee_hsien_yangs_most_revealing_interview_yet_with/,11,2017-06-15 22:46:11,"These are the parts not covered in other reports thus far. [Full Article](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pm-lees-new-stance-oxley-road-house-led-statement-wei-ling-hsien-yang-172956686.html)

Speaking to Yahoo Singapore over the phone on Wednesday night (14 June), Hsien Yang, 60, the younger son of the late Lee, said that it had been “painful” and “difficult” to issue the statement. “I feel sad. I never imagined it would come to this. But it’s the only sensible course of action.”

Hsien Yang noted that the late Lee’s will, which stated that the house was to be torn down when Wei Ling passed on or relocated, had been taken to probate. This means that the will had been officially certified in court.

**Frayed family ties beyond repair?**

“If Hsien Loong had any doubts (about the will), that was the time to come out and say, ‘Hey, there are some questions here, please, let’s address them in court’. He never raised them. In fact, he encouraged us to get probate,” said Hsien Yang.

Asked if he had been in touch with PM Lee since the joint statement was issued, or whether he planned to get in touch with him, Hsien Yang replied emphatically, “No.”

When asked whether there was any hope of reconciliation with his brother, Hsien Yang did not answer directly but recounted the dispute over the status of the house and PM Lee’s promise to recuse himself.

“And yet now, he goes to the cabinet committee and says ‘Oh, my father wasn’t quite so unwavering in his wish. You know, he would have accepted that the government has a right to do what it does’.  What is all this sophistry? What, are you quibbling and trying to play with words, to try and say that it might be all right?”

In their joint statement, the Lee siblings had claimed that they felt threatened and that “organs of the state” would be used against them. In this regard, Hsien Yang planned to leave Singapore “for the foreseeable future”.

Asked to elaborate, he said that some of his friends had suffered “serious repercussions”, adding, “They don’t want to be identified and they don’t want the issue to be raised. But there have been…a number of incidents which have caused hurt and pain to people.”

“I think you have to ask yourself: what did Lee Kuan Yew think? What did he want? 99 per cent of Singaporeans know what it is. They may or may not agree with him, but I think the vast majority of them would support honouring what he wanted. And yet, why are we in this position",mee_sua,I feel sad

Its work you can leave to the next day but yet people choose to rush through them when they don't get paid OT.

Its also sad that in F&B its so prevalent. I have friends working 15 hours everyday because either their outlets refuse to close or keep taking customers in. Its frustrating, and some chefs take it like a badge of honour. 

Its stupid as hell, its time you can spend for yourself, to recoup, to enjoy, and yet people are doing it just because they feel that they have to. It shouldn't be the employee responsibility to work OT without pay, but the employer to pay for OT or find someone else if necessary.

Halloween Horror Night Summary Review,172,9nftix,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9nftix/halloween_horror_night_summary_review/,56,2018-10-12 17:05:54,"Tl;dr: Only go if you're easily scared and if you are in a large group. Reach early, bring food and plenty of drinks.

Long Story:
Was there yesterday, ""off peak"". I feel like more people were there at off-peak either because they think there would be less people or because it's cheaper.

Anyway, I reached at 630pm and there was already a long queue. Gates open 7 but I was only in at 715 despite being the front quarter.

We were made to see an intro, which had already started when I went in. You can't see anything but a TV screen and so much EDM music I thought I was at Ultra. We were only given freedom at 730 and I hit Killuminati first.

It was good, but I was a bit sad when I waved at Killuminati and he yelled at me to ""get the hell out"".

I hit Stranger Things next, and this was dogshit and I'll explain in a bit.

Again, I'll explain next, but it took a while before I hit Pagoda much later at night.

Some notes for houses:

Queues are super long and this won't surprise you. Though you have 5 hours, I could only attend 3 houses. Prioritise. Queues went from 3hrs to 2hrs and even express pass holders were suffering.

Rainy season means either you are getting soaked or you are suffering the humid aftermath.

As for how the houses function, you are sent in in groups so it might get crowded and you might not feel as sp00ked. The Pagoda and Killuminati was OK, but there was literally a queue inside Stranger Things for some reason and everyone was laughing while waiting because they were examining the details which became cheaper with every passing minute. It was also a very short experience, not worth the insane queue time.

They're all temporary set-ups, too, no air-con or fans and only a sign telling you the backstory.


Also, you might miss some of the sp00ks or forsee them because it depends on luck, whether the actors and actresses scare you or the dude in front and you miss out.

Not saying any of these are wrong, just pointing out some stuff you might want to know.

I would recommend beelining for the other houses. Pontianak was apparently the scariest and had the longest queue, so shoot for that right away. The other 3 is fairly even, take whichever has the shortest queue.

Okay, remember what I said about food and drink? Obviously the merch is expensive, and as I said the weather sucks. Bring food and a big bottle of water, there are water coolers to refill at.

Scare zones were OK, but they were crowded. 

The shows, I only attended Dead Talks which was great, sit at the front or at the edges if you want to participate in the show. Arrive half an hour early, the place was fully packed by the time the show started. It's a comedy-dance typeish show.

Don't go to the cannibal show. Passed by it and it was so crowded and the stage was so small, you can't see anything from the back. The last show near the entrance I have no clue, I heard very loud rock music from the diner so I guess it can be good if you're there earlyish to get to the front rows.

Never went to Zombie Tag, seems like a waste of time.

Regular rides are open, but have long queues too.

One thing most might not have considered is going home. No MRTs or buses, only taxis. But everyone's thinking the same thing. The taxi stands at Vivo are packed with people and private vehicles from Grab. 

To give you an idea, Grab was demanding 40$, but Comfort was ""nice"" and asked for $25.

So add that to your expected costs.

Overall me and my friend both rated 6/10, we queued for 3 hours total and had about an hour of entertainment including 45 minutes of the show, so go figure. It was also really humid and it was raining intermittently.

The design and stuff was cool. My friend was screaming and so were other people.

I may be wrong, but I sometimes get the feeling that local people in this subreddit are reluctant to interact with foreigners.

Could you please share your (honest) feelings about ang mohs and explain why you feel that way? A little context would be very helpful (e.g. your age, how and where you interact with ang mohs etc.).

I'm not trying to start a flame war - just trying to understand if the negative sentiment towards foreigners that I think I'm feeling in modern Singapore really exists, and how I can improve my personal integration into your wonderful society.

I recently had an abortion in Singapore. Here's some updated information. Questions are welcome :),1288,5srn2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5srn2n/i_recently_had_an_abortion_in_singapore_heres/,325,2017-02-09 01:06:23,"I asked the mods if I could do a post with my throwaway, because information on this subreddit is quite outdated especially on prices of abortions. (Edited for formatting. Also warning: fairly long post though I tried to be as concise as possible)

**How I got pregnant**: accident of course. Boyfriend and I used to use condoms but I developed some sort of allergy to latex so we stopped using them. He never finishes in me, but we also had a lot of intercourse during my fertile period which was when I miraculously got knocked up. *In short, we were completely reckless*.

**How I found out**: late period. That's it. No other signs of pregnancy. When it was late by 2 weeks I decided to take the test over a period of 2 days. Both came out extremely positive.

**What we did**: abortion through a private clinic.

**Why private clinic over public hospital? Isn't that more expensive?**: No, it's not. It's like the exact same price, around 2k. I looked up info on this subreddit but most of it is really outdated. It's impossible to find an abortion for under 1k now, even in a public hospital. With a referral from a polyclinic, an abortion at KK Hospital is $900 to $1500 just for the procedure alone. Antibiotics, consultations, ultrasound scans, etc are all separate charges.

I'm guessing $900 is for an early pregnancy (8 weeks max) and $1500 is for those farther along. Most private clinics price like this too. The problem is, even if you make your appointment while being considered an early pregnancy, by the time you get to your appointment you'll be considered beyond 8 weeks already. Eg: chances are you find out you're pregnant at around 5 weeks (missing your period and waiting in vain for it to arrive), make an appointment (the earliest one for us was A MONTH LATER), and you'll be considered 9 weeks already and need to pay $1500. And a month is a long time - you'll probably start showing some symptoms by then, like morning sickness, which is horrible if you need this to be kept secret from your family and friends.

We initially wanted to go the public route as we thought it would be cheaper, but since their earliest appointment date was a month later (and time is of the essence in this situation), we looked up private clinics that do abortions and found the price to be pretty much the same but MUCH faster. If you call on a Friday, you can go for the consultation and scan on Saturday, then Tuesday is the actual abortion procedure. And you go back for a checkup one week later, that's all there is to it.

For both private and public routes, you can use your MediSave. Up to $900, if I'm not wrong. The problem is that's not anonymous. If you don't wish for anyone to find out, especially your parents, you shouldn't use MediSave.

**The counseling part of this whole abortion shebang**: I had to be ""counseled"" twice since we tried to go through the public route first but went through private in the end. The polyclinic immediately sent me to a different room to be counseled. It was just some old lady telling me that my baby can feel that I don't want it and it's sad, and it can feel all the pain and sadness and I need to apologize to it if I decide to go through with the abortion. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH IF YOU WISH TO ABORT, if you bother to research you will know IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FETUS TO FEEL THESE THINGS UNTIL IT'S A LATE TERM PREGNANCY. **DO NOT LET THEM GUILT TRIP YOU INTO KEEPING AN UNWANTED CHILD YOU ARE NOT PREPARED FOR**.

Private clinic counseling was easy, I just watched a video on how abortions are done and the risks behind it.

That's pretty much all the pertinent information I can think of right now. If you have any questions you can comment and I'll reply ASAP. If you wish to keep it private you can PM me, I will do my best to help you",aborted_in_SG,I feel sad

RANT: Why this step motherly policy by Singapore hospitals towards foreign residents?,1,42e4b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/42e4b4/rant_why_this_step_motherly_policy_by_singapore/,47,2016-01-24 18:37:50,"WARNING: Long rant ahead

Long-time lurker posting for the first time. Have been a resident of Singapore since 4 years. Originally South Asian who moved here from the US after finishing graduate school. In the US, we just went to the hospital, showed insurance card, get treated for as long as it takes, and go home. The insurance and hospital discuss and send me the finalized bill, usually around 10% of the final bill, usually after a month of discharge. I then settle that bill, sometimes even using instalments. In fact, once the hospital even waived that 10% because I was a poor graduate student! 

When I first moved here, I realized that my employer (now former) wants me to pay the ENTIRE bill during hospitalization first, no matter even if its 100,000 and then claim back (which of course takes a couple of months). So, I bought a private shield plan for which the company said they will settle with the hospital so that the entire visit is cashless. This was in 2013. This time when I was to purchase shield plan for my wife,, my agent dropped this on me: All resident foreigners (S/EP holders) now need to pay the bill upfront and only then claim from the insurance. Apparently they changed the policy in Nov 2015 because ""For e.g. Mt. Elizabeth saw many cases where foreigners from Indonesia, Malaysia just ran away from their hospital beds without paying the bill"". Singaporeans and PR’s are exempt because “they cannot escape lah, they got CPF”. Of course my current employer provides LOG for a certain amount so I am okay for small bills but I simply feel discriminated and sad from this policy.

So much for “one of the most efficient healthcare in the world” that puts money first prior to treating patients. For all the criticism that US faces for its healthcare system and insurance, I strongly felt that they put human life first, and money comes much later. In fact, not treating someone for not having insurance is illegal in the US. 
Reddiporeans, please help me understand:
1. Why this step motherly treatment towards resident foreigners? Our lives and jobs are based in Singapore. There is no way we will run away when so much is at stake. Why treat us no better than second class citizens or visiting foreigners despite us contributing equally as everyone else? 
2. Is it true that all foreigners have to now pay upfront without private insurance settling the bill while hospitalized? Or, was my agent just protecting her company for change of their own policy?
3. Are you aware of any private insurance companies offering cashless hospitalization insurance plans?

TL; DR: Hospitals in Singapore need RESIDENT foreigners (S, EP holders) to pay the entire amount upfront as if we are visitors to this country. Why such treatment when our lives are tied to Singapor",dhampugenbas,I feel sad
[Discussion] Amos Yee v Wee Shu Min,19,33gcr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/33gcr2/discussion_amos_yee_v_wee_shu_min/,51,2015-04-23 00:17:51,"In light of the recent furore over Amos Yee being charged, I'd like to bring /r/Singapore's attention to a particular incident nine years ago.

Presenting: Then-18-year-old Wee Shu Min, daughter of AMK GRC MP Wee Siew Kim, another teenager who offending society with her disparaging remarks and failed to apologise for it, only for her father to do it for her.

*(For those of you who still remember this, skip to the end for the tl;dr)*

**Part 1:** It started with blogger Derek Wee (not related), who is a degree-holding middle class Singaporean but found that Singapore is not a good environment to retire in because the Government can't relate to Singaporeans.

Part of his blog post: 

""It’s sad but true, Singapore no longer is a place where one can hope to work hard their lives and retire graciously. It’s really the push factor. A future is something we sweat it out, build and call our own. Unfortunately, people like me, mid 30’s going on 40’s, staying put by choice or otherwise, we can’t help but feel what lies ahead is really a gamble.

""To PM Lee and the Ministers, we are on a different platform. Until you truly understand our insecurity, the future of Singapore to me remains a question mark.""

**Part 2:** Enter Wee Shu Min. She goes on a vitriolic rant on her blog about middle and lower class Singaporeans and their sense of entitlement (ironic, considering her rich upbringing).

Her post:

""dear derek is one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world. 

""one of those who would prefer to be unemployed and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner’s, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant. 

""it’s not even about being a road sweeper. these shitbags don’t want anything without “manager” and a name card. 

""please, get out of my elite uncaring face.” 

**Part 3:** Her father, MP Wee Siew Kim pretty much endorsed her elitist remarks with a half-hearted apology. 

He told Straits Times: """"I think if you cut through the insensitivity of the language, her basic point is reasonable.

""Some people cannot take the brutal truth and that sort of language, so she ought to learn from it."" 

**tl;dr:** 1) Blogger says it's hard to build money for retirement in Singapore and MPs don't understand what the lower/middle class are going through 2) Wee Shu Min goes on rant against 'shitbag' lower/middle class Singaporeans 3) Her father, MP Wee Siew Kim, apologies but endorses her views.

This was the incident which made it clear that elitism is a real divide in Singapore.[ You can read this site for more information about the backlash and impact it had.](https://intelligentsingaporean.wordpress.com/wee-shu-min/)

*I hope everyone can have a well thought-out, civilised discussion about this to enhance each other's perspective.*

*Possible discussion topics:* Should Wee Shu Min have been punished too? What makes Amos Yee's offences worse that he ends up in court? Should Wee Siew Kim be made to step down as MP (will you want him as MP",mrdoriangrey,I feel sad

I am a gay, American student that lived in Singapore for a year (all of 2012), fell in love, and then moved back to the states to finish school. I graduate next May, and my boyfriend graduates in May 2015. 

I've been in a long distance relationship with my Singaporean boyfriend for the last 9 months, and I feel like we need a clear cut plan that will get us together in the future. 

Now marriage isn't something I've been considering lightly but, I fully intend to ask him to marry me when I visit Singapore next January. Now I'm starting to design and make our wedding bands, but I'm still not sure what I should do for the actual proposal. It doesn't need to be extravagant, something simple, meaningful and romantic will do...

Our first date ever was at the Singapore Flyer. I know that they used to allow groups to rent out a whole capsule for company events, and I was thinking along those lines, but the price is so extravagant! (plus I'm concerned with the financial stability of the flyer)

He has told me that his romantic dream date would to lay under the stars.... which makes me sad because the stars are so hard to see in Singapore. I would just wait until he comes back over to America for me to propose, but we aren't sure when that might actually happen.

I've been all over Singapore, but I would love to hear some suggestions from you guys! I know a proposal is a very personal thing, however, I just need some ideas to get the ball rolling! Stories of your friends' proposals, romantic things to do, anything!

[Discussion] Ilo Ilo - A really over rated movie,4,1ztbvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ztbvp/discussion_ilo_ilo_a_really_over_rated_movie/,2,2014-03-08 07:37:04,"I just watched Ilo Ilo(late to the party I know), the local movie that won several overseas film awards, and I believe that it has been over hyped and is not the kind of movie that is groundbreaking or particularly enlightening. 

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

I feel that Ilo Ilo is not an outstanding movie because I see it as an ordinary film that dealt with trite issues that Singaporeans face, and it did not explore them in a skillful way that would cause an audience familiar with such issues to change the way they think about them. It reminded me of a restrained Jack Neo movie with perfunctory arthouse film attributes.

But that is not to say it is an average movie simply because it explores well discussed issues. After all, the theme of war is one that is commonly discussed in film, but we have one great film/series after another about war(Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Letters from Iwo Jima) because they are able to affect the mostly unblemished population of viewers who have never been touched by the horror of war, and change their perspective towards it. Even combat veterans of war are deeply affected by such films because of their realistic, unabashed look at the suffering they went through. For those who are unfamiliar with the experience and those who know it well, they all have their own unique takeaway from such great films that can affect them on a personal level.

Let's examine the setting of a movie. We have a typical working class Singaporean household which has fallen on hard times because of the 1997 Asian Financial crisis. They were living a relatively comfortable life (had a car, both parents were employed , has a piano in the house, able to hire a maid) and hence struggle with their changing financial situation(father lost job, lost money playing stocks, unable to find a job because of a lack of qualifications, mother constantly stresses over job security). Incidentally, this is almost the same setting and situation of the 1998 movie Money No Enough. 

The son is constantly acting up after the death of the his grandfather who was the sole parental figure in the son's life, a point which is made painfully obvious by the mother who says ""he was a lot better behaved when the grandfather was around"". The mother ironically doesn't make the next logical step in deducing that the boy has been acting up because he lacks a parental figure at home, and remains completely oblivious to the cause of the worsening behaviour of her son. Because where would the drama otherwise come from if the mother did not fall into the Channel 8/Jack Neo cliche of busy parents neglecting their children causing bad behaviour to transpire? This is a dead horse that has been flogged more times in contemporary Singaporean culture and media than the annual haze, and is also an issue in any society that has a majority of households with 2 working parents. It's safe to say that Anthony Chen isn't breaking any unexplored OB markers here. 

And like a bad sitcom/soap opera plot that wishes to show the growing dysfunction in a family, the film has the mother constantly pouting and showing resentment at the maid who she thinks is taking over her role in the household, in case you missed all those other scenes of the maid and the son bonding and the son overtly expressing his affection for the maid. If that overacting wasn't enough to convince you of the state of disintegration in the family unit, it certainly helped that the mother was consistently portrayed as a complete asshole who never had anything pleasant to say save wishing the son a happy birthday.  The father is also shown to be slowly giving less and less of a fuck, as seen by his smoking in different settings(which his wife disapproves of), from the staircase outside his house, inside his car, and then in his house. Really, all you need is a laugh track and you have an episode of one of those sitcoms when a guest star becomes somebodies new best friend, and things are taken for granted, etc. 

While you may argue that as supporting characters this is a cliche one can afford to abide, I felt that this was especially bad for the film because the negative space created by their neglect defines the state of the relationship between the boy and his maid. And the relationship that results is that of the stereotypical odd couple who hate each other at first but gradually becomes firm friends in the  isolation they face. This is a plot done so many times in movies I really would not care to list the examples down here. And as a Singaporean, we all know of the urban legends(well maybe not so much legend as fact) of children who grow so attached to their maid that the domestic worker effectively displace the mother as the maternal figure. To reiterate, this film touched upon a common issue in society and has the characters behave in the most stereotypical way possible. The main problem I have with the movie is that when it is dealing with a realistic subject matter and is obviously aiming to be as close to point as possible, I cannot reconcile the soap opera like nature of the story and the acting with the realism this movie is supposed to convey. When I see the family in Ilo Ilo, I don't go ""Hey, that looks a lot like my family/someones family I know"" but ""hey it has superficial aspects of the Singaporean family unit, like what I saw at 9 o clock on Channel 8 last night!"". The melodramatic nature of the mother and son's acting did not help to dispel this perception. Mother/son had no semblance of character progression whatsoever which is extremely detrimental for a film like Ilo Ilo.

I thought that one of the tropes that Chen could have fleshed out is the conflict/stability which the maid as an alien figure in an already dysfunctional family can bring. This was of course explored, but in a clunky way that resorts to using too many cliches. All this could have been avoided however, if there was a proper resolution to the dynamic shift that the maid brought about. Instead, like a bad sitcom endeavouring to wrap up the plot(again) the source of conflict is conveniently sent away because the family could not afford to pay the maid anymore. The son is predictably sad, and the mother's reaction is mild relief, because she can go back to becoming BFF's with her son. 

I felt that this film is somewhat redeemed in the director's ability to capture poignancy in the little vignettes of the characters lives, from the maid's helplessness and isolation and the son's admirable child like loyalty to the memory of his grandfather. But other than that, this film to me seems a typical family drama that tells no new stories and asks no new questions of the audience. Perhaps being a Singaporean has afforded me a unique perspective on this movie that clouds my judgment, something which those foreign movie festival judges do not have, but hey I'm no film critic.

What are possible reasons that could be attributed to Singapore's bad reputation of abusing helpers?,23,9bukhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9bukhy/what_are_possible_reasons_that_could_be/,38,2018-09-01 07:28:18,"I'm no Singapore shillbot but I have always been proud of my country but this issue sticks out like a sore thumb. 

There has been articles of employers giving a petty sum to helpers for their food budget. Articles about giving helpers instant noodles and white bread daily. Reports of helpers going mad after being abused and killing their employers.


IMO my main reason would be that Asians have been drilled that money = power. That if you don't get a good job you are inferior to others that do. Thus since they're paying their helpers salary they project their power dynamic and see their helpers as ""useless"" ""stupid"" ""inferior"" etc.

I get that they are hired to help, and of course you'd put your family member ahead of them, but don't you feel shitty putting another human through all that? They leave their families behind, some have kids they are away from. 

My family doesn't believe in giving her internet access (I personally feel this can be considered a human right because we are in a country where EVERYONE has it, and letting her use our wifi isn't going to cost much, if anything.) So you'd rather she spend what little money she has on phone cards just to speak to her family?

Or people saying that giving the helper their own room, or treating them like family is too much, ""pampering them"". If you can afford it, why not? You pay them, but that doesn't mean you own them, they spend more time in your house than you do, why wouldn't you be nice to them????

I don't have a problem with hiring a helper, but I do think it makes zero sense and shows how much of a shitty person you are if you treat them as lesser than you. 

And I know sometimes helpers do take advantage. Unfortunately shitty people come in all types so yeah, you might get a rotten egg but is that really a reason to deny a ""proven"" good helper some basic rights and privileges?

Okay consider this a rant, I can hear my grandma screaming at the helper from next door, and its triggering my righteous yet ultimately useless anger UGH.

Edit 2: Okay guys I didn't intend to trash talk my family, they're perfectly normal people who do have other things to deal with than their mother (who does need a helper) verbally abusing said helper.

Also, I said only that my grandma was screaming at the maid, and that they didn't want to give her WiFi access (Yes, I slipped her the password anyway).

Amongst other things, they've decided to place salted fish on the common corridor, let their pet cat roam, piss and crap around my mother's potted plants, and, the piece de resistance, singing karaoke nearly everyday to piss me off.

Influx of Degree holders- Diploma need not apply?,0,86mxgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/86mxgc/influx_of_degree_holders_diploma_need_not_apply/,10,2018-03-24 10:28:59,"Hello! :x

I am rather interested in the fact that the government has been increasing the number of places in our local universities in the past few years. Close to 2 decades ago, the cohort participation rate(the % of each cohort that goes onto uni) was 20%. Gradually, this became 30% in 2013, to 35% last year. In two years time, 40%.

I am quite concerned that with this influx of degree holders, the value of a diploma will be diluted. Further, the increase in the number of degree holders itself might also dilute the value of a local uni degree, not forgetting the distinctions that the prospective employers make among graduates of the Big 3 local unis from the upcoming 3. 

This seems to be a lose-lose situation at first glance.

Furthermore, is a degree really necessary? 

I have heard quite a few times that what people studied in uni wasn't really relevant to what they're doing, which relates, on one hand to the mismatch in education outcomes (how effective are the Uni's advertised hands-on technical competencies suited to the working environment's needed skills really? In some cases, it reminds me of secondary school where hands-on activities were rather useless?), and, on the other hand, the underemployment of graduates in certain sectors.

Yikes! Hehe. That was a long sentence. _

Does the economy need this many graduates?

Of course, a standard rebuttal is that a more educated workforce can't be worse right? This presumes that universities actually usefully educates one. Sooooo, r/Singapore, did you feel that you became more enlightened, educated in the course of your degree? Do you think you would have such growth outside universities? Or have you learned more by being in the workforce over the years as compared to uni?

Some background info about me. I went to a 6 year IP Secondary School/Junior College. I'm an introvert, was a loner, had only 1-2 good friends, stuck with gaming for the first 3-4 years.

Fast forward to JC1, i am taking PCME H1 econs. Grades are really bad since i have no motivation to learn useless subjects just for a certificate that would allow me to enter a Uni. I have shit year 4 results, O level equivalent would be around 28 points.

I also got bored of gaming in early JC1 and quit gaming cold turkey. I am sort of a loner, didn’t fit in with my male classmates as all were on the very noisy, rowdy, gaming spectrum.

Also, I have very severe eczema that is hindering my ability to carry out activities that require sweating & sometimes even walking and also studies. I feel as if the JC curriculum is just not for me due to the immense amount of stress. It also took a turn for the worse 1-2 weeks ago where I had to “sleep off the pain”.

However, i am very interested in AI, cryptocurrency trading & blockchain technologies. Also am founder of a small project in cryptocurrencies & have a sizeable stack from trading/investing. I want to pick up programming, mainly C++, Python, Javascript & Solidity to potentially prepare for my career in the cryptocurrency space.

Thus, i am thinking of dropping out from JC to Poly and taking up an information technology (IT) course as I thought it would help me build a good foundation for potential further studies in University or for my future career. I am appealing to all polys except temasek. Have sent an email to them but have not received any replies yet. I am very worried about not being able to enter a poly & my desired course. Also my prelims start a few hours later & i'm not very optimistic about even subpassing. Do Polys look at JC1 grades as reference too?

I understand that my case is very unique, but I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation before.


TLDR

Have shit grades, social issues, severe eczema, but very interested in blockchain/crypto technology. Am worried about not getting into my desired course in Poly.

Edit: just to clarify, i'm JC1 ",rebelzrocks,I feel useless
What's up with the unfavourable perception towards the creatives?,27,76ko31,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/76ko31/whats_up_with_the_unfavourable_perception_towards/,12,2017-10-16 10:24:07,"I'm puzzled by why the general perception towards creatives (arts, design, writer, musician, etc) are rather...depressing; if one doesn't have a deep pocket full of cash, nor well-connected to the upper echelon of the social caste, nor 'accredited' overseas, one is deemed to be economically useless, forever a bachelor, relies on welfare handouts, ill-fated to the bottom rung of the ladder. (smells like the life of Charlie Chan Hock Chye, anyone?)

If submitting to a grim future outlook isn't enough, the creative has to be on guard for cheapskates looking to low-ball or exploit with ""free exposure"", or blatant plagiarism/theft by people. Why do they have to resort to such unethical tactics?

I haven't keep up with the current times on the arts and design other than what's reported in the media and on the net, so my opinions may be outdated.

An alternative approach for doing well in GP,79,4g81ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4g81ji/an_alternative_approach_for_doing_well_in_gp/,42,2016-04-25 04:57:37,"*[I had previously written this as a reply to someone who had asked for advice regarding A-Level GP, but once I pressed submit I realised that he had deleted his entire post. Thought it'd be a waste to discard everything I had typed out for him/her, so here it is for the reading pleasure of any other interested student here.]*


&nbsp;


GP was my favourite subject in JC. I never believed in studying for it because it simply isn't something you can study for in the traditional sense. Memorising phrases and reading model essays is plain rubbish – I've seen so many schoolmates do that, which, in my opinion, is absolutely pointless. Do that for maths or physics, yes, but not GP.


Instead, my strategy for GP, at least for the essay component, is essentially this: Pick a topic or two you are truly interested in and passionate about and just solely focus on them. The exam has many essay questions but the themes are always consistent (i.e. there will always be one question on human rights, one on consumerism, one on technology, one on sports, one on education, and so on). So pick the topic(s) which you really like and from now on only read up on those and write essays on those. Don't bother about the rest. You're bound to already have an opinion on things you're interested in, so from then on it's just a matter of (i) clearly expressing that opinion on paper, and (ii) finding the right evidence to substantiate your points.


&nbsp;


For (i), it’s all about reading, reading, and reading. The best way to master a language is through immersion, and I believe that holds true even for languages you are already familiar with. You can always read opinion pieces or random articles to get a feel of what is good writing (but choose carefully!), or go the traditional route and read actual books. Fiction certainly has fancier styles of writing, but remember that you’re writing an argumentative essay, not a short story, so it may be better to stick to non-fiction. But ultimately I feel that it doesn’t really matter; it’s more important to be engaged in what you’re reading, as opposed to forcing yourself to struggle through a boring tome that you will remember nothing about anyway.

You don't even have to *read* per se; personally I'm fond of listening to Stephen Fry's random speeches and podcasts and debates (and occasionally his quite-interesting TV show QI), all available by searching his name on YouTube; his posh British accent magically gives a +10 to writing for me. I won't guarantee that it will work for you, but it's worth a try, and anyway the way in which he argues his points is something you can adapt for your writing too.

But don't just blindly copy someone else's style because you'll never get it exactly right and it'll end up sounding forced, or worse, fake. All that reading is just to familiarise yourself with proper grammar and syntax (personally I hate using complicated and obscure words favoured by many GP teachers because it makes you sound pretentious; you may feel otherwise and that's fine as long as you manage to do it well); you still have to develop a writing style of your own.


&nbsp;


For (ii), it's really about wide exposure. This is where your choice of topic comes in. If you have no interest in a particular topic it is useless to force yourself to read articles and news about it because nothing gets absorbed. On the other hand if you're interested in something you will naturally seek out information about it. For example, I always write the human rights / crime / politics questions so there's never a shortage of content in the news (e.g. nowadays the hot talking points are the European refugee crisis / terrorism and balancing security vs freedom / the PC and outrage culture gripping the West).

If you're interested in something else you may have to look harder, but the content is always there.

Focus is also important – I've noticed that a lot of people tend to only write about Singaporean issues and examples, which I feel severely limits the potential of your essay. It's good if you have chosen to specialise in Singapore and can expand heavily on your points, but otherwise you may wish to instead frame your essay in an international perspective. Tactically speaking, your assessors at Cambridge are British anyway, so there's always the added advantage of your essay being more relatable to them if you write about international issues instead of local ones. If you *must* bring in Singapore in your essay, then perhaps you can first write broadly about an issue faced by the world, then evaluate how the prevailing solution applies / does not apply to Singapore because of whatever reason, which will also score you bonus points for analysis and contextualising to your own experiences.

Obviously, the biggest caveat to this is to defer to the requirements of the question – if the question specifically asks you to write about your country's experiences *only*, then it'd do you no good to do otherwise!


&nbsp;


In my experience, it was never really about *what* you wrote that mattered, but rather *how* you bring your points across, and how the examples you cite serve to complement and reinforce your main argument, that made the difference between an outstanding and a mediocre essay. Hell, even if you completely made up your examples in a pinch, I doubt it'd matter much so long as they are believable and you put your points across cogently.

Again, if you’re truly interested in the topic then naturally you will hold a strong opinion one way or another. Strong opinions are important if you want to convince the reader that your arguments are sound. And convincing your reader all but guarantees you a high mark. Then it’s all about practice to make sure your arguments make sense, are backed by evidence, and can’t be easily shot down.


&nbsp;


Lastly, it's very important to build a strong relationship with your teacher, even more so if you're not that strong in GP. If you show that you're genuinely interested in improving, then I'm sure your teacher will be more than happy to help you during consults etc. Once you have the content down you just need your teacher to help you refine your writing.

There's honestly no need to rely on tuition if you have a good teacher and are proactive in reading up on your own.


&nbsp;


Once you start working, you'll realise that GP is really the only subject that remains relevant after you graduate – good writing is extremely difficult to come by, and if you can master it then you're already at a significant advantage above others. If you're fortunate to get a chance to do staff work in NS at any level (be it as a staff assistant, clerk, admin supervisor, or staff officer), then you'll discover these benefits even earlier.

I feel like becoming increasingly negative and cynical after listening to all the things people say about foreigners and Indians and Chinese in particular.

The last straw was when recently I was in the car of one of my superiors of the company I work in. And this guy was someone I looked up to. And in front of me he used terms like Permanent Rubbish and Foreign Trash like I was supposed to agree with him. He was complaining like the typical thing you find on facebook and the Asia One forums. Useless foreigners drive up property prices, he even said that we should never have given these foreigners any PR or Citizenship. He said we should be like Saudi Arabia and UAE where we just bring in the workers to do the dirty jobs and send them packing once they've outlived their usefulness. This is a educated, wealthy guy who wears a $10,000 watch and lives in a upper end condo. As someone who is considering making Singapore my permanent home (i.e citizenship), this hurt me.

I'm an ultra liberal, I am all for a united world even a world where there are no countries. Maybe this is due to my liberal California University education, but why is it so hard to find people who think alike, why am I looked down upon even by the educated, why do people use terms like trash and rubbish to describe me.

The other day I made a call to a real estate agent  and he promptly said no Indians allowed. I looked at my Singaporean friend next to me and he said ""well its their apartment, if they don't want to rent an apartment to an Indian its their choice"".

I feel like the racism is too prevalent, I've travelled all over and I've never experience any explicit racism other than Singapore. And if I was ever subjected to racism in the US,UK or Philippines I know I would have 10 locals to back me up. But in Singapore somehow racism is understandable because of the ""situation"".

I want everyone to get along, I want to live in a place where nobody sees my race at all. I lived years in countries where the fact that I was Indian was never brought up, I was just another guy. I feel like getting angrier to, I don't want to become negative living here, I'm an optimist all about world peace, that is my biggest worry, that I become racist too. So help me out r/Singapore, tell me things are improving. Singapore is my dream country, I chose it over countries that even Singaporeans want to emigrate to, tell me I didn't make a mistake. Even if I get citizenship, maybe I will just be a new citizen trash.

On downvotes,72,2fsm6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2fsm6a/on_downvotes/,11,2014-09-09 01:39:37,"**tl;dr The downvote arrow will stay. You can help by voting up posts that have been unreasonably downvoted (e.g. valid, constructive posts at -1)**


We understand that even though internet points generally do not matter, they are part of the reason why reddit has thrived and grew so much. The health of the subreddit depends on it, whether for self-moderation or morale. This issue is legitimate and shouldn't be ignored for being unimportant.

**Explanation**

We don't know the cause of these downvotes. It could be any or a combination of the following:

1. Scripts/bots (nothing we can do)
2. Concentrated downvote brigade (we do not know who)
3. Redditors unfamiliar with reddiquette (sidebar)
4. Redditors familar with reddiquette and chose to not follow it (no way to enforce this)

**Consequences of removing the button**

The only users this change will affect are the ones browsing reddit natively on their web browsers. This will not affect

1. Mobile client users (AlienBlue, reddit is fun, BaconReader, RedditSync)
2. Mobile site users (i.reddit.com, m.reddit.com)
3. Users who switched the subreddit CSS off
4. RES users (with keyboard shortcuts)
5. Responses in inbox
6. Frontpage submissions

As you can probably tell, this is a large portion of redditors. Anyone who is determined enough to spend their time downvoting posts in this subreddit will not be hampered by the restrictions put in place.

Instead, **normal site users will be handicapped with the removal of the button**, by not being able to downvote posts that *should* be downvoted. Low-quality posts will also rise up at a similar speed to the higher-quality posts without downvotes for moderation. Posts such as misinformation, spreading of personal information, ad hominem attacks, trolls, spam -- all these are supposed to be downvoted in the first place.

[Watch This Film!] Ramen Teh by Director Eric Khoo,3,8az220,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8az220/watch_this_film_ramen_teh_by_director_eric_khoo/,3,2018-04-10 07:00:25,"Greetings /r/SG! This post is a review of the film Ramen Teh, which was released in GV cinemas on 29 March. The [trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/82ty7m/ramen_teh_a_film_by_eric_khoo_starring_mark_lee/) was posted on this subreddit about a month ago and this was how i got to know about this film. Unlike other international films with local actors, this film has Jeanette Aw (my first waifu at a young age. I mean, who else would you designate your waifu if you had to go through local drama from the 2000s? The ISFP vibe is strong with lots of the characters she plays) in it. This was the reason I wanted to watch the film upon seeing the trailer. 


From this point on, there will be **Spoilers:**


From the trailer, the plot is basically revealed in the first 45 seconds. There are no drastic twists in terms of storytelling. With that said, the meat of the film comes with how it shows the relationships between people with food as the medium for communication. The tune that plays in the trailer (1min19sec onwards), which I take to be the theme song of the film from this point on, has a hopeful journeyman vibe to it. I find that it works better in the trailer than in the film itself though.

**Disclaimers** 
#1 I've only watched this movie once, so I will have omitted many details in the follow review. I'd be pleased if your comments help to point out what i've missed out so that the other readers can have a better idea of what the film is about. 


#2 I watched this in the cinema, so there will not be any screenshots of segments of the film in this review. I know discussions are often enhanced by such screenshots, but it is not something that I can provide here. I do have a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/b8sdD) of the movie exhibit though!


#3 I am terrible with names of characters in any sort of media. Hence, I shall refer to the characters by using generic titles in storytelling. 


#4 This review will largely follow the sequence of the film as part of its structure, so spoilers are to be expected.


#5 Even as a Singaporean, I admit to not knowing the nooks and crannies of the country. You will have to forgive me for allowing locations that are showcased to fly over my head.
//


**Pre-movie**
    The cinema hall I watched this movie in was only 10% filled since it was a weekday afternoon. Based on the glance I took before the movie started, the audience were mostly young adults in their mid-20s-to-30s. Honestly though, this sample size is too small to draw any sort of conclusion. Pre-show advertisements lasted only 14 minutes, which I found to be a relief. Thankfully, the advertisements did not showcase any high octane action sequences, which might have upset the mood of the audience before this film.


**Arc 1: Yearning** 
    The opening sequence of the film is largely similar to what is shown in the trailer. We see a ricefield in Takasaki in what seems to be the morning. We are then shown how ramen is prepared before the main character (MC), his father and his uncle are first introduced in the family ramen restaurant. MC quips that if he were a bowl of ramen, his father might actually pay more attention to him. The yearning for connection with his father seems to be the motivation for MC at this point. 

We later learn that it is the anniversary of MC's mother's death. MC's father is shown drinking sake to drown his sorrows after closing the restaurant for the night. 

In a bid to connect with his father, MC tinkers with spice ingredients he receives in the mail so that he can produce a ramen recipe that his father would enjoy. We are shown the father-son interaction for the only time through a breakfast scene where the pair merely exchange a few lines of dialogue before they part ways.

As MC and his uncle begin to start work for the day at the ramen restaurant, they find MC's father on the kitchen floor, presumably fallen from heartbreak/grief/heart attack.

In remembering his brother after his death, MC's uncle states that ramen creation was an endeavor pursued by MC's father when his wife (they might not have been married at this point) first visited Japan with him. In this sense, he has a yearning for making people happy through ramen creation.


**Arc 2: Seeking**
    With his parents permanently removed from his life, MC seeks to retain their memories through any means possible. He stumbles across his father's belongings at home and manages to find photographs of the past. They show his parents when they were young and a few photographs of his childhood. He also comes across a diary that belonged to his mother. The text within it were in Mandarin characters, so he is unable to decipher them at this point in time. Yet, the photographs and pictures within it were sufficient to help him decide on his next course of action.

With a heavy heart, MC leaves his Shiba Inu, Kota, with an elderly couple. I was not fully paying attention to the subtitles at this point, but I think they were related to him? Regardless, the one true ship in this movie has sailed (MC Masato x Best Doggo Kota ftw!).

Upon setting foot in Singapore, MC tries to find the old Bak Kut Teh (BKT) restaurant that his maternal uncle used to work at. However, when he visits the last known address, all MC finds is a dilapidated and uninhabited shop. 

His next order of business is to locate the scenes from the stash of photographs he has in his possession. This process is akin to reliving the memory of photographs by visiting the real life counterparts. (If the locations from these photographs still exist, then I am able to visit a memory from the past that I can find comfort in.)

With no other method of contacting his maternal uncle, MC's only point of contact in Singapore is now the food blogger who owns the gourmet journey site from earlier. She introduces MC to Hainanese chicken rice. As per the theme of seeking, MC is open to new experiences and he finds Singaporean food delicious. 


**Arc 3: Discovering**
    After some asking around with food blogger, MC is able to locate his maternal uncle at Tuan Yuan (reunion) BKT restaurant. MC is not recognised at first, but after showing his uncle a photograph of his family and the letter sent to his family, MC and his uncle hug.

MC is invited to his uncles household, where the traditional chinese 3Dish1Soup dinner is served. MC, being a sucker for soups, finds this meal delicious as well. 

The pair then discuss MC's mother's diary and dying wishes over peanuts and beer. MC also requests to learn BKT preparation from his uncle. This is in line with his attempts to remember his parents through making BKT.

His uncle agrees and wakes MC up at 4am to start BKT preparation. They go through details of how the pork ribs are chosen and cut. MC also learns how the broth should be prepared ahead of time. 


**Arc 3.5: Struggling**
    By this point, we have been shown several sporadically-spaced scenes that detail the past. We know that MC's parents met in Singapore in the 1980s. Being stationed in Singapore, MC's father would spend his off-days trying out BKT from different places. He meets his would-be wife at one such place. The two are able to communicate in English and Japanese.

Soon, they fall in love. After dating for a year and a half, they decide to inform her mother (aka MC's maternal grandmother). With memories of the Japanese Occupation still etched in her mind, MC's grandmother is unable to accept a marital union between MC's parents. She threatens to sever familial ties if the pair proceed with their marriage. 

We see the struggle for acceptance being highlighted here. Throughout the film, we witness multiple attempts of mixing vastly different ingredients together. Firstly, MC's maternal grandparents were able to combine aspects of Teochew and Cantonese cuisine, which resulted in the family recipe for BKT. Next, MC's parents were steadfast in their relationship, which resulted in the birth of MC (a child of mixed blood). Then, the show also mentions that ramen is a recent creation that has roots in Chinese and Japanese cuisine. *Hence, MC-kun is actually a bowl of ramen!* Finally, the titular Ramen Teh is a fusion between BKT and ramen. The dish represents MC's attempt at reconciling his Singaporean childhood (up to age 10, when his mother passed away) and his Japanese life after this event.

MC undergoes the anger stage of grief when he realises how his maternal grandmother's refusal to accept his parents' union was a regret that his mother carried up to her death.

It is around here that the controversy surrounding the naming of the [Surviving the Japanese Occupation: War and its Legacies gallery](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/war-gallery-name-change-a-timeline) is shown via a news report. Assuming that this is based on our universe, then the story would 'currently' take place around February 2017. 

Reconcilation happens in two forms. The first is the internal kind based on emotional hang ups. This happens for MC, MC's mother and even MC's grandmother. The second is external and based on the history and relations between people. We see internal reconciliation occurring when the characters convince themselves to think differently while external reconciliation occurs when characters make peace through their actions. 


**Arc 4: Connecting**
    MC and his maternal grandmother are unable to communicate verbally as they do not share a common spoken language. When MC bursts into a tirade at his grandmother's doorstep, she can only see anger and grief directed at her, so she responds in kind. The diary that MC's mother penned serves as the first means of communication between grandmother and grandson.

The second means of communication is established when MC prepares his first rendition of ramen teh for his grandmother. He comes to this decision after visiting the WWII exhibition mentioned earlier and hearing of the tale of the baby and the bayonet. By enlisting the help of [ramen chef Keisuke Takeda](http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/weekend-interview/keisuke-takeda) and his maternal uncle, MC is able to fine-tune his ramen teh creation such that they meet his expectations and suit the context of Singapore's taste/climate. 

Upon receiving and eating ramen teh, grandma also finds that food is delicious. She agrees to establish a third method of communication with MC. She promises to teach him the recipes that were written in MC's mother's diary. 

The final stretch of the movie shows how blood is thicker than obstacles in life. MC's mother is invoked through food recipes and external reconciliation is made. The hatchet is buried because food is delicious.


**Arc 5: Settling**
    The consumption of food can be a ritualised activity that allows for social bonding. Many cultures express love through the sharing of food. The time and energy invested in the preparation and consumption of homemade food is testament to this fact. Furthermore, rituals such as drinking tea with mates after eating the pork ribs (as in BKT) creates time for socialising and strengthening bonds with mates.

MC decides to set up a ramen teh shop in Singapore. This runs in parallel to MC settling in Singapore. It is not known what time frame this occurs in. We are shown a family portrait of MC with his maternal relatives as well as Kota with his elderly caregivers. (Remember, MC and Kota is the one true ship here!) This could mean that MC has decided that his future remains with what's left of his (maternal) family - in Singapore. It could also mean that MC wants to hone his ramen teh craft in Singapore before he brings it back to Takasaki.

The final scene of the movie shows MC's parents sharing a BKT meal when they are still dating. This is then juxtaposed with food blogger stepping into MC's ramen teh restaurant. (Another reminder that MC and Kota is the one true ship of the movie.)


**Post**
Overall, the movie is about how mixing different ingredients together can lead to resentment and fighting. The fighting occurs when individuals want to protect their beliefs and when they want to change the beliefs of others. We are also shown how food can help people communicate and reconcile their differences. MC resolves his hang-ups with his maternal grandmother the only way he knows: by preparing food for her. By finding food delicious, MC also strengthens his connection with his maternal family - so much so that he remains in Singapore by the end of the movie. 

The movie also raises the idea that bad things happen to good people - at least this is what MC thinks halfway through the movie. In his eyes, his mother did everything correctly, but she was the one who suffered the most misgivings, even until she died. This line of thinking leads to MC's drunken tirade toward his grandmother.

I could only pick out three soundtracks throughout the whole movie. The two other tunes apart from the theme song were gentle and delicate. They did not evoke strong emotions by themselves, but I felt they were adequate accompanying tunes for the storytelling.

A few qualms I had about the storytelling are as follows:
1) Why is MC's memory of his mother only through the preparation and consumption of food? She is not shown conversing with him in Japanese in these memories. Bear in mind she was part of MC's life from his birth to the age of 10, when she passed away. Surely they would have had proper conversations in Japanese worth remembering throughout that period.

2) We see MC consuming BKT in what I assume is a Singaporean BKT restaurant. This leads me to believe that MC has spent a significant period of time in Singapore. It annoys me that MC could be born in Singapore and not learn Chinese, which would be his mother tongue. That he does not use google to attempt to translate his mother's diary is frustrating. 'Current day' is assumed to be 2017 after all. 

3) Why did MC forsake Kota? This was the one true ship!

4) Based on the tidbits dropped throughout the film, we can assume that the timeline between when MC's parents first met and the 'current day' spans the 1980s to 2017. Why then, do the MRTs look so similar between the sequence leading up to 1980s flashback scenes and the sequence for the 'current day'?^At least show a sequence where the train doesn't move mah.^jk  

5) I am a little confused about the sequence of events. I have the notion that MC's parents moved to Japan to get married and live for a while after the fallout with MC's grandmother. Where else would the scenes of MC's mother drinking tea and moping be shot? However, we also have scenes of a relatively grown up (child) MC eating BKT in what has to be Singapore. Then, we are told that MC's mother only started writing in the diary when she knew she would pass away (the timeline for this is 6 months). Yet, we are shown scenes of her doodling in the diary in a location with sakura. After her death, MC refuses to leave with his luggage from a location (which I assume is Singapore?) before finally succumbing to his father's wishes. I guess it is also possible that MC's mother returned to Singapore the final month to attempt to meet her mother and make up, but this was not to be.

I can accept that this family flip-flopped between Japan and Singapore, but the reason for the shared screen time in both countries confounds me, at least for storytelling reasons.

6) Just want to reiterate that if MC and his mom actually communicated with words when they were together, there wouldn't be a need for a diary.


So, in terms of rewatchability, I think the historical and cultural tidbits had adequate payoffs at the end of the movie. I would only rewatch this movie to invoke certain feelings. Rewatches would only occur between years, i reck",dreadiplomat110,drown to death

In short I was in a horrible place in my head and when I boarded the cab I was already crying (not the kind that you can discreetly hide lol I was outright sobbing already). Instead of probing he gave me a pack of tissues then we started talking about why I was crying.

At the end of my trip I realised they don't take card or NETS so I said I will get his number and make a bank transfer in the next 10 minutes since I don't usually carry cash around. This is my fault because I should've asked if he took card/NETS as payment before I boarded. However the driver uncle told me he will waive the fee and even offered to drive over to the coffee shop 5 mins away to get me a cold drink.

I couldn't accept his offer (and started crying more bc I didn't expect such kindness after a really shitty week) and gave him all the cash I had, which didn't even amount to half the trip fee. I'm glad he accepted it and I'm glad I met + spoke to him.

I still hate myself for not getting his name and car plate number so I can make a formal compliment to the cab company.

Before I left he said, life is always about balance and ups and downs, see girl, you had such a bad week but now you meet me and i'm good!

A little bit of backstory, I graduated from Nitec with a GPA of 3.7 and decided to apply for poly straight from nitec (BAD CHOICE) in a course that I thought I was interested in. Turns out I havent done enough research. I've always been a hands-on learner, always been a very slow learner when it comes to theory so being in ITE really benefit and taught me a lot. Sometimes I do force myself to sit down and study, even watch video lecture that poly provides so you learn at home. For some reason I just dont have the ability to do that, half way while watching the video lecture and I'll start daydreaming even at home. Some goes when I'm in a lecture in school, my attention span is really really shot. I do force myself and try not to daydream or stare into blank space but it seems like something that is wired into my DNA and few seconds later I'll be back in dreamland. This short attention span of mine was already a thing back in secondary school where teachers would scold me for daydreaming in class hahaha.


The problem I have right now is, I realised that I've completely given up on poly. I dont have the drive to study, nothing motivates me to keep on going. Results are getting worse each time and this course is heavy on theory that I cant even keep up anymore. I have asked my lecturers for 1 on 1 session with them, it helped a bit with catching up with classes I guess..  Now that exams are around the corner, I dont feel motivated to study and I just generally feel like I've already given up. Which is why I have chosen to drop out of poly if I ever fail this exam as I hate take the idea of having to remodule the modules I'm currently taking.


My original backup plan is to drop out of poly and server my NS, after that I would probably get a full time job while doing part time diploma in a course that I'm interested in. I have a friend that is currently on this path, but studying part time in ITE instead. What should I do? To those who have dropped out from poly and went on this path, what are you doing right now? Do you regret your decisions? Having to deal with this everyday is killing me very slow",bloodandroses,I hate myself
From Crippling Shyness to Outgoing Chatterbox: A Cat's Take,92,6ekkep,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6ekkep/from_crippling_shyness_to_outgoing_chatterbox_a/,33,2017-06-01 20:52:52,"#Preamble

So, I've been seeing quite a few redditors here saying that they're introverted or shy and feel they're doomed to a life of loneliness, and at the same time there've also been a few people curious about me, so I've been thinking about doing this post for some time, and here it is!

#Shy? ""Introverted""?

For those of you who think that it's hard to talk to people for whatever reason, please understand that it's not PERMANENT — behaviours can be changed and you don't always have to be this way. In fact I really hate the introvert/extrovert angle: Introversion/extroversion as most people understand it is not really anchored in any serious psychology study that I've read, and it's really a more complex thing than a simple continuum, never mind a hard a/b classification. Not to mention that introverts aren't necessarily social recluses either. 

As for me... let's start from the beginning.

#An incredibly shy kid who got better

Most babies at around the age of one year are able to say simple words like ""mama"" or ""dada""; I didn't. It took me until the age of three before I said a word, and that word was ""car"". My parents were so worried before that moment that they visited doctors multiple times to see if there was something wrong with me.

That reluctance to speak carried on till I was in primary school. I had no friends, spoke to no classmates at all, and only very reluctantly spoke to teachers when called upon. During recess I either sat in the classroom reading (I was one hell of a reader as a kid) until class resumed, or I'd sit on the benches in the canteen watching others play. I didn't buy anything to eat because that'd mean talking to the stall operators, and who has the guts for that?

Things got a bit better as I got into upper primary and made a few friends, but even then I only made a few friends for the bare minimum of a social support network and that was about it.

#The game-changers

The first big change happened during... well, you guessed it: National Service. Unlike many others, circumstances meant that I ended up in a unit that was largely geared towards reservist administration and training. For me, I had to learn to interact with a fair number of people every few weeks, and made sure that I communicated and instructed the reservists clearly. Another big influence was being around people who weren't in or affected by the narrow tunnel view that someone who was stuck in 12 years of the Singapore education system; basically, these people had the street smarts I didn't have, and I learnt very quickly from them. Looking back I think that was a big change, as it primed myself to adapt to the other changes that lay ahead. 

After NS came university; as some of you may know, I entered SMU, where every module had a group presentation, and your participation in class was also graded. The time during then helped me to focus on having a louder voice (I still don't like using it very much though), as well as granted the posture and body language needed for a successful presentation.

A few other things happened more recently that greatly added to the foundations: I helped someone I knew in a retail place that was known for its customer service, and I also did some volunteer work in my spare time. Both these experiences taught me what being sincere and positive can do to help people, and that small gestures can go a long way in touching people's lives. Speaking of being positive...

#Positivity

A few have remarked how positive I am. As mentioned, working in a positive retail environment really helped me shape my perception, as well as doing volunteering work, but what's also important is that ultimately, I've always been an idealist at heart. I've always believed in doing the ""right thing"", whatever that is. It may have come from reading too much; too much of what, I can't remember! Maybe it's all the children's books about young heroes and heroines?

It's not like I've always been this way though; I've been cynical and downcast at times (especially during that teen and young adult phase), but with age I've come to realise that I'd really rather look on the bright side than thinking the worst of everything and everyone. Life is simply too short to remain unhappy for long.

Another factor is that I've been in a pretty well-off environment; I've had loving parents despite our fair share of disputes and fights, and we've never had to worry about where the next meal is coming from. While I wouldn't say I'm rich (still can't afford a HDB flat on my own, loan or no), not being stuck in a fight for basic survival probably helps.

#So, to end...

Well, sorry to say if this didn't contain any miracle advice; if you were expecting shortcuts, there really are none to be found, and that's what life is most of the time. It is a lot of experience and hard work. The theme as you may have realised is that it took me a while to go from A to B; what I hope you take away from this is that nothing is truly permanent as long as you want to change, and that change has to be fought for — most of the rapid changes I've gone through came from being tossed in the deep end and me butting with the edges of my comfort zone. If you're thinking that you want to change, don't take as long as I did. Start today!

I still hope that you all found this useful. Take care you a",HidingCat,I hate myself

How can an eccentric person find a life in Singapore?,9,4lls18,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4lls18/how_can_an_eccentric_person_find_a_life_in/,64,2016-05-30 11:16:05,"EDIT:

Thanks everyone for the responses! I need to clarify a few things:

I should be using the term ""Asperger syndrome"" (AS) as that's what the doctor diagnosed me with (and I conveniently forgot, thanks to some replies below who actually managed to identify it), rather than eccentric. The main points are the same though:

- AS is a mild form of autism, where the main shortcoming is a deficit in my set of social skills. (But ""mild"" means I'm still mostly normal.) I thank the replies below for making me confident that this is something I can overcome personally and I only have myself to blame if it remains an issue later on in life.

- AS also means that my way of thinking differs fundamentally from that of ""normal"" people. In particular, it does not mean I am straight-up more disabled than ""normal"" people, it just means I have my own strengths and weaknesses like everyone else.

What I'm worried about is how both *bosses/employers* and *people I meet in everyday life* will perceive and treat me here in Singapore, given that I think in a fundamentally different way than them. What kind of responses can I expect from these people, and how should I deal with them?

I'm not going to pretend to be normal (all the time) except as a last resort, because:

- I'll be giving up my own identity: my potential strengths, my real interests, my happiness.

- If I'm going to pretend to be something I'm not, I will most definitely be of lower quality than the real deal, i.e. everyone else.

I was also wondering if moving to a Western country is a good idea, since their society is more open-minded... I speculate anyway. :I

Side point: The MO actually gave me an option to PES F because of AS, and also because I'm having a severe period of depression and anxiety here in NS. (I'm currently PES E1L9.) My counsellors say PES F isn't that world-ending (the IT industry which I'm planning to enter has nearly nothing to do with a military lifestyle, and MNCs don't even care about NS, employers will love my lack of reservist etc.), but my parents say PES F will absolutely ruin my life (the indication of my character, the potential danger to the company etc.). I believe my counsellors since they're more experienced, but my parents are really adamant about staying on. I really need something concrete, so can someone give some good arguments about whether or not to PES F? Or even better, provide the names of some employers in the IT industry so that I can actually contact them to check their stand on the matter? (It's the most surefire way to confirm the extent to which PES F will affect my life at this point. I tried sourcing for typical employers but Google isn't helping, it only offered IDA.) Many thanks to anyone who can help me on this!

old post:

(My first post on reddit.)

The short question: Being an eccentric person, what kind of advice would you give to me in order to lead a better life in a conservatist society like Singapore's?

The long:
I'm a soon-to-be 20 year old Singaporean Chinese boy, currently serving NS. I've known myself as an eccentric person since sec school and I'm pretty happy about myself... if my life isn't being affected by other people so much.

(I seem to fit the bill for eccentricity snugly according to Wikipedia.)
About my eccentricity: I get my own weird ideas very often, and my mind wanders a lot, making me happy when I think of crazy, epic things. (Apparently I smile and talk to myself a lot.) ""Normal""/""age-suited"" topics and interests (such as sports, politics, popular video games, trending stuff like iPhones, and pop music) are pretty boring to me / I just can't get into with them. Socially, I can't make sense of the expectations and judgments people have sometimes, in a society that expects that to be second nature. I also have little social awareness for my age (e.g. I'm unable to read other people's moods and intentions, and have little sense of what is polite or respectful).

I'm starting to worry about the social ramifications of my eccentricity and social blindness in a society like Singapore's, where you are greatly expected to know and conform to the social norms. There are two main repercussions:
- I feel lonely from having no one else to share ideas and interests with me. It also means that my ideas aren't supported by anyone else. I can talk generally and about things I know, but I have no real BFF to be crazy with.
- More practically, it may be difficult for me to get a job here since soft skills are so emphasised these days. Even if I were to get one, it will be hard for me to advance to a higher, more managerial position (where the better pay, power and freedom is) since I can't even connect well with other people, much less manage them.

I don't really hate people (unless they have really wronged me, then the hate is real), and I can maintain talking terms but I just don't connect well with people on the personal side. I just prefer to be left alone to pursue my own projects. (I did fairly well in school and hoping to continue doing so in uni and in my future job, so no worries for now.)

I don't think changing myself is a good option, just like school where there are simply some subjects that you cannot do well in no matter how hard you try. Even if I somehow manage to adapt to be able to comprehend the complexities of social relationships, the time for establishing a base of real friends is quite over already. So I wonder what kind of options I can take to make life easier: some kind of social help community, a job that's more friendly to my personality, or even just gtfo of this country and find a better life with some other society.

I'll welcome any help you can give. I can provide more details about myself if need ",savremontjr,I hate myself
My Personal Experience With Patriotism And Nationalistic Pride,9,3p8fbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3p8fbx/my_personal_experience_with_patriotism_and/,15,2015-10-19 07:10:35,"Hey there, just wanna hear the opinions of the Reddiporeans out there.
Is patriotism important to you? 

I have been a mainland Singaporean Citizen for 14 years, (Yes, I'm 14 years old, judge me) and I haven't been feeling the sense of pride I used to have for my own country. I started thinking about where did this pride even came from, why do I think my own country is better than other ones, is it because I was born here? Was I taught to embrace my own country? Was it just my peers, teachers and family just influencing me bit by bit? 
This contemplating started during the death of our first Prime Minister, the general population and my entire school mourned this tragedy. I however, felt extremely cynical and indifferent towards it, though I meant no disrespect, I just felt that there was no point in making such a big deal over an old man's death. Obviously, this wasn't received well towards my peers and teachers, who just dismissed my points as being disrespectful towards the old man and the country itself. This was then shown again when during the NDP, they had reserved a seat for the deceased Prime Minister, and I just sighed at the sentiment. This was yet reinforced when during the General Election, (disclaimer: I hate and do not care for Singapore politics) my parents had kept ranting about how the PAP was using the old man's death to make voters sympathize with them (my parents are WP supporters, because you know, middle class workers). At this point I was starting to doubt my own country.

Another incident was when during a CCE class (Character and Citizenship Education), the teachers were discussing about the importance of National Service. I myself disagree with National Service, the idea of forcing me and the entire country's worth of males raise arms were chilling, yes I know that we need National Service to defend ourselves in time of need, but me being a naive small minded 14 year old could not see the prospect of a war against us happening. So when I raised this point up to my teacher, my teacher just said that I needed to serve in order to protect my loved ones and the people I care about before making me sit down. To be honest, the only reason that I disagree with National Service is that it will hinder me from achieving my vocational desires. Then I think again, isn't economic defense a thing? If I want to achieve my dream job, won't this job help contribute to our economy in this great chain of industry? I also shivered at the fact that if I were to attempt to run away or move to another country, I would be considered as a treasonous criminal and also the fact that I would have to carry out re-service after re-service even during my job.

The last straw was that I simply couldn't love a country that betrayed my social and philosophical beliefs. Being a left-wing liberal hippie living in a country run by a conservative right-wing government that silences free speech and the media, bans gay marriage, and bans a documentary film about communist exiles because it ""undermined national security"" despite the fact that no single Singaporean will never fall to the impossible and utopic ideals of Communism (by the way the documentary is really good, watch it here ""http://www.tosingaporewithlove.com"") makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. In fact when I had went to annual ""Pink Dot"" festival, one of my classmates (he's Christian and fanatically patriotic) had accused me of being a gay and heretic, to which I gave a middle finger and walked away (excuse me for being immature but I was extremely mad at that time). By this point of realization, I had completely lost all sense of pride for my own country, and this feeling was completely new and felt strange. I had complete resentment over MY own country and I felt that the brainwashing that has been built up had literally been washed away. Is it bad to no longer have any patriotism and nationalistic pride towards your own motherland?

And as a Muslims too, can't we have that mentality of the prophet to have endurance and strife to learn even when Prophet Mohamed is illierate? 

I know this is the wrong place to convey my message because I'm sure there are many of us Malays here who are better than what I mentioned.. but this is something we need to look into for our children or as mentors remind the Malay children do better than what we already are.

> The death of singer Kim Jong Hyun saw local fans organise an event for public mourning ([A black and white memorial for SHINee's Jonghyun by Singaporean fans at Hong Lim Park; ST Online, Dec 20](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/a-black-and-white-memorial-for-shinees-jonghyun-by-singaporean-fans-at-hong)).
 
> Sympathy, tears, shock and disbelief were just some of the reactions. But all things considered, should we be surprised when such a suicide occurs?
 
> Kim was a star. He seemingly had it all - fame, fortune and success.
> 
> But let's take a closer look at what else we know about him.

---
> • He was male. And when it comes to suicide, gender differences abound. Since 2010, the ratio of male to female suicide deaths in Singapore has been approximately two to one. Nationally, more males than females die by suicide every year. This is in line with the trend for many developed countries.  
> 
> Interestingly, it is believed that significantly more women than men attempt suicide. This is known as the gender paradox in suicide.

---
> • He was 27. Among young people aged 15 to 29, suicide is the second leading cause of death globally, after road traffic injuries. In Singapore, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people in the same age band.

 --- 
> • He was struggling with his mental health. It was reported that Kim confessed to ""depressive feelings"" his entire life in an earlier magazine interview. A note he left a confidant also surfaced his feelings of hopelessness and despair. 

> Mental health and suicide are closely related. Those grappling with mental health are at greater risk of suicide than the general population. How many people truly understand the sadness and feelings of depression that overwhelm a person? Depression can be devastating and requires support from professionals, family and the community.

--- 
> • He was in a high-pressure environment. In his line of business, there is overwhelming pressure to succeed, with celebrities having to account to their label, fans and team mates. At the same time, criticism and feedback are swift and unforgiving.

--- 
> Kim's death is the most recent in a year that saw several high-profile celebrity suicides, including those of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington.
> 
> But he could have been anyone who experienced emotional turmoil with suicidal thoughts which ended tragically in death.
> 
> Suicide can and must be prevented. It is a public health concern which claims individuals from all walks of life, ages and cultures.
> 
> Suicide prevention is everyone's business. We need to talk about suicide - and not just when celebrities suffer.

> 
> Given that Singapore is a relatively stressful society, it is easy to brush off the stress students feel as something that everyone faces during his schooling years.
> 
> While stress is inevitable and some stress will motivate us to work harder, it is also important to note that too much stress can be potentially harmful, not just to our physical health, but also to our mental health.
> 
> Currently, there appears to be very little awareness of mental health in schools.
> 
> Mental health education should be emphasised in our education, just like how sex education is.

Definitely trying out all of these (including the funeral one if shit gets bad) at least once, thanks r/singapore!! 

It's driving me nuts. I'm not even married, I'm barely out of uni, but everyone over the age of 40 thinks they can shove the kids question in my face. Boyfriend's mom is major culprit, mom is major culprit, BOSS is major culprit. I grin and bear it or make jokes, but it's driving me up the wall because every time I even suggest I might not want kids they think they can lecture me about how I'm dumb and how much I'll regret it when I'm old and dying. I have lived my entire life as a model student, I contribute to my household financially, and I have a long term boyfriend who is also a cookie cutter good kid. Somehow I still deserve to be put down on an almost daily basis and told that I'm not doing my job as a citizen and child.

Financially and health wise both I am not doing very well now, I lost money in investment and only have less than 10k net worth under my name. Health wise, due to long term smoking, I have been experiencing bad cough and breathlessness. But, yesterday is the final straw.

Long story short, I had food poisoning yesterday night and I had no one beside me to accompany me to the clinic /A&E. So  I had to drag my sick body to the clinic myself, limping on my way to it.

I lived with my brother and when I called him for help, he said he is busy and ask me to go clinic myself.. I do have a few friends but it didn't even come across my mind to call them for help....

So I had a sudden realisation that I ONLY have MYSELF to rely on. There is this chinese saying,  锦上添花易 雪中送炭难 ( Not worth mentioning the icing on the cake, but for help in the snow ). When you are doing well, you will suddenly have a lot of friends around you, coming to congratulate you and leech off from you. When you're in deep shit, you are alone, only a few true friends or relative who will really help you selflessly, without asking for anything in return.

Honestly does anyone feel that Singpass has an extremely inefficient system with Incompetent staff?,14,963ref,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/963ref/honestly_does_anyone_feel_that_singpass_has_an/,16,2018-08-10 20:21:22,"I know that a lot of measures are taken for security purposes but holy fk I’m so sick of dealing with this shit all the time 

Firstly the policy of having you change your password every year is alr a complete chore, esp when you take the time to remember the password in the end of the day it all fking for nothing

Secondly comes the updating of information in Singpass, you basically have to update your information online whether it be your password/username phone number etc etc
I honestly don’t understand why a we have A 2FA system when you can’t even use the information when we can’t even use our information there to verify ourselves. Instead we have to wait for a pin mailer in which they “promise” to get it sent in 5 working days, you either use that online method of updating your information or you go to a cc and get it done almost immediately. 

You might be thinking “is that all?” But no here’s what even worse, with my history of dealing with Singpass them saying that they would deliver the pin mailer in 5 working days is a complete lie cause it never ever happens. The first time I forgot my password so I had to reset it, it took 18 working days for it to come but I wasn’t in much of a hurry, the second time however it was even worse, after 20 working days I could not wait any longer as I had to use the eservices urgently, I had to rush down to Kallang CC just to do my compulsory yearly password reset. When I got there I told the person attending to me about my situation and he said that this was a “very common situation”. when he said that I was in complete shock, is this how Singpass have been handling their services all these while? So basically to them promises mean nothing ? I even called the Singpass office to enquire on my pin mailer and he actually told me they hadn’t even sent it out yet and if my situation was really urgent I could go to the cc myself. What is this ? Are they just giving us the middle finger and telling us singaporeans to do every thing ourselves now ? I think they don’t understand how they are possibly affecting our lives, I have to work and study as well, I DONT HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME TO GO WHERE I PLEASE. 

2 months later and here we are and Guess what I am denied access again because I changed my number . I can’t even access my own medical records that I do urgently need and apparently I have to wait for the pin mailer that I know won’t come in 5 working days. And to TOP it of not all CCs have Singpass service so I have to travel all the way to Kallang for it. Idk man I’m so sick of this and Singpass is adding on unnecessary stress to my life , has anyone ever gone through this same shit as wel",Nayuta_kani_,life is shit
MLM,56,8pry5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8pry5c/mlm/,43,2018-06-10 02:30:00,"Anyone kena by a friend to join elusyf before? U know... the company that psycho u to spend 3k or 9k on the spot. Did u manage to get out? Thank fuck i manage to.

Basically they sell health products to:

1) Their own distributors (99% of the money u earn comes from selling products to your friend to “try” so that they can be more credible when trying to sell it to actual customers. It’s almost impossible to sell to actual customers so the friend which got “conned” gets another friend to sign up and psycho him saying “oh my I earned big bucks doing this” and get him to try the products by buying and earns commision off of that, cycle repeats)

2) Actual customers (1% of money)

Looooong story time: So one fine day out of nowhere, a friend of mine whom I nvr met for a few months called me and told me that her friend owns a business opportunity for me to make “big money” and that I wouldn’t have to work under others. 

The reason why she looked for me was because the last time I met her at work, we chatted about what we were going to do in the future and what we wanted and didnt, which I shared that I wanted to be an entrepreneur and not drag myself to work 9-5 monday to friday.

Turns out she was under this mlm company called “elusyf” for quite some time while working part time at where I worked. So she hit me up and asked me to meet her and her friend (supposedly the ‘owner’) at some ulu place in Ubi. They brought me into the office, slowly showig all the achievement, holidays they went for because of what they did.

So after all that bullshit, they sat me down on a round table and my friend just sat there like a statue while the boss got someone to talk (or rather psycho) me into putting my hopes up to earn some good money whilst doing very little. How that works is by selling their magical hippie ass healthcare products to people who need them, such people with skin condition which they claim to work because of some “stem cell” treatment etc etc and even have celebrities endorse it (which they obviously paid them to la fuck u think they really try meh).

I wasn’t really interested and I heard of MLMs before so I didnt really gave 2 fucks about what they were blabbering about which they could obviously see from my face. So they decided to pump in more bullshit to try to convince me that it works. One of which I fucking swear was the most ridiculous. “Oh my friend didn’t have her period for 4 years and after taking this for 2 mths, she started menstruating again” Like come the fuck on as if 1 year wasn’t enough for u to suspect yourself of having ovarian cancer or some shit and getting yourself checked

Moving on, my friend started about her dreams and goals (make big money, bring her parents for holidays, travel the world etc etc). All of which were probably taught in their brainwashing, oh i mean... “training” sessions. They even went on to say stuff like “let your parents enjoy the life they deserve and not let them wait too long” which basically means join us or your parents will die before u can even let them enjoy.

They offered packages which I’m supposed to try for myself to see that it works so that i have a “testimonial” to prove so that i would be able to sell more easily but in actual fact the packages sold as “testimonials” was the way my friend was making money. Was told that it would take 1 year to take effect, and was guaranteed it would work, bullshit confirmed. That’s when I knew my “friend” was trying to earn commission off of me through sales in that way rather than selling to actual consumers. THAT’S HOW MOST OF THEIR MONEY COME IN ANYWAY. A small percentage from actual customers. They had 2 packages, the $3000 and $9000, obviously the $9000 being cheaper per box. Since I kinda expected that to happen, I said I don’t have money which they then told me they offered $950 package too. And again, told them I don’t have money which they then became smart and asked me how much I have. I threw in a random amount, $500, which they then offered me 1 box of their product at $450

Since the whole brainwashing thing took almost 4 hours, my mind slipped for the concept of the “just get the customers here and our consultants will take care of the rest - meaning brainwash”. I gave in to the pressure because they wouldnt fucking let me leave. So i withdrew the $450 and mind u my friend escorted me to the atm which was quite a walk away and waites as I did it. After I passed the cash to her and filled up my details. I left the building with a fake hhahahah goodbye.

On the way home was when i realised i fucked up and what i did. So immediately I called my friend to ask for a refund, which worked as I went down to the same place again, which i got psychoed again for the last time which i didnt give in to this time. They told me to collect the cheque a few weeks later which I did.

TL:DR: Friend got me to sign up for MLM which i nvr thought i would fall for since i read about it, but did anyway. They earn their money through selling to customers (small % comes from here) and their own people (distributors) to try it for themselves to “see that it actually works” <————-MOST OF THE MONEY COMES FROM this

Observations by Singaporean(s) at Oxford,235,8aoby6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8aoby6/observations_by_singaporeans_at_oxford/,34,2018-04-08 22:38:17,"#Oxfess16614

The Ultimate Encyclopaedia of Singaporean Students at Oxford

1. The Triple Threat: Chinese, Christian, Government Scholarship holder. Ultra-anglicized scions of the colonial bureaucracy. Grew up in Bukit Timah with multiple generations of family members having attended mission schools before heading to the Raffles or Anglo-Chinese School finishing schools. Knows more Latin than local dialect. Highly familiar with western classical music and literature. Quickly learns upon arrival that you don’t make friends with contemporary Brits by dropping Jane Eyre references and quickly masters Zadie Smith and trap. Learns to distinguish the right kind of woke (environmental charities and effective altruism) from the wrong kind (Rhodes Must Fall) and shuts up about the latter while running to be the face of diversity initiatives. Typically the only students of Asian ethnicity involved in incredibly white shit like choir (not rowing, because these types are either very skinny or quite fat). Graduates from Oxford with a solid First, and returns to rise quickly in a government that gives them extraordinary latitude to impose their versions of Plato’s Republic on the socially-housed denizens of Singapore. No qualms because deep down inside, they know they are born to rule.

2. The Trapped Intellectual: ultra-brainy middle-class kid who couldn’t have afforded Oxford if not for a civil-service scholarship. Really should have studied locally and then gone straight for a PhD. Probably the most brilliant student in JC and definitely took Knowledge and Inquiry (KI) as an A level subject. Realises upon arrival at Oxford that it is hardly an intellectual nirvana at the undergraduate level and starts to regret the decision. A true, dyed in wool liberal, a soul fitted for the life of the mind but forced into government. Frustrated intellectual ambitions will be coped with by writing copious amounts of poetry - some of which will turn out to be quite good - while a middling civil servant, thus fulfilling to a tee the archetype of the Tang Dynasty Bureaucrat-Poet.

3. The Scientist: Schooled all the way through in Hwa Chong, RVHS, Dunman. Almost always middle class, but once in a blue moon you get someone descended from a rubber/tin/finance/real estate billionaire clan. Partially conversant in the Confucian Classics and semi-competitive in games like Chess and Go. Can always be relied on last minute to play Dota but still hands in problem sets on time. Unfailingly turns up CNY event for cheap and good food. Probably bought few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin in 2015. Will go on to do a PhD in the sciences, and have lots well-remunerated and intellectually fulfilling career options. Aside from the occasional sexist remark about women in STEM, there's really not much else you can hold against them. Attributes their high-functioning, well-adjusted nature to the strong cultivating aspects of their classic education, grounded in 5,000 years of Chinese Wisdom which they, as true heirs to the Chinese Civilisation, helped safeguard from Evil Communists.

4. ​The Hipster Undergrad: Usually female. Excited to come to do History, Literature or Geography, but shit goes downhill after not getting into anything for Spring Week. Takes good photos in Eastern Europe though. If finds a rich white person to marry during undergrad, will go on to work in a media job in London. If that fails, heads to America on Daddy’s coin to do a masters’ degree in another hipster subject, writes sad research paper coining terms like ""Decolonial Aesthesis” to rationalise failed attempts to assimilate into British High Culture.

5. The Careerist: Law, E&M or PPE (without scholarship). Strong minority. Came here because they knew exactly what they wanted to do - which is that they had no idea what they actually wanted to do aside from getting into the most prestigious internships/universities/jobs possible. Makes CNY and Formal Dinners tedious once critical mass of them exceeds a certain proportion.

6. The Philosopher King: Related by blood to Lee Kuan Yew, and living embodiment of the triumvirate of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Becomes Best Speaker In the World while winning the Gibbs Prize easily, and tops the MPhil in Economics while supported by a Clarendon. Gets into Harvard and then pursues research in Mechanism Design, the hardest, truest and purest branch of microeconomic theory. Tries not to be involved in family feuds but has to step in when the Democracy of the Republic is at stake.

7. The Debater: PPEist has always aspired to be 6 but with mixed success due to lack of 166 IQ royal blood.

8. The FOB Postgrad: Spends way too long being initially over-awed by Oxford and taking embarrassing pictures. Glad they finally made it to this hallowed institution of Singaporean elite culture, but a bit insecure that they didn’t do so for undergrad. However, their confidence grows from strength to strength as they start make contributions to the sum of human knowledge and learn how to use the Manual setting on the DSLR.

9. The Aesthete Postgrad: Doing a DPhil in History, Literature or Oriental Studies. Plays multiple instruments, some of them very obscure. Comes to Oxford already skilled in hipstercraft such as film photography, bicycle repair and tea brewing, even though literally no one does this back home. Generally liked by everyone, but quite reclusive. Underestimated how Conservative the humanities and social sciences departments at Oxford are, and sometimes fantasise about having gone to Cambridge or SOAS instead. Marries a native brit to secure residence while pursuing their low-income, dead-end careers. Happiness and overall sense of well-being and life progress in their 20s bought from wilful ignorance of how brutal the academic job markets in their fields actually are.

10. ​The International School Kid: hello

My friend linked me to this twitter chain the other day. 

https://twitter.com/jemmawei/status/836401122663227392

TLDR, ""boys crying about NS is a tool to shut down the conversation about male privilege in Singapore and is only one example of unfairness towards men, while women are disadvantaged in all other areas"" 

This came to mind because of a comment I saw today complaining about the ""BUT NS"" mentality on /r/Singapore. 

Newsflash. NS isn't a singular moment of oppression. It isn't yes all women have felt harassed by perverts on the MRT, it is literally enshrined in law that all men in Singapore, barring severe mental/physical incapability be subject to two years of involuntary servitude with limited compensation. 

I'd like to point out that even if all you did for NS was sit in an air conditioned office 8-5 with the best superiors, it's still a shit deal that nobody would voluntarily subject themselves to. 

That's not even dealing with the social consequences, the attitudes of people towards NSFs, chao recruits, the way many of your female friends move on with their lives. 

If you sat down and really thought about it, it's an inescapable aspect of life for men in Singapore, and an extremely unpleasant experience that takes up a significant time of your adult life if you're a young adult in your 20s (aka most of /r/sg, well that and teenagers/kids).  

Why does this come up in gender conversations all the time? Because it's relevant. Because it's 2 years of your life, not a hypothetical mind you, but an actual reality, gone because of your gender. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/71w2gu/mindsets_need_to_change_to_bridge_gender_pay_gap/

You get studies like that showing that women get paid less than men in Singapore. For different work. How do I know? Because they didn't count NSFs of course. Why not? I guess NSFs don't have income because they aren't workers, they're slaves. 

BUT NS!!! is only problematic if you're trying to push a narrative of privilege. The argument that men's rights don't matter because men are privileged is all too common from certain nutjob organizations though, and it is these organizations/individuals that seem to have the biggest problem with ""BUT NS"" because it flips their narrative of privilege on its head. 

Does privilege exist? Of course! But privilege doesn't cut one way. It's not a stick you should use to beat on other people and say I am oppressed and you are not. NS doesn't mean women are more privileged than men in society and women should shut up about women's issues. 

I've been told to check my Chinese privilege. I was born in Malaysia, a country that's openly racist against Chinese people, and we live in a region where Chinese are the minority. Should I therefore ask people to check their regional Malay privilege? 

Sexism, Racism and any sort of ism isn't black or white. Stop using those things to shut down conversations. Play fair. Play nice. It's probably too much to ask for but we can hop",Fat_unker,life is shit
H1B1 Visa AMA,29,7nflav,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7nflav/h1b1_visa_ama/,34,2018-01-02 07:19:58,"Hello. I noticed [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5rf594/h1b1_visa/) and realized theres not much content on here relating to the h1b1. I have done it 2 times and am about to get my 3rd. I am not a lawyer, I'm just a fellow Singaporean who has had a few jobs in the US. So I may not have all the answers but just wanted to put up a post in case pple have questions on the process and maybe others who know more can chip in.

some prior art:

- [This quora post](https://christinang89.quora.com/5-steps-to-file-for-H-1B1-Singapore-Visa-yourself)
- [This blog post](http://blog.hguochen.com/guide/2014/11/22/My-H1B1-experience/)

are the only two ""regular human"" resources i have found online. would be glad to learn more.

some things that have mattered to me:

- yes i have a masters and bachelor's from the US. cant speak to any other educational background
- my first time i was with a big company which hired a big law firm to do things for me. my other two times were very much ""DIY"".
- i worked in a 20 person, 2 yr old startup in the US and they got an LCA for me while I got a lawyer for about 2.5k through upwork which i paid for. it is a myth that you need to be an established company to sponsor a h1b1.
- if you are working with a big firm that outsources this stuff to a law company they typically have you prepare a whooole bunch of supporting documents to have in original and duplicate before you show up to the embassy. this is of course nice to have but i have never once needed it in an interview. so it really is not the end of the world if you dont have it
- yes you really have to go to a SingPost SAM machine and pay the us$190. its sketchy as hell. 
- choosing the supposedly faster ""drop box"" option delayed my processing by a week because they rejected me from the drop box without stating a reason and asked me to come in for an interview after.
- schedule those interviews early if you want to leave asap!! availabilities can be two weeks out. and then it takes them a week or so to mail ur passport to the phillipines and then back to you. meanwhile you'll know if its been approved so you can go ahead and firm up your travel dates by then.
- (not strictly h1b1 related) paying US taxes and social security and all that really cuts into the salary. im in new york so theres state and city tax too. the number may look higher than what ur getting elsewhere but the taxes come accordingly.

ok i cant think of anymore. please ask away or DM if this post expires and you cant reply to this post.

please no politics.

EDIT: forgot to mention. once you have your DS160 filled out (it looks intimidating but can be finished in 1-2hrs) then you book your US embassy appointment here: <https://ceac.state.gov/ceac/> This is a fucking old ass website and is an embarrasment to the US government and i would gladly fix it for them for free but unfrotunately thats life. anyway. 

at the bottom of the main booking form they ask u for a Petitioner's name, receipt number, start date and expiration date. this is an oudated field that is no longer in use. fill in whatever u want but for receipt number it ONLY accepts a ""dummy receipt number"" that is ""ABC0000000000"". this is straight up what the support center will say. if you try to fill in what is a COMMON SENSE thing which is the MRV receipt number you will get an error saying ""Petition Receipt Number: Format is incorrect. Please enter the receipt number without dashes (-)"". Which is not even making sense. i fucking lost 4 days to this piece of shit because i forgot what i did last time. i hope this helps someone else because i kena this before and this time around i kena again. mfw.

(btw you only really need the MRV receipt number at the screen after that when you actually book the appointment -
 its the long autogenerated number (starting with 8 at the time of posting) that you get from the PDF that you used to pay at the Singpost SAM kiosk. sketchy as fuck, ug",swyx,life is shit

My IPPT, when i took it in school, was 87 points, as i run/gym very regularly (almost every day, cut down nowadays because of my 'A' levels that're coming up in 24 days), even after my season ended.

I do know that the PES is a measure of my health, not fitness- the NHC doctor told me some complicated stuff about my heart (i didn't understand shit), but he also said it's not a big deal? I was concerned, as i never had any medical condition, so we got these medical reports and sent them to my father's cardiac surgeon, who looked them over and also said that it was a condition that is very common (still don't know what it's called), and isn't a big deal, i.e. isn’t fatal, just a small abnormality.

I'm quite devastated, because i'm somewhat of a fitness buff, and wanted to get into the Commandos/NDU (yeah, foolish, i know). So i was wondering if my NS PES could be a mistak",pussydickens,life is shit

Seen a few people enlisting these past few days and thought this would be interesting. We all know NS is shit, but it has its good moments.

Here's mine, lifted lovingly from my own profile page:

>I'm an SCDF regular serving as a fire rescue specialist. I signed on in poly, so I have to serve 5 years with SCDF before I can be considered as having completed my NS obligations.

>I spent my 6 months in training being ostracised because I'm more a theory kind of person. I also tend to be a bit of a kanchiong spider if I'm doing something I'm not familiar with. Basically, if I'm involved in anything, you can be sure it'll screw up.

>I managed to tahan that and got posted to station. I then spent 1 year+ feeling like an NSF while still doing all the regular admin work, because I had a lot more practice to do to be proficient at the stuff we need to know. At one point, one of the ""nice guys"" archetype firefighter who was more senior told me, ""triface1, don't mess up. I don't want to semula.""

>2 years in, I finally felt like I was a regular and wasn't disturbed as much as the NSFs, especially because the NSFs who have seen me be shit at ops stuff have ORDed. However, I still had an inkling that I'm a bad section commander, because I wasn't confident in my abilities to lead or be the anchor in fire/rescue situations.

>Late 2015, my current (then-new) encik came to our rota and decided one day that during night lecture, we should pass a paper around the table with a name on it, and others had to write their honest, anonymous opinions about this guy.

>I didn't expect anything, because I was kinda in a neutral state at that point already. I was shocked when my paper came back and it was full of comments like: knowledgeable, beautiful soul (I shit you not), willing to share knowledge, etc. There wasn't anything negative on there that affirmed my belief that I was shit at my job.

"Amway, Stay Away",182,5s1vtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5s1vtl/amway_stay_away/,89,2017-02-05 09:41:57,"So I'm trying to sleep but can't because I am seriously disturbed. I went to an Amway meeting earlier today, after someone approached me with a ""business opportunity"". I immediately suspected that something was off, so I came into the meeting skeptical and even secretly took some videos.

They drew a pyramid scheme model during the presentation and tried to argue that it isn't; they talked about income earners as Employees/Self-employed/Business owners/Investora and tried to argue that everyone in Amway is a business owner... the saddest part is that all these uni kids who have been brainwashed into thinking that they're business owners are actually the very employees that they dissed on in their presentation. No, they're worse actually, they're the product.

There were quite a few attendees to the meeting, many of whom were students. One was even a business student... while I'm sure some of them caught on as the seriously dodgy Amway videos were being played, I noticed the majority were already being lured in. After the meeting, there was a chat session with the upline (the person who recruited you), and some of the clueless participants were expressing intense interest. A few more families are gonna be ruined and I really wish I had just shouted out to everyone that it was basically a scam.

I did try to argue with several of the uplines after the meeting was over. It went smth like this:

""How is this not MLM?""
""Do you know what the Singaporean law defines as MLM? If not, you should do your homework and come talk to us again. But basically, MLMs require a large startup cost, but Amway doesn't have that.""
""But in order to join this business, I have to pay a subscribers fee and buy all my household products from Amway instead right?""
""Yes, but the subscribers fee is only $70. Also, you need household products anyway, so it's not a real cost""

After this point, they just kept repeating smth along the lines of ""Ok, I can explain to you in detail, but it will take very long. Why don't you come for the next meeting and we can explain further?""

Also, at the end of the presentation, the presenter stated that we can earn $4000 a month for working from home 10 hours a week. Of course, they didn't state that that's only possible when you have a shit ton of downlines. In fact they framed it in a way like as if that's the starting pay when you join

What really made me sick was when they had a bunch of peopl go up and give testimonies, saying how their ""mentor"" helped so much with their life and transformed them into better people. Three around the words ""integrity"", ""honesty"", etc no less than 30 times. This is probably the closest to Scientology that I will experience in Singapore. It was like Christian Fellowship except the God is money and the Bible are the complete bullshit fluffass books written by the successful Amway ""businessmen"". And instead of trying to do good, they're trying to frame ""scamming your friends and family"" as good.

TL;DR: Witnessed first hand Amway's recruiting tactics. Please be skeptical if anyone ever tells you about a ""business opportunity"". If you hear ""Amway"" or see someone draw you a pyramid diagram, r",cyhlalala,life is shit

Reaching this forkroad, i wanted to go to laselle but when i share this with my friends and FAMILY, they all scolded me and ask me go to local uni instead. I also went to edmw to get second opinions.

Consolidating all the opinions and advises i gotten, this is what i understood
1) Since i took a level, it's easier to get into local uni if i don't screw up.
2) arts have no future and there's a reason why there are success story, because only 0.0001% succeeded
3) local u easier to get good paying jobs and good connection ( my parent say this is impt cuz that was how they met )
4) edmw said, verbatim, ""nus/ntu/smu > unisim / sit / sutd / kaplan > laselle"".
So basically laselle is like the worst of the worst according to edmw.

So, i know it's my life my choice but i still want to get more concrete (*ahem* edmw) second opinions from reddit. I am really more interested in drawing than quantum tunnelling shit. But at the same time, i am uncertain of the future should i choose laselle.

Are Singaporeans really just a bunch of SJWs?

Her personal info was already splashed across the internet. This is insane, what happened to innocent until proven guilty? The law was designed in such a way that the accuser has to prove the crime not the accused. This isn't just an isolated incident. 

Remember what happened to [the Australian man that got fired for calling Singapore 'piece of fucking shit country' for not having Pokémon Go](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/pokemon-go-australian-man-fired-facebook-rant-singapore-a7130931.html). This has literally nothing to do with his company, but the Singaporean mob mentally kicked in and he was fired...

Remember Anthon Casey? My god, that was the worst....He had to fled the country just because he made a crude comment and he was fired from his company even though his comment has nothing to do with the company.

What happened to our world class education? What happened to our moral values? 

Anyway, the point is, why should our company be held responsible for what we did in our personal capacity?

I've met this guy three times, twice while working in a shop in Haji Lane and once in a shop in Beach Road. He doesn't remember having met me before, but a character like that is hard to forget.

He comes in and talks to people and makes these crazy insane guesses and predictions about who you are and really weird obscure facts about your life, and incredibly he *gets them right every time.* He says he's just reading your fortune, and the crazy thing is that his guesses and predictions are so accurate it beggars belief.

He talks about lucky foreheads and his ability to read/calculate what's happening in other people's lives, and somehow predicts things like your age, the month you were born, your partner's age, your 'bad years' (this one came as a shock to me, because the 'bad years' he talked about started exactly the year my sister died). He predicts your chosen days of the week and chosen colours even those days or colours are picked entirely at random or you deliberately choose false information to throw him off the track.

This time I met him I gave him made-up facts about myself to begin with just to test his supposed 'abilities' and put on my best poker face, and even then he managed to give me the *correct* answers at the end. He calls himself Bhupinder Singh, and only gave me the name after I asked him like five times who he was and he insisted he was 'just a holy man' - so who knows if it's his real name to begin with?

The first time I met him 2 years ago I didn't believe what he was saying, but then he said something like ""Next Tuesday you will get a lot of money"" and sure enough on that very day this woman came in and bought a shit ton of stuff from the shop I was working in, totally out of the blue, one of the biggest sales we've ever had. Thursday he shows up and says ""Did I predict correctly?"" And of course he has - who knows if the woman with the sale is related to the lucky forehead reading guy, but all the same wtf?

I know I sound crazy but the things he says are just too damn coincidental. I can't explain it. Has anyone else met this man?

Edit: I don't really care about the 'good luck future' stuff, just in case anyone's wondering. I just wonder how on earth he gets such accurate guesses/predictions even when I'm feeding him false info, and he made a series of 10 predictions that were all correct. It was stuff like 'pick a number between 1-5' and 'choose a flower' and 'your boyfriend's age' (???????) and if you calculate how many permutations of combinations there could be for all those kinds of questions and the chances that *every single answer is on point* it's really an infinitesimally small chan",ItsAZooOutThere,life is shit

I'm choosing based on usefulness of subject in the later working life (plan to do something related to science idk) and maybe how easy the subject is.

As adults/seniors, what insights can you offer in choosing? Is history gonna be of any use next time if I take triple science? Is geography any better off?? Or maybe even not triple science?? Actually, will this shit even matter in JC?

A nine sub combination is suicide though.

As a side note, I prefer hist over geog but I scored 73 for geog and 71 for history.

went to acs. also went to bible camp every june holiday for ten years from the time i was 7. that's when i knew i was trans. also lesbian. stayed in the dang closet cuz i knew i'd have a shit life otherwise. ended up in poly because my chinese was complete crap. f9 baby, woooooo! on the plus side, it was the first intake for temasek poly, so there was no way they were gonna flunk me. sooooo.... i guess it worked out?

took a year off when i was 18 to go backpacking around europe. hit ibiza and stayed for a month. dont remember much, but i know it was fun. tried mdma for the first time.

went into the army. 7bts, ocs, got to rappel out of a helicopter. river crossings were fun, there were crocs, so there were people on rafts with loaded weapons in case of a croc attack. of course the water was muddy as all get out, so if there was a croc, there'd be no time to react.

the tech bubble burst, and bye bye high paying job. i survived by scraping together freelance gigs. my lung collapsed and had to take a year to recover. marriage fell apart and we separated.

got my 2nd dream job as the CTO of a surgery group. started partying again, the money was good. we started advertising at porn expos and partying with the boss at his pad in miami, on his speedboat.

I already bought all the extra items to bring in ( gathered from my seniors who just POP-ed ) to make my life easier. However, all the preparation in the world cannot prepare me for what is about to come, as I have never been to even an adventure camp before in my life, hence all the camping, cooking on the road, outdoors etc etc will be completely new to me. I've also had no experience of being shouted at everyday and having to obey every single rule thrown at me, like it or not, hence I'm afraid I'd have some problems adapting. Is there anything I should know before enlisting? I also have a few questions, any responses will be greatly appreciated.

1. I'm not good at running. Push-ups and sit-ups I can do 50 each in a minute, but my 2.4km timing is 13.24 the last time I took napfa, which is honestly quite embarrassing.  I wish I can say that I trained my ass off to prepare for NS, but unfortunately I've been to less than 5 runs in this whole Nov-Dec period. My question is : Since I wasn't from PTP, will I be expected to run say, 11minutes for 2.4km? Will my slowness be taken as not putting in effort? I am willing to put in everything I've got to get my running timing down during BMT, but I need a chance to start training from my standard onwards, and not just mindlessly run 2.4km in 13/14min each time and getting tekan-ed even further.

2. Almost directly linked to 1, how often would we be expected to run? Intervals, endurance runs etc. A rough gauge (e.g 3-4 times a week ) would be nice.

3. How do I maximize my chances to get into command school? Besides being a wayang king. 

4. How's the food like? I don't really care about nice or not, I've had my fair share of nasty food ( thank you secondary school ), but more importantly, how's the portion and time allocated to eating? I'm those sort who are always hungry and eats like a cow. But I also get indigestion easily if I have to eat alot with very little time, and when I'm hungry I tend to have gastric quite easily. ( around 6 hours without food can give me gastric already ).

5. This is what I'm most worried about. Breakfast. I'm not sure if anyone here is the same as me, but I just cannot eat breakfast for some reason. Whenever I eat breakfast, I get diarrhea. Anything I consume in the morning comes out as uncontrollable liquid waste in 2/3 hours time. How do I bypass this in NS? I'm afraid that if I don't eat breakfast, 1. no energy to last till lunch 2. low blood sugar later faint or if I force myself, halfway through training need go shit.

From this point on, you guys have the choice to either, get your A levels or Diploma.

Personally, I don't know much about getting your A levels. But from what I've seen, it is the safe route of ensuring a degree for those who are eligible.

Since I don't know much, I'll allow someone else to shed light on that. 

But here's my message for students interested in getting a diploma:

To all the O level students that did not meet cutoff points for whichever course you are interested in. 

Here's a valuable tip that I was giving out during the open house period to all the parents and students. It would be valuable to you especially if that certain course is related to the arts, or something unconventional. It may not work for engineering or academic based courses, but heck, give it a try.

Appeal.

I'm serious, appeal. Do whatever you can and clinch that interview with the course co-ordinator. The reason why I am saying this is because, I have seen many friends that are in some shitty course that they have never considered before and wasting their time there and wasting your life away. Some of you guys may argue that, clinching that diploma is your safe bet to a job, go get the degree you want later, make do with what you have. NO, go try your best to get the course you want, if all else fails do that. Don't make do with what you have, fight for what you want.

Back to the topic, why appeal? Lecturers today love proactive students. They like to teach people who are actually interested in what they are teaching. I mean, you want someone to be interested in what you are saying right? That is the reason why you need that interview and show your talent/passion/interest in that field. It doesn't really matter how you do it, be it JAE, JPSAE, or even straight up stalking and looking for the course co-ordinator's email themselves, try to get that chance to speak to them and get that interview.

I'll be 100% sure that you would be considered into the course. 

O level aggregate ain't gonna matter to you once you're achieving your diploma.

Don't be lazy. Appeal. Do your shit. Plan your future.

At this moment of life, whatever you do decides your future. Don't screw it ",blametheelephants,life is shit

MC on BMT,2,2lr2x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2lr2x9/mc_on_bmt/,17,2014-11-10 02:04:54,"I am serving my NS now, the confinement period. My PES status is C9L2. I am physically fit and I'm very particular about fitness. Unfortunately I fell down 1.5 years ago during gymnastics and fractured my wrist so that explains for my PES status. They said it's a temporary PES because I will have to go for a surgery to fix my broken wrist, after which I may be able to up my PES status.
Life is honestly very boring being in PES C and excused from upper limb exercises. I can't even play captain's ball. WTH. I'm just sitting down for most of the physical activities which I find that time pass even slower.
I understand from my sergeants and officers that to up PES I will have to retake BMT again to go through field camps and leadership training etc. I feel that it's so troublesome to go through everything again. So maybe I'll wait till my BMT is over then I'll fix an appointment for a surgery.
However yesterday, my third day of confinement, I slipped and fell forward. I landed on my injured wrist and that was it, it started hurting real badly. It was painful, but it's bearable because I'm used to the pain that my wrist have given me throughout the 1.5 years. I asked to see the MO because I wanted to get medical gel to apply on the injured wrist. That didn't happen but instead they say they'll have to send me to mainland to do an x-ray. I was thinking, hmmm mainland means I get to go home and probably got a few days MC off. That's not bad...
Then BAM... when I saw the doctor, they gave me 3 WEEKS hospitalisation MC. I knew I am screwed. The MC ends on 1st December 2014, which is 1 week more of BMT before I'm posted to vocational training. I'm really depressed now as I don't want to serve another round of BMT. I can't do shit because in the army the doctor's words are final.
I'm wondering if there's anyway I can do to not retake BMT?
Honestly why do they have to give me 3 weeks MC and I have to stay home? Why can't they just give me a few days off then let me get back to camp and sit through the 1 month of BMT in tekong? Besides, I don't get to do any physical activities also during BMT and I can't get out of home... so why can't I just be there to sit through so I don't have to retake BMT?
Please help me! I'm so depress",benningtonsoon,life is shit

Their online notice is [here.](http://www.starhub.com/imail) But I prefer the email version because it's actually signed off by someone. 

Well, you would had noticed that I mentioned consumers only, because their business email subscribers still get to use the xxxxx@starhub.net.sg addresses. You can find that if you click on one of their [faqs on their web notice](http://www.starhub.com/personal/support/broadband/maintenance-message/faq.html) 

The timing was great as usual, perfectly timed for that nice Christmas eve surprise. And did they just insinuated that they are ending the service due to Google terminating the support? My subscription fees are paid to Starhub, not Google. The Gmail-like platform was nice but I could live with the old email interface. They could just go back to that. But no, blame Google. 

I had been using their email @starhub.net.sg for many years. More than a decade I would say. And they just dropped us, paying customers, like a sack of bricks without any alternatives. Oh but there are alternatives! You can just port over to their business email plans! But they are not interested in your business, because if they were, they would had mentioned it in their email. Nope, it's a lot easier to just cancel the whole shebang and show you the door. 

I paid for email services because I was worried that those free email services can just end anytime. I paid for security and peace of mind. The fool I was. 

So what does this never ending rant got to do with those who weren't as stupid as I was? See how Starhub values their paying customers? Today me, tomorrow you. Don't make the mistake I did in trusting them. Yeah yeah, I know it's just an email address, it's an inconvenience, not really life threatening, but I just got to rage in this cage. I could just change to their business email plans (which also costs a lot more) and keep my @starhub.net.sg address. I could. And MAYBE LET THEM FUCK ME UP AGAIN WHEN THEY CANCEL THAT TOO.

No thanks. 

/end rant.

tl;dr Starhub don't give a shit about it's customers. Gasp! 

*Consider this as a PSA, you decide if Starhub is a shitty service provider. I don't care about compensation, nothing is going to keep me with Starhub. I had already started changing my account emails with every damn website, bank, forum, online store",ayam,life is shit

We do not know what has happened, and I do not condone what she has done if she did something wrong. Maybe she was coerced into a relationship (she is a scholar what means that she cannot leave if she doesn't like it). Maybe she did it out of her own free will. 

But she deserved to be treated with sensitivity and compassion and not to be slut-shamed. 

---

EDIT: 

She was a scholar. Means if she not happy, she cannot leave easily. I can relate in a way cos there was a time I was really unhappy with someone, she is a real bitch to work with but I also realized I cannot leave easily. Luckily it was only for a few months then I said bye bye to that bitch in a polite manner.

Sexual coercion do happen. The two editors could have used their influence over her to pressure her to have sex. If I were in such a situation, I would leave because sexual coercion is hard to prove and you see even the big boss of sph at most demoted them. So if you brought it up to the SPH HR ""organically"" (claiming being pressured to have sex by your boss) forget about it lol.

- Why did no counselor or school faculty member contact the parents immediately? 
- Why the school let a 14 yr old kid go to the police station alone? Can't wait for the parents to come in and accompany him?

CPF Investments?,0,9huet2,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9huet2/cpf_investments/,7,2018-09-22 13:54:14,"""This is a solid guarantee.""

&#x200B;

""Yes, your CPF monies are safe as all CPF monies are invested in securities (SSGS) that are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government. ""

&#x200B;

[https://www.mof.gov.sg/Policies/Our-Nations-Reserves/Section-IV-Is-our-CPF-money-safe-Can-the-Government-pay-all-its-debt-obligations](https://www.mof.gov.sg/Policies/Our-Nations-Reserves/Section-IV-Is-our-CPF-money-safe-Can-the-Government-pay-all-its-debt-obligations)

&#x200B;

Anyone who's been in investment for sometime knows that there is no such thing ""guarantee"" in investment, there is only high chance of returns or low chance of returns. There are a lot of words in this page talking about AAA rating, ownself praising ownself, even I can call myself AAA, meaningless words like secruities, and all that jazz. But one thing they didn't mention is EXACTLY which stock they are using CPF to buy. Is the stock so good that it will never be bearish? 

&#x200B;

Which brings the question, what exactly is the government investing in? Are the persons handling CPF money foreigners or Singaporeans? Names of these ""AAA rating"" Investors? Is this why there is a rapid increase in inflation in Singapore? 

&#x200B;

There are 2 unethical ways that the government can guarantee an investment positive, forced conscription\[Or some form of slavery one form or another in or outside the country\] and taking advantage of uneducated financial idiots. By forced conscription I'm talking about NS, anyone who is born in SG(or outside\[or not since not all foreign males go NS before allowed to work in Singapore\]) and is a male know what forced means, there is no choice.

&#x200B;

If you don't know how real investment works, don't comment on this issue. Real investment compromises not just one but a combination of a number of factors, for instance, political stability in a country. You can't open a club without a bouncer.

&#x200B;

NS is a cheap sham for defense, $1/hr. The only things holding this scheme is patrionia(myth), greed, selfishness and dog-eat-dog society thanks to Defense Minister has created. It doesn't make sense, the females during the song dynasty practice foot-binding as a sign of beauty, should it be brought back today just because it was mandatory?  There was a pitiful $100 NS50 voucher given in exchange of 2 years financial damage loss of \~$30k, it's pretty pathetic. $2k-$560=$1.44k, $1.4kx24=$34,560. + Opportunity costs may be up to $100k.

&#x200B;

Singapore's Patrionia is a myth because workers in Singapore's army are overpaid, If patriotic is the main reason for National Defense. Then, there is no need for officials working there to be paid $5k, $10k, $50k/mth. While NSF are paid measly of around $560/mth for 2 years, about $1/hr. If you reduce the pay scale to maximum $1k for all workers, you will see how many of the rats in the army will run. Power is given to money, thus patriotic is a myth. Officials are more often than not, paid much more than they are worth. With NSF deaths happening annually, suicides, unhappiness, garbage tier attitude shows Officials care little about ethics and citizens, but about themselves and their paycheck. This is not surprising as they know the nature of the business is to force males born in Singapore to ""Serve"" ""National Service"". Can't be anymore sarcastic. Anyway, people working there will come here very soon to disagree without logic as their masters are holding the checkbook. 

&#x200B;

There is a movie called ah boys to men, but in reality, it's ah men to pussies. The movie shows little gullible boys to be beta bitches. Not revolt against the low paying, garbage treatment policy. It distracts the public of the real problems NS can cause, sabotage, death, financial ruin, etc. No matter how you shift the equation, NSFs are the losers in this equation.

&#x200B;

You may argue PM serve NS, but bear in mind that he has million dollar salary now and most likely knew he won't have any financial problems whatsoever after. Which ""ordinary citizen"" here is going to earn that much money after they finish forced conscription? Probably not you. With foreigners and PR taking even your diploma level jobs and government jobs now in Singapore, you won't be guaranteed with a good job position after you are out anymore. Foreigners are cheaper so why hire Singaporeans? Singaporeans need money to buy leased HDB, Foreigners work for a few years and retire back home. NS is to protect against foreign invasion, but they have already invaded the island legally & openly stealing your rice bowl, fail.

&#x200B;

The value of a citizenship is based on the % of foreigners in a country, and the difference in treatment with citizens & non-citizens. Close to 50% of people in Singapore are foreigners, and rising, since birth rate is very low, and there is no real difference in treatment except some small discounts for citizens here and there. It doesn't even have the power of dual citizenship like most countries. The Value of Singapore Citizenship is very low, all the less reason to be patriotic. 

&#x200B;

As for uneducated idiots, I'm talking about taking advantage of people who have no idea how trade works. For example, day trading, study 1 day graphs to see if it will go up using some lines learnt from some con person on youtube. Or maybe telling our neighbor that water can't be measured by money but by years of benevolence, hilarious. Same thing said for National Service, officials pay lip service saying National Slavery is a ""Privileged"". But at the backstage, have expensive cars, going overseas multiple times a year for holidays, living extravagantly, laughing with their huge paycheck in the bank.

&#x200B;

Or you know, ""Donations"".

&#x200B;

Questions: 

What exactly is the government investing in?

Are the persons handling CPF money foreigners or Singaporeans? 

If they are foreigners, are their qualifications falsified or genuine? How can they prove that their success is not manipulated by collectivism?

Names of these ""AAA rating"" Investors?

Studying in Japan as a Singaporean,34,9apjct,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9apjct/studying_in_japan_as_a_singaporean/,64,2018-08-28 06:47:42,"Yo, I’d like to ask some questions about studying in Japan. I’ve read some of the posts about studying in Japan, but the OPs just seem a little… stuck in a fantasy. I’m just considering studying Japan, so I’d like to hear both the good and bad, and also learn a little about studying there. Hoping to get some more Singaporean perspective too. If I sound like an ass, please tell me. I don’t want to end up wasting my time in the end.

I’m taking my A Levels in a few months, and will be going into army after that. I’m planning to learn Japanese during army, and even if I don’t study in Japan, I’m still doing that for my own interest. I’ve talked briefly to some people that visited my school, and from what I heard from them is that taking the MEXT Scholarship is really the best option for me. I could afford to study there without a scholarship, but I rather not spend so much of my parent’s money. I’m planning to take some form of engineering, but I’m still deciding what course specifically. Hoping to get into either Kyodai or Todai.

Finally, I’d just like to make it clear that I’m considering studying in Japan. It’s not set in stone, I still have quite a bit of time to reconsider studying in Japan. Also need to not fuck up my As, but thats another story entirely. I’m fully aware that Japan isn’t a perfect utopia, and I definitely do not have some weaboo fantasy about living the anime life amongst fellow otaku. I’d like to think that I’m pretty aware of Japanese culture and stuff.

So here are my questions

* How realistic is me learning Japanese in those 2 years in army? I know very very very very basic Japanese (just assume I don’t speak any at all), and I don’t speak Chinese, so I don’t know the characters either. I’m almost guaranteed a clerk role in the army, so hopefully I have more free time to study Japanese and reach fluency.

* So I’m planning to take a physics related course, but I don’t really know much. I’ll look more into it on my own, but is there anything I should be aware of that isn’t in official documents?
* What’s the MEXT scholarship actually like? From what I’ve heard, I apply at the Embassy, take a bunch of tests/interviews, and based on those results, I’m allowed to choose from a list of universities. Is there anything else I should know about this? I’ve read the official website, but it honestly does not explain much. I’d like to know what's the difficulty like and stuff like that.
* Accommodation. What is living in a Japanese dorm like? I’ve heard that quite a few overseas student also end up renting an apartment instead.
* Also, cost. I’m sure most scholarships cover the basics (i.e studying at the university proper, accommodation and stuff like that), but 120000Y doesn’t seem that much when I consider the living costs. I can cook, but I’m not sure if that’s possible in dorm arrangements, and even so it's still pretty costly. 
* Relating to JC, what are the subject requirements for applying to a physics related course? I take H2 Physics and H1 Chemistry. Is that sufficient? I’m worried about that H1 Chemistry. What other things should I take note of as well, if I’m using my A Level results? Most other posts only deal with poly graduates, haven’t seen any JC graduates.
* How is academic life like at a Japanese university? How rigorous is it, especially learning in Japanese? From what I’ve read, universities in Japan are quite slack, but what does this mean in comparison to Singapore?
*How is social life like at a Japanese university? I’m definitely planning to immerse myself in Japanese culture as much as possible. I don’t want to go to Japan and end up just hanging out with foreigners instead of actually dealing with Japanese people.
* What are my opportunities after graduating from university? I’m hoping to actually work and live in Japan, and I’m sure studying in Japan is great for that, but what about working in other nations?
* How is it like adjusting to Japanese climate from someone who lived his whole life in Singapore? I’ve visited Japan multiple times (always in Nov-Dec period), and I think I can cope with the cold weather.
* How restricting is it to have to spend one extra year studying Japanese before actually entering the university? I already spend 2 years in the army, and I don’t want to end up someone whose in his late 20s and still hasn’t found a job.

I think that’s about it. I’ve spent quite a bit of time making this post, so please try to take it seriously. And of course, thanks for reading through the whole thing. Even if you can’t answer everything, I’d still like to hear your perspective.

EDIT: Thanks for the help, everyone. I'm pretty busy with studying for As right now as well, but I will definitely try to reply to your comments as soon as I c",cheekia,hanging myself

My secondary school was somewhere in Bedok (i'm not gonna disclose from where i am from) I'm pretty much hanging out with chill out guys who likes to listen to Grunge rock and Punk Rock. So yes being Malay and saving your lunch money to go to the nearest Jamming studio after school was pretty much a mat-rock thing to do that time. 

The only ""ECA"" or in modern terms ""CCA"" i was in was in NCC. The best thing about being in a Uniform group was invitations to Camp Fires organized by the Scouts or Girl Guides. That was the only time i can meet other girls from other schools. There was one time I actually begged a classmate of mind to give me an invitation because i really liked this girl from TKSS and i have something ""prepared"" for her. That night of the camp fire, i went up on stage while the fire was burning and played an awful rendition to Walking After You from the Foo Fighters and dedicate it to her (i'll never forgive myself for that). Well unfortunately, she was into someone else and didnt see me that way. 

I remember going to Tower records (before HMV was a thing) after school. There were no such thing as Spotify or youtube back then and we only download music from napster? Always looking for our favourite bands CD that was on sale after that make our way to Swee Lee and look at guitars we cant afford and dreamt big. 

Later into my Secondary School year, I had a huge crush on this girl who was well 2 years my junior.  I remembered seeing her for the first time while i was queuing for food, she was walked passed me from the queue. She inspired me to write a poem and i slipped it into her bag when her class was out for recess. Someone told me her boyfriend found out and got jealous and tried to write a poem for her and failed miserably. One day a friend of mine was looking for a dance performance for teachers day.. She told me my crush was part of it.. 1) I dont dance 2) I will do anything to be this close to her. Apparently she  got me in and partner me with her, I cant dance but i tried my best? It was embarrassing but fortunately I'll be performing with my band on the same stage. All the while i was looking for her while i was playing.. yeah she was looking at me and i thought she was so into me. I tried to ask her out after that but was never successful.. So then it was O-Levels and never got her out. Two years after i got out of Secondary School, i found out my own best friend, my own wing man got into a relationship with her. Well.. i had to man up and accept defeat but we are still best friends until now.

Although one may be able to criticize the study statistically due to it being selection bias, small sample size, potential issue with the framing of the study to push a pre-written narrative, failure to account for missing participants etc etc. One thing that can't be denied is that it is seen as an issue with Singapore today.

&#x200B;

What constitutes as an elitist?

1)Common perception of people among the common folk as well as students today appear to be those that come from very good schools. Your usual HCI,RI,ACSI etc etc. Which is commonly associated with having a larger significant proportion of their students attaining the top of the bell-curve aka they get all the As.   
2)What also constitutes as elitist according to some people is the income level of a person also know as Socio-Economic Status ( SES ) as people like to call it.  
Some may wonder what happens if it is a Poor SES student in RI,HCI or ACSI? Are they constituted as an elitist? But then one definition of the word is being self-contradictory with the other definition people like to go by.   


General consensus is that elitists is something where a person sees himself as a higher being within the society hierarchy. It is flexible in its meaning where you can see it being thrown anywhere and everywhere as long as there are rankings.

&#x200B;

It is inherently a mentality in my view. Not something that is attached to a person simply because he/she gets the lucky draw of being born in a blessed family. Or is working hard in school for a better future entering an elite school to be part of the 20% poor-to-rich fluidity in the country.

&#x200B;

Nuture vs Nature?

In the basic studies between people, we judge a person within 7 seconds. The entire impression of you is formed within another person's mind. It is a biological mechanical tool, it helps us determine if the person is somebody we would like to be associated with as well as see any foreseeable benefits of us being associated with such person. It is the simple reason why you work Over-Time for your boss, you see not losing your job and getting a promotion being of importance hence you will need to be good in your boss's eyes. The mechanical tool of judging is as such.  


However, that is when elitism enters, because such tool is being used commonly, it simply produces data for the person to interpret. This person is holding an iPhone X, he has a high probability of being wealthy in a sense. Your child points out that other children's parents are able to fetch them with their fancy Audi and it sinks in him/her that they are not as well-off as the rest. Or maybe you notice your friends posting on Instagram that they are studying very hard, you change your perception of what you know about them and take note that they are publicizing they are working hard.  


These are all just data to the mind and conclusions it makes up.  


Streaming, is it necessary?  


Streaming has been a rather hot-topic especially for parents in Singapore's school system. It dictates to a significant probability where your child will end up for the next 4 years. Breaking up the cohort into streams based on higher level of content knowledge and speed of studies.   


The short answer is. Yes it is necessary.

As you all know, Singapore has no natural resources, we only have people. If MOE were to handicap the capable and hardworking so as to play by the slowest among society, we will be wasting potential talents as well as hindering competitiveness of society when we are to fight against other countries. Imagine if streaming was scrapped, in an alternate reality where everything everybody learns is the same. The same breadth, same speed and same time. If we were to play by the slowest denominator of the cohort imagine only studying Algebra by lets say... Primary 4. Or learning Hypothesis Testing only in University. Or even maybe learning the basics of chemical bonds at age 18. If you compare this against other countries, it may not seem as bad. But other countries have other sources of revenue. We have mainly our workforce as well as our net-exports to drive our economy. We will essentially be losing around 30-40% of our economy if our workforce is deemed sub-par with the world. Please note these are rough estimates and not representative of actual data because it is difficult to tell how much we will actually lose. Until we actually do lose it. Which is something none of us would like.  


Back to the main point,there are speculations by people that streaming causes elitism. Yes it is a fact it does contribute to it. Imagine if you were to win a competition, you would be given first prize as well as trophies and all of the glory that is associated with it. Normally, you would of course believe you are better than others, because you have been recognized and accorded as such by the people authorized to do so. Streaming essentially does this. It gives people their 'class' in a sense. It tells them how good or bad they are. That is a fact and can't be sugar-coated by teachers or otherwise. It is a label. Same as entering a good school, an elite school, top class etc etc. They are all labels. It may be disappointing to see that how we treat others is based on these labels and not essentially based on who they are as a person. Then again, drawing back to the point supra (above). We judge people. These labels help make that judging easier.   


If you were to spot a person with piercings as well as tattoos all over their face and body. What will you inherently conclude? That he is a gangster? That he has a criminal record?  


Those conclusions are reasonable. People often times who want to argue for the sake of arguing will say 'not all' people with tattoos are gangsters. They are of course making statement against blanket statements about tattoos being equivalent to gangsters. They in that sense are technically correct. But they do not acknowledge that there is a fair to reasonable chance that a person with tattoos and piercings are in fact more likely to be gangsters versus somebody with a proper trimmed haircut and looks like an average school student. Which is why people come to these conclusions.  


These labels come with information, about the general population of that label and characteristics that they are more than likely to have. 

&#x200B;

Which is why we come to this, where perception between the classes are different from reality. Nothing in this world is absolute when it comes to data or blanket statements. That is the beauty of humanity. We are all different, with different experience, upbringing and lives. We move and operate on our own moral compass and passion in life.   


So is this nurture or nature? To answer that question, it is best we look over our borders. A very good counter to the nurture vs nature argument is Japan. If you have ever been to Japan and spoken to Japanese locals. They are taught from a very young age that they are to respect every job. From construction workers, to cleaners, to people who do dishwashing. Respecting them is ingrained in their society because they know, those that benefit to live a good life has done so on the backs of others. They should not belittle those that contribute to society so others can prosper. As without a bottom, there can be no top.  


Now that we know to relative degree that it is not nature but nurture, you may wonder if we can do the same as Japan? Seems like a reasonable conclusion to make. If it works for others why not have it work for us? The issue with this is perception and attitude. These are two values that span across generations. We may be able to implement such a change within our education system. The change will probably take several decades, should it succeed we will be rid of this problem. But it does not solve the issue today, or tomorrow, or the next.

&#x200B;

One of the ways maybe we can solve this in the short term is social-penalizing of such attitudes. Where if you hear somebody make a statement like ""People who take public transports are peasants"" (reference to you know what), then social-penalizing and telling off will be good so that people who have begun to develop such mentalities know that it is wrong. But of course this will require majority of the people to participate, even those who believe they themselves are elite to peer-check on other elites among them, which is highly unlikely unless they have the view of society as a whole in consideration knowing it is better for the country as a whole that this stops before it fragments everything.

&#x200B;

So if we judge people based on labels. Where it was obvious during the exchange between the IP student ant the NT student. How do we make these impressions go away?  


For the foreseeable short term future, you can't. At least not entirely. Remember previously concluded that biologically we want to be together with others who are like us. It is easier to relate, easier to communicate and easier to empathize. The statement that the top does not empathize with the bottom is true. As much as some people at the top may like to disagree, it is true (Unless you came from both). You will only FREELY \*huge emphasis\* hang around people of similar background simply because it is easier. Lesser barriers to entry. Path of least resistance.  A simple question will be the following:  
""Do you hang around people with Tattoos?""  
""Do you hang around with people who owns a sports car?""

""Do you hang around people who lives in 2-room HDB flats?""  
""Do you hang around with the uncle you see by the void deck smoking?""

...

""Why not?""

We hang around people who are easier to relate. It prevents social awkwardness. Like in the video where the NT student says it is difficult to speak to people of other streams due to the nature of which the language is spoken, making it difficult for him to keep up.

&#x200B;

So now we know why people don't speak to one another. What can we do about it? The best thing you can do. Which I can't strongly encourage is...  


""Don't be a prick""

&#x200B;

Even if the guy with tattoos is by the void deck, or the sports car driver coming to pick up their children, or you see the family from the 2-room flat at the hawker centre, even the uncle by the void deck smoking, be nice. Be friendly. Be proper.

&#x200B;

It does no good to society as well as people's perception of you if you are smiling one moment while gossiping about how ""he/she is from X neighbourhood school and is very bad hence he/she must be inherently bad as well"" or during Chinese New Year, ""Wah your child only got 180 for PSLE? Mine got 257!"" or ""Why you go university study X? Why never study Law or Medicine!"".

&#x200B;

Don't belittle others. Everybody is just trying to make their way through life. Nobody likes difficult people. Singapore is already counted as a utopia by many and I sincerely believe we have enough problems on our hands \*cough\* crooked bridge \*cough\* from external sources. We don't need more trouble from ourselves.

  
It is still very heartwarming to see times where we help each other out when needed. In situations where we are under threat or harm we tend to throw all these social issues out the window and band together as one. Which is one thing I like about our society, we know how to prioritize.   


Meanwhile, we can continue complaining about the MRT or how Singtel had outage last night.  


Peace out, please be nice to everybody. It's a friday. Let's all just relax after a hard day of work.

A current personal favourite of mine. Very catchy pop songs. Similar to Ed Sheeran

Absolutely love their concept and live performances. Basically what they do is to record loops of Weish's voice, like a sound gif. Soon you'll get layers upon layers of her voice which forms this awesome wall of sound. Very impressive to watch them perform live

**Pixel Apartment**
A one man band who mixes in elements of visual art as well. Not the best singer but an amazing composer.

An acquaintance of mine and have been following his music since secondary school. It has been interesting to watch how his music has evolved through the years

Thoughts on burning of joss paper in public areas,105,4sfdlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4sfdlk/thoughts_on_burning_of_joss_paper_in_public_areas/,124,2016-07-12 21:16:01,"#Thoughts on burning of joss paper in public areas
Greater control is required over the burning of joss paper in public areas. This essay discusses why as well as what can be done.

&nbsp;

###The Conditions Have Changed
*****
While burning of joss paper has been part of Chinese culture for centuries, conditions in modern Singapore have made the practice questionable:

#####1. High-rise residential areas.
Smoke rises. In ancient China and kampong Singapore, residential areas were low-rise. This meant that if burning occurred in the vicinity of houses, most of the smoke rose and diffused into the atmosphere. In modern Singapore, a plume of smoke 10 meters from an apartment block rises straight into apartments. Many residents end up with smoke in their homes before they realize that burning has begun. Those who close their windows in time often end up with ashy windows and smoke seeping through imperfect seals.

#####2. Extremely dense residential areas.
Population density in modern Singapore is several orders of magnitude greater than it was in ancient China and kampong Singapore. In fact Singapore has the third highest population density in the world. Density has had two effects in relation to burning of joss paper. The first is that burning occurs far more regularly, simply because there are more people in the same area who want to burn. The second is that burning often happens in close proximity to residential buildings since buildings are packed quite densely in many areas. Both these effects mean that for an individual, close proximity burning can occur several times a week, all year round. Furthermore, for some, close proximity burning can be nearly continuous during 7th month.

#####3. Greater understanding of the health effects of joss burning.
Researchers have written papers with unequivocal proof of the health effects of joss burning. Apart from the phlegm, sore throat and sore eyes it can cause, smoke from joss burning contains cancer causing carcinogens. Worse still, a study in Taiwan has shown that [incense smoke has a significant detrimental effect on male new born weight and head circumference](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/15-09922/). Some joss products burnt these days are also adorned with extremely toxic substances.

&nbsp;

###Religious Harmony Is Built On Compromise
*****
Calls for restrictions on joss paper burning have been made before. Oftentimes, opponents of such calls respond with accusations of religious intolerance. For that reason I'd like to cite examples of how religious harmony has been maintained in Singapore through compromise.

#####1. Muslim call to prayer
The Muslim call to prayer was regarded as a disturbance for non Muslims due to its volume. Laws were imposed, prohibiting prayer calls from being broadcast loudly and outwards. Despite it being a religious practice, Muslims accepted the imposed laws and adapted, compromising for the greater good.

#####2. Christian proselytizing
Sharing the faith is a big part of Christianity. However, proselytizing affected the sensibilities of adherents to other religions; as a result, the government banned aggressive proselytizing in Singapore. Christians accepted it and adapted, compromising for the greater good.

#####3. Hindu musical instruments
Live musical instruments have long been part of Thaipusam. However, they were deemed to be a disturbance due to noise levels and were thus banned. The Hindus accepted the ban and adapted, compromising for the greater good.

&nbsp;

###Religious Practices Must Adapt
*****
Religious harmony cannot be a one way street. Practices with large negative externalities cannot be shielded by a veneer of religiosity such that non-believers have no means of recourse. There must be a point at which a religious practice becomes untenable due to its negative externalities. It is in this vein that I believe greater control of joss burning is required. No other religious practice has comparably severe effects on so many. Furthermore, forcing the negative externalities on non-believers can end up hurting religious harmony since some affected individuals may take out their frustration on the religion and its adherents in fits of irrationality. Adapting practices to changing conditions and compromising for the greater good is essential to maintaining religious harmony. The following are steps I feel the authorities should take to help joss burning adapt to modern Singapore:

#####1. Ban burning of materials with toxic chemicals.
The addition of toxic chemicals isn't even an old cultural practice. This should be an obvious step. Fumes produced by the burning of colorful products like those listed [here](http://thesmartlocal.com/read/unexpected-kim-zua) are especially noxious.

#####2. Limit the amount that can be burnt at a time.
A Singaporean Taoist leader has mentioned that burning is a symbolic practice and burning large amounts is not necessary.

#####3. Enforce burning in town council bins.
Private open air cages like [these](http://imgur.com/WDoZnBP) produce significant amounts of smoke and ash. If they are allowed at all they should be kept well clear of dense residential estates. Companies that rent them like [this one] (https://www.facebook.com/youzhi.burner/) must be regulated.

#####4. Prohibit burning within a radius from dense residential estates.
This can be done partly by encouraging burning at temples as well as by carefully situating burning cans in open areas.

&nbsp;

###Conclusion
*****
Empathy and humility are essential to tackling this problem. This is because some Singaporeans are affected disproportionately by it. Inhabitants of apartment buildings who live in lower levels are affected more than inhabitants of higher levels or landed properties. Inhabitants of areas with more adherents are also more affected. Before writing off the problem as insignificant, consider what it would feel like to live close to a burning bin: throughout the year, your house could end up full of carcinogenic cancer causing ash - at any time.  


Religious practices must be respected, but regulations are required to help practices adapt to modern Singapore.

What is Halal Food?,50,30tj7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/30tj7e/what_is_halal_food/,67,2015-03-31 08:19:55,"Just saw the topic about halal food being brought up again, thought I'd [repost my own comment from over a week ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2zlh54/when_has_the_muslims_in_singapore_become_so/cpk8qip) about what halal is. This is just an explanation because I think I've seen a lot of misconception both within and outside of the Muslim community about what halal really is. There are some who think it's just ""no pork, no lard, no alcohol"", assuming everything else is fair game. Well, it's not exactly that straightforward. 

Halal is to Muslims what kosher is to Jews. The regulations for food to be [kosher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_foods) is actually more strict than it is for food to be halal. In fact, the regulations are very similar for both Abrahamic religions that it is widely accepted that [Muslims are allowed to eat kosher foods too, as long as they don't contain alcohol.](http://www.eat-halal.com/opinion-are-muslims-allowed-to-eat-kosher-according-to-islam/) Jews, however, will find that not all halal food are permissible to them 

First and foremost what's outright *impermissible* for Muslims? Carrion/carcass, blood or pork. 

> ""He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."" (Qurʼan 2:173)

Special mention for frogs.
> Abd al-Rahmaan ibn 'Uthmaan, according to which a doctor asked the Prophet about using frogs in medicine, and the Prophet forbade killing them. (Hadith narrated by Abu Dawood, classed as authentic by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo')

Also, donkeys. 
> The Prophet reached Khaibar in the morning, while the people were coming out carrying their spades over their shoulders. When they saw him they said, ""This is Muhammad and his army! Muhammad and his army!"" So, they took refuge in the fort. The Prophet raised both his hands and said, ""Allahu Akbar, Khaibar is ruined, for when we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then miserable is the morning of the warned ones."" Then we found some donkeys which we (killed and) cooked: The announcer of the Prophet announced: ""Allah and His Apostle forbid you to eat donkey's meat."" So, all the pots including their contents were turned upside down. (Hadith narrated by Anas ibn Malik, from Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 234) 

And...no intoxicants.
> ""O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?"" (Qur'an 5:90-91)

So, what's permissible? Seafood, is fair game.

> ""Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you [who are settled] as well as for travellers, although you are forbidden to hunt on land while you are in the state of pilgrimage. And be conscious of God, unto whom you shall be gathered."" (Qurʼan 5:96.)

So, where does this leave the other meats, like chicken, beef, mutton, etc? For them to be halal, they'll need to be [slaughtered accordingly; first with a mention of God's name, then by ""a swift, deep incision with a sharp knife on the throat, cutting the jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord intact.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah) Failure to do so will render the meat impermissible for Muslim consumption. 

There are, of course, exceptions to these rules: if you're dying of thirst or hunger and there are no alternatives, any of the impermissible foods become permissible for consumption according to the law of necessity in Islamic jurisprudence. 

So, while there may be no pork or lard in certain food establishments, the food (meats, in particular) is not automatically permissible for Muslims because it is not known if they were slaughtered accordingly. Halal certification helps a lot in this case, as the ingredients for all foods prepared in that establishment would have been vetted and inspected regularly to be permissible. 

I hope this helped to shed some light on why Muslims, many of whom are conscious about what they eat, deem the halal certification to be importan",cherenkov_blue,vein

* whole blood (regular donation) **OR**
* platelets and plasma ([apheresis](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate/apheresis.html))

Apheresis is recommended for non-first timers in my opinion.

Apheresis requires large veins that will not collapse for the hour long procedure.

I tried once but it collapsed halfway. They told me to try again in 2 years.

**Highly recommended to make an appointment before going down**

-Its pretty fast, can just make a phone call or use your SingPass

-You get placed in a priority line, which speed things up a bit depending on the crowd that day.

Once inside, this is the rough flow of things.

1. Fill up Questionnaire, hand it in.

2. Wait to be called for the doctor to take your blood pressure, temperature etc.

3. Next station, they prick a finger to test your haemoglobin levels to see whether you meet the minimum. 

4. Enter the area with the chairs, and the staff will get you prepared for the procedure, pretty friendly, though it seems that they use similar lines to make donors feel at ease, better than nothing though.

5. Vein check, inject anaesthesia, etc, the actual process itself.

6. Wait for blood to be drawn out, 450 mls. My bag took 3:30 for it to be filled.

The actual process itself is very much shorter than the form-filling and waiting. Pretty fast, total time is close to half hour.

During the process itself the staff will hand you a food voucher, 
and some iron tablets to replenish your iron supply.

**If you visit in between 11.30 and 1.30pm**

It is considered lunchtime and a full meal will be redeemed using the voucher.

Other times would just be a snack.

I also received a pretty thick notebook. Hardcover and bound pretty nicely. Came in a plastic cover shaped like a blood bag and a sticker/decal that mimicked a blood bag label.

On top of that there was also an extra gift because of donating during my birthday month. It was an handheld electric fan with a pretty cute and cool function, where it flashed ""Happy Birthday"". Good for a chuckle.

Sourcing for clothes for asian to below-average build men,10,8v88t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8v88t7/sourcing_for_clothes_for_asian_to_belowaverage/,45,2018-07-01 22:58:37,"Hi everyone, i would like to seek some advice from fashion experts on where to get clothing for men who are generally smaller to below average in build. I am about 5 ft 5 inch with an ectomorph body type. I generally have a lot of trouble shopping for clothes since sizing always seem to be a big issue; for retail shops a lot of times the clothing there are western-cut, leaving them either too wide or too long or totally out of my sizing range right off the bat.

I have explored other options in online fashion stores like ASOS and zalora but it is still a challenge to find something that fits, and if they don't there is the hassle of returning goods, much like a trial and error. More often than not, i find myself receiving goods that are below my expectation in terms of the overall sizing and quality. I have also visited other fashion retailers which are known to have a selection specially catered to asian men, such as Topman, zara, pull&bear, cotton-on, uniqlo, H&M, but still i normally leave the shops empty-handed, having found nothing that really suits me in the cut and fitting, not to mention the design and usually steep price that is tagged to it. While they do have certain clothes that might fit, the catalogs are few and far between.

For formal clothing, usually that is not a concern since most men do get them custom-tailored with proper measurements to fit them nicely anyway, but needless to say they don't come cheap. So it goes without saying that i don't think that is applicable and sustainable to other normal clothing that you wear out to town, just to meet friends or hangout over a meal or a drinking session. This limited range of clothing are my biggest problem as the choices in my wardrobe are so limited since i usually stick to those that i feel comfortable in despite them being slightly aged as time passes.

**TLDR summary: I would like to hear from fashion gurus where do men around my size (5 ft 5 inch) normally turn to for their source of clothing?**

It does not matter what the kind of clothes they are as i am open to clothes of any occasions; smart-casual, formal, casual, informal etc. as i have been looking to revamp my wardrobe for a very long time. Be it physical or online shops, i still would like your input as they will certainly add on as inspiration and more options for me to give them a go to look into. Most importantly, i would like to know those shops that are trusted and reliable by many long-time customers since they would suggest they are doing something right to cater to this group of people, where sizing is of paramount importance before we even talk about design and pricing.

I deeply appreciate any form of input, since i can't seem to put a solution to this problem that i have been faced with for the longest time. Thanks in advan",xhera92,I feel empty

She sat down to wait for the train and put it down.
It was about 215 pm.
She left it sitting there and didn't realize until we got to the other end.

I've lived here for a while and it's not uncommon to lose a ezlink card.

Only this one was particularly special to me.

It's a gudetama card and my older daughter bought it for me as a funny gift when she came to visit two years ago.

She's not with us anymore.

There was only $17 dollars on it and I don't care about the money.

I shouldn't have used it and gave it to her for just one trip.....but I did, and now it's gone.  She feels very badly but I I feel it's mostly my fault for allowing the card to get away from me.

Now let the discussion begin, *what's your favorite Bar from the List? Whom would you have dropped in the ranks?*

I've visited the first 5 bars and I am always a bit skeptical about these type of rankings. There's no transparency about the voting system, and there are definitely a couple of entries that baffle me.

**Manhattan** \- I really liked this place and i can see why it is this high in the ranking, if it's the BEST bar in Asia, not sure about that. Their drinks were good but nothing crazy innovative, however their atmosphere and service were impeccable and indeed one of the best I've come over in Asia. And true to the Number One spot, it's indeed tricky to get a table on the weekend.

**Atlas** \- Wow what a let down, while the interior design and atmosphere of the whole place surely is ""Grande"" and impressive when you enter for the first time, but you don't go to a Bar to look at the walls.. their drinks were a huge miss with very average Cocktails , served by anonymous personnel,  while the shear size of the place screams for mass\-handling. It's very touristy and misses any aspect of a ""good bar"", which should have a healthy mix of personal care taking of your guests, outstanding drinks in creativity and flavor and intimate interior. This place is purely for tourists, and whoever likes a good drink should definitely go somewhere else. I actually preferred this place when it still was ""Angle's Share"" back in the days.

**Tippling Club** \- Good bar, yes, Top 7 Bar in Asia? Nope! Yes this place has made a name for itself in the last years, but I personally stopped going there, because I feel that that's the exact reason their quality has gone down. It's a common problem in Singapore, as soon as your F&B place has hit any type of ""Best of List"", the service goes down, the prices go up, and the place switches their regular customers for the sure to come walk in guests due to the new publicity.

**Native** \- Yes, i would have liked to see this place higher in the ranks to be honest. This place is exactly what I believe a good, fresh bar and concept should be. Their drinks are amazingly creative in both ingredients and how they are served, it's a cozy place, not overrun, but with very good and personal service.

**28 Hong Kong Street \-** I totally don't get the hype about this place. It was probably the most generic bar I've visited out of the Top ranks in this list \(besides the one thing of not really having a shiny store front, but how much weight to you really put on being a ""speak easy"" bar, if everyone else is doing the same now\). There were actually people inside on their Laptop working \(speaking of exclusivity\), while the drinks were just like anything else I can get at the close by CQ / BQ. The personnel was even a bit snobby, again, you get that vibe ""We are always on the top lists, so be grateful we let you in here"" \(even if the place is half empty\).

The Empty Mooncake An Empty Dream. An Essay reflecting the plight of the impoverished of Singapore,47,73jnby,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/73jnby/the_empty_mooncake_an_empty_dream_an_essay/,1,2017-10-01 20:10:22,"Please note that the full essay wont be shared directly here, and instead only part of it. A link to the full one will be provided. This is because as a follow up to my essay I volunteered to raise awareness of one of the local charities to Singapore ( an altruistic volunteerism ), and I am afraid if people will deem it to be a direct promotion.

Background: I used to be under the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) when I was a student, where financial help is given to students from less privileged background in Singapore. This essay is written to reflect more regarding the plight and predicament of the impoverished of societies. 

Disclaimer: I am currently a 20 year old full time national serviceman. I won't be declaring my family's income but I would say that I am happy that I have three meals on the table, and I don't have to worry about my needs.

Context: Mooncakes are used here as they reflect the disparities in purchasing power, or ability to purchase. Empty Mooncakes are used here as they are often shunned upon and forgotten. This also reflects how the impoverished always constantly settle for something lesser, even for what that others do not desire. 

This essay is titled

""The Empty Mooncake, An Empty Dream""

Luxurious mooncakes laid in extravagant display boxes. Stores fervently vied for the divided but necessary attention of jostling customers. These consumers are nothing but earnestly keen on attaining the best treats as both gifts and for their beloved family.

This Mid-Autumn Festival was typically different from the past. New flavours and techniques were dutifully employed to aid in ensnaring the flock of customers. As usual. Alongside, one would never have noticed that the empty mooncakes were left forgotten. Nothing special, as usual. 

Such is the forgotten plight of the impoverished amongst the fast paced life of society.

Amidst the fast paced lives that society leads, the impoverished are both subconsciously and consciously outcasted to the forgotten realms. Akin to the empty mooncakes, they were deemed not worthy of attention, and perhaps even routinely forgotten year after year ( if they were remembered again ).

Society's relentless notion was that one merely spends their personal hard earned keep, and that one must work hard to succeed. It is hence not surprising but honestly shocking, that labels such as ""lazy"" and ""sloth"" are thrown upon the maligned impoverished. 

Depressingly often, we fail to materialize that we possess the much sought after precariously precious privilege. The privilege to succeed, if we work hard. That does sound clear cut and straightforward to us, no?

Yet, we neglected the crucial fact that we never should have imposed our privileged standards upon the burdened impoverished.

Having insurmountable obstacles that come wave after wave and living from paycheck to paycheck, the impoverished are stuck in a perilous cycle that serves nothing but to drain their dream for a better life. 

While we eagerly look forward to a new and better tomorrow with endless possibilities, they dread about the hurdles that reinstall in yet another torturous day.

The Full Essay is here: https://lebakeomaniac.blogspot.sg/2017/09/the-empty-mooncake-an-empty-dream-essay.html

I do sincerely thank you for dropping by. I feel that there isn't enough voice coming from the impoverished of Singapore and they are constantly forgotten. I do hope to change society's perspective to them as well, although I doubt if I have the ability to.

Thank you for dropping by and have a nice Sund",Bakeomaniac,I feel empty
PSA: Do not book coach services to Melayasia with Pacific Express & Tours pte. ltd.,201,535ucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/535ucg/psa_do_not_book_coach_services_to_melayasia_with/,29,2016-09-17 20:31:50,"I feel obligated to warn others about this company.  My wife and I booked coach passage to Malacca this past weekend.  The service provided left us late and beyond angry.  Here is why:

1. The bus from Singapore to Malacca was two hours late.  In trying to understand why, first we were told there was a traffic jam and then told the bus driver was asleep upstairs.  When asked why they did not go wake the driver the two women at the desk reaffirmed their claim about the traffic jam.  Traffic jams are OK.  Things happen.  Lying to customers is not.

2. We had to transfer buses once through immigration in Malayasia.  Us passengers were given the license plate number for the second bus - except the bus was not anywhere to be found.  After calling the office several times (they did not pick up the phone) we were told they had booked a different bus.  Once we find the bus, we ask the driver to help locate other passengers, especially those without phone service in Malayasia.  He refused.  Not wanting to spend hours waiting for passengers to find the bus, myself and another passenger ended up waiting for two hours at the exit from immigration with a sign directing our fellow passengers to the correct bus.

3. We get everyone to the bus, and there are not enough seats.  Pacific Express had overbooked.  Two passengers volunteered to ride with another bus company for the rest of the trip so we could all continue.  

4. The bus did not drop us off at the advertised location.

5. All told we arrived at Malacca around 8pm.  The bus was supposed to leave Golden Mile Complex at 8am.  Again, totally unacceptable for what should be a six hour trip.

6. I tried to get a partial refund for such embarrassing service, but the company refused.

Avoid Pacific Express and Tours at all costs when booking coach passage.  Our only consolation was the return trip; the bus was empty because most of the other passengers had re-booked with another company.  I encourage you all to pass the word to friends and family.  ",dyecoreion,I feel empty
what is the point of morning assembly?,43,4ggsuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4ggsuc/what_is_the_point_of_morning_assembly/,109,2016-04-26 18:28:47,"I'm from a school in SG that has adopted the bio metric  system of taking attendance where student scan their fingerprint once they enter school and the system will automatically take their attendance. Previously, assembly was used to take students' attendance, but now all they use it for is pledge taking and national anthem singing, I feel that all this could just be done over the PA system. During wet weather, we have assembly in our individual classrooms/ first period venues and announcements are done through the PA system. Wet weather assembly, in my opinion, saves more time. we don't waste time queuing up in our classes once the bell for assembly rings to gather, the DM doesn't have to continuously tell the student body to hush. 

i probably just sound like a whiny kid right now, but this issue has been bothering me for a long time and none of my teachers have managed to give me an answer that isn't patronizing. 

EDIT: oh i just remembered, because of the new biometric system for attendance teachers don't actually know who is present/absent at assembly. so there have been a few cases of theft from classrooms. eg: some student left her wallet in her bag and when she came back the wallet was empty that kind of stuff

His entire body and shoulder was leaning towards me with his shoulders brushing against mine!!! (personal space invaded!!!)

I don't know if it was my annoyed expression that gave me away but a guy sitting opposite me leaned forward and asked me if i wanted to switch seats with him.

Singapore Water Week is in two weeks, and I am seriously considering flying over for the networking opportunities. almost a thousand companies and firms will be present ( to sell their products and services, but I could make contacts potentially). I can afford the flight and the stay, but it is still financially a stretch. But before I buy my plane ticket, I wanted to see if there are any opinions about doing this. I also plan on applying to PUBS and a few other companies and farms beforehand to see if I can get any interviews.

Why do so many people here avoid stairs like the plague?,0,26cs6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/26cs6z/why_do_so_many_people_here_avoid_stairs_like_the/,43,2014-05-24 20:23:00,"People often stereotype North Americans as overweight and lazy, but my experience here, so far, has really made me feel Iike these stereotypes are unfair. 

Everywhere I go in SG, people here seem to do everything they can to avoid walking up a staircase. Perfectly young, healthy and able people will wait (what seems like) an eternity for an elevator to come in a busy mall (for example) just to go up or down ONE FLOOR. More often then not, a staircase or even an escalator (which in many cases would be a much faster trip) is right beside the elevator. 

Similar things happen with escalators. IMO, they shouldn't be used for laziness, but rather for time-saving; if you are perfectly able, and not exhausted, you should walk up an escalator. Secondly, please, if you are disabled, elderly or for another reason  find it difficult to walk up stairs, stay to the side so others can walk. Yes, including you couples and families. This same same logic can be applied to travelators. 

In closing, it is of personal opinion that people should be more considerate and less lazy when it comes to these machines. Give way to people who need them and be more considerate to those in need. Use the stairs! Walk up an escalator! You can not only save time and be considerate of others, but it will make you healthier! You could live longer!

Also, when I say ""people here"", I don't necessarily mean Singaporeans. I'm just saying people IN Singapore. In Canada,  people don't do these things nearly as often.. We walk up stairs and escalators. We hold the door, and yes, we say I'M SORRY a lot. So, if I've offended you in any way...

I'm sorry. 

Next time you go to an MRT station, look at the empty staircase beside the escalator and take a moment to reflect on how ridiculous that beautifully crafted set was designed. It was designed for YOU.  Reflect on yourself too... You could set an example, but honestly, you should do it for yourself. You deserve it.

For those who don't know, an accomplice in a horrible murder is forced to endlessly relive the experience of helplessness and being hunted down as penance for her crimes. I went to check the discussion boards and saw that many people seemed to think that the punishment was ""primitive and barbaric"" and that it did not achieve the aim of rehabilitating the criminal.

I understand that justice and vengeance are different concepts but I am having a hard time drawing the line in a case like this. Do prisons really rehabilitate criminals and is it a fitting punishment for ALL crimes? And I know some people around me who would be more than happy to see perpetrators of horrible crimes to be on the receiving end as part of ""justice"" as well.

So r/singapore, what's your go-to site that has none of the above-listed BS?

A recent one I've came across is [The Ordinary Patrons](https://ordinarypatrons.com/).

Why I like them:

* They pay for their own meals **all the time**. If they're invited to try a place, they do so anonymously to avoid special *blogger* treatment. Mad props for that.

* Their site has a nice and simple layout. Not excessively full of ads and annoying pop ups asking you to sign up for a newsletter
 
* Their content is frequently updated - usually few posts a w",BishyBashy,kill yourself

Dealing with Bed Bugs in Singapore - My experiences and advice,304,8oeyko,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8oeyko/dealing_with_bed_bugs_in_singapore_my_experiences/,78,2018-06-04 21:45:46,"This is a follow up to my really old post on a bed bug problem. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3dtb7h/best_bed_bug_pest_control_in_singapore/

Many singaporean redditors have messaged me questions about how I got rid of them, and what advice I have for prevention, and I figured it would be good to start a thread about it. Hopefully others have good advice.

Firstly, anyone can get bedbugs. It has nothing to do with how clean you are, all it takes is a single bed bug to hitch a ride and it can lead to infestation. So don't blame yourself for it.

However, there are steps to reduce your exposure and prevent an infestation from taking hold. Try your best not to buy used furniture, but if you do, make sure you check every nook and cranny with a bright flashlight for bedbugs. Make sure you know what they look like. They don't just live in beds - I've found them in computer chairs, under tables, on curtains, in wardrobes, and cable boxes. 

Another way of reducing your exposure is to wash your clothes in hot water after being in places with many people. In my case, I was in NS and the guard room bunks were filthy, with plenty of rotating groups of men which would increase exposure. Honestly though, unless you're in exceptional situations like this I wouldn't worry much about washing your clothes in hot water after being in a bus.

If a bedbug does unfortunately hitch a ride on your clothes, the best thing to do is early detection. I was paranoid enough to get a plain pinewood ikea bed (I even painted it white!) and switched to white bedsheets. The moment you find a brown bloodspot on your bed or frame, it's a sign of bedbugs. Don't be like me and think I just squashed a mosquito in your sleep. Bedbugs are amazing at hiding during the day, but they can't hide those bloodspots. Look at the entire bed and frame with a flashlight - if you see more bloodspots, even if you don't find a bedbug, I would immediately call a pest control company to deal with it. As tempting as it is to 'DIY' it, you simply don't have access to the heavy chemicals needed to really obliterate this pest. 

As for picking a pest control company, I went with PestMasters, but I felt that they were not professional when it came to extensively checking all corners of the room. At minimum, 2-3 fumigations are needed to destroy an infestation, so if a company offers a one time treatment don't bother. This is because the pesticide only kills the hatched bedbugs, not the eggs. The eggs must be allowed to hatch before the last generation can be killed. Treatment should be perform at 2 week intervals. 

Before the pest control arrive, make sure you check every corner of the room for bedbugs and note their locations so you can tell them where to fumigate. I wouldn't trust them entirely to know where they are - the company I worked with barely checked anything the first treatment, and I discovered plenty of bedbugs that were unaffected.

When you discover bedbugs, quarantine the room and do not move things out of the room unless they're in sealed garbage bags. If it's your bedroom, I'd put all my clothes in a garbage bag and wash it with hot water and keep my clothes outside the room. Don't move furniture out of the room.

Treatment can take weeks or even months if the infestation is bad. I've tried 3 'DIY' solutions, and I can tell you that most just don't work. Diatomaceous earth (DE) doesn't kill bedbugs (in my experience putting one in a jar of it) all it does is discourage their movement. In that way it can be useful during an infestation by preventing them from getting on your bed. I put cups of DE on the 4 feet of my bed. I've tried a product called Delta Dust by Bayer and it took 2 weeks to kill a single bedbug in a jar (not effective enough). I also tried a liquid spray you can get at hardware shops, that did kill on contact but I'm not sure how persistent it was. One product I really wanted to try was CimeXa dust, however by that point the pest control treatments had already eradicated the infestation. 

Some long term prevention advice I have is to make sure your flooring is sealed, and cracks in the walls, window corners, etc are all filled. I lived in an old house full of cracks, termite-eaten parquet, curtains with plenty of hidden bits for bedbugs to hide. If they don't have any good places to hide, treatment will be more effective. Last time I checked, gas treatments, which are very effective and used in most Western countries, are not allowed when fumigating for bedbugs here. Why? I have no clue. But it means you're limited by sprays - if it can't reach the bedbugs the infestation will persist. 

The entire process is mentally exhausting an arduous. Make sure you take care of yourself, and speak to someone if it makes you feel better. I suffered for months after with phantom bites and anxiety over bedbugs. I hope this post was informative, and it would be great if people could chime in on their own experiences and solutions that worked for them, especially if you know a good pest control company.

"[Series] Dear Kid, what is Success and what does it mean?",257,859gov,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/859gov/series_dear_kid_what_is_success_and_what_does_it/,54,2018-03-18 21:31:20,"Dear kid, 

At some point in your life, you will ask and seek answers to this question “What is the meaning of life, and how would I know I have succeeded in life? 

In true Singaporean fashion, I believed that achieving the 5Cs’ (Cash, Car, Credit Card, Condo and Country Club) was the actual gauge of “success”. 

I wanted to be rich; I wanted to live in a bigger house; I wanted to drive a sexy looking continental car; I wanted to have “elitest” credit card; I wanted to be part of a top-tier club. In short, I wanted more. 

Digging deeper into what it really means to have the 5Cs - I realized it is the desire to “win”. It is the desire to do better compared to your friends, neighbors and relatives. It is the desire to say to yourself that “Yes, I am succeeding because I am living in a bigger house, driving a nicer car compared to Mr XYZ”. 

It is ugly, yet this is the ugly truth – In your life, you will meet people who derive happiness based on relative comparison. “I have this, you don’t. Thus I’m happier and more successful than you”. 

One day you may ask me “Daddy, why can’t I get the latest toy when my friends have them? Why can’t I get the latest laptop model? Why can’t I go traveling every year when my friends do that, and they come back with awesome stories?” I am afraid to share that I too, had asked the same questions to my parents when I was young. It made me terribly unhappy when I was a kid, to see that my friends are having a better life than I did. Nonetheless, this unhappiness was exactly what I needed – to learn that the very act of comparison kills the joy of living at our own terms. 

Now that I’m older and (hopefully) wiser, these external validations of “success” did not matter as much as I thought they do. On my deathbed, I will not be thinking about these external metrics that defined my life. There will be other tangibles and intangible values that will have far more meaning than everyday objects that I can’t take to my grave. 

Well, I’m tired now and knowing that we all have short attention span these days, let’s revisit the other themes that constitute success next time.

Your Dad.

Does anyone actually pay the $50 fine to restore voting rights after not voting?,9,7r22ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7r22ca/does_anyone_actually_pay_the_50_fine_to_restore/,5,2018-01-18 08:17:11,"$50 is a significant sum of money to anyone except those who are rich enough to see $50 as chump change.

However, the statistical expectation of the impact your 1 vote is always infinitesimal. Paying the $50 fine is, by all reasonable arguments, an irrational act that goes against one's own interest. I cannot think of any logical (i.e. non-emotional and non-impulsive) reason why anyone would pay.

In the following election, 200 don't vote, including the 100 from the previous election. Is the voter turnout counted as (800/1000) = 80%, or (800/900) = 89",BreadThumper,I impulsive

"NS Down Pes E9, Bipolar Disorder, Career in Government and MNC?",20,46wh99,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/46wh99/ns_down_pes_e9_bipolar_disorder_career_in/,43,2016-02-22 10:20:48,"Just a bit about myself.


Some background
I'm currently serving in NS as a clerk.
I graduated from a local Polytechnic, high GPA, one of the top students ( received awards, distinctions etc)
Received awards from minister, and Mendaki Anugerah awardee( Yes I'm Malay)


Admitted to the Local University I wanted, NTU and into the course I wanted(Materials Engineering, Skipped a year. Taking an additional minor too.


Prior to NS, I was doing numerous free-lance jobs and external projects on my own, building websites, working for overseas companies and getting offers of that sort, made a few businesses of my own, I made a flyer business, ecommerce, investments in shares. Didn't really sleep much and felt really energetic and was working almost all the time. Joined a few High IQ societies out of boredom too and out of grandiose beliefs. [ This is reminiscent of the Manic phase in Bipolar)


Enlisted to NS Sep 2014
During National Service, I suffered from severe depression ( or so I thought), I was feeling down and I thought it was normal for everyone else too, I had all these thoughts about being a loser, not being worth anything in life and delusions of having problems girlfriend problems, financial problems, social life problems and I had trouble having any sort of cohesion with anyone, most do not like the type of conversations I usually employ and I was out-casted. 


At the same time, I felt so angry at the world, as if my issues were both projected inwards as well as outwards blaming the world. Feeling so stern inside yet having the ability to break at any point.
Due to the nature of my behaviour in camp and just lack of any confidence in myself and the fact that I couldn't pass my IPPT, flunked my Sit-test, I was posted to be a Security Trooper, my depression worsened and one day I broke down in training and started crying on the floor. I suppose my terrible vocation had a part in my depressed mood. 


I was moved out of training and was queued for MMI.
Months later, visited MMI, after several interviews and tests, I was informed I had bipolar disorder.
The usual route for Bipolar Disorder was a straight Pes F and was told it was via directive.
Of course, I declined and with the fact that they said I had a bright future, we made some agreement to circumvent it so that I can continue to serve as Pes E9


Some months later in my new vocation as a clerk, my condition worsened again, despite having down pes and being a clerk, I was still crying for months, sometimes hiding in a room, in the corner, or in the toilet. Trying not to get spotted. I attempted suicide too but failed.


Then one day, this year, I was caught in my act, a few hours later I was warded to IMH ( so now I have an IMH record) for a week.
Sent back to MMI, got so close to getting Pes F again, my parents had to beg the doctor not to let me Pes F due to the severe consequences of not serving NS. 


My condition is stable now, I take regular exercises and try to be more conscious of my thoughts, take a few supplements too. 


But the fact that my PES is E9 and my condition was for F, as well as the IMH record.
Do I still have a chance to work for a large MNC or for Government?



TLDR;
Got Good academics, Diploma and local Uni degree.
Down-Pes due to mental health
Can still work in government",Nidsan,had thoughts suicide
