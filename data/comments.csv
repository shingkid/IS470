8vgrob,e1nbokf,"I hope you don't kill yourself. Life is worth it.

I used to be in a similar place as you. Suicide attempts. depression, anxiety, worthlessness, misery, excruciating existential angst, you name it. I'm in a much better place now. Not to say ideal, but much better compared to the hell I was in.

What helped me was seeing my doctor regularly and talking things through. Don't be so quick to crap on the value of dialogue. If it's genuine, you really can use it to cut through the crap and figure out how it is you can go about fixing your life.

But perhaps the most helpful thing, or person, has been someone I don't even know. [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9QgwWCNEhDxL1gH-jxa8Q/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=p) and his ideas have really helped reshape my views about the world, about relationships and how it is one should go about living their lives. I highly recommend checking him out. I hope his ideas help you as they have helped me. 

I know it can be difficult reaching out to get help. But I promise you it really is worth it. Just take it one small step at a time. All the best. 

Also, if money is an issue to getting help, you can visit a medical social worker to get medifund which can cover up to 100% of your bills. Take care.",17,doctorwhybother98,2018-07-03 00:49:52,8vgrob

They will also provide follow-ups so it’s not a once off service. I believe that they should be able to help in moments of crisis.

8vgrob,e1nfsx2,"hey man, not sure if you know this but if you commit suicide and failed aka you survive, you are likely to be arrested coz it's considered and illegal act. if you succeeded in committing suicide aka you died, someone has to pay for your funeral expenses which are likely to be in the tens thousands. Are you that cruel enough to let someone else shoulder your funeral expenses?

life sucks rn, but it's only a temporary phase. i know it is kinda hypocritical of me to say this since i'm struggling with the thoughts of death every day, but it all boils down to how you perceive life when obstacles hit you hard. i have lost 2 friends to suicide from depression and had my savings wiped clean by my parents, and my heart is broken as hell because of these, but i still hang on in life because there's no point dwelling about it since what's done has already been done and the only salvation is thinking about what i can do right now to change my future. Study harder for As to get into local uni? Probably, as long as i don't go crazy by the end of this A levels journey.

I'm not asking you to go back to school right now since it's not feasible for your current income bracket, but as long as you save diligently, you should be able to see your money grow. The growth may not be fast since you need to pay bills and all, but it will grow. While the money is growing however, take some time to have a date with yourself. Not like those expensive lunch dinner dates, but like take a walk around the country when you have the time to. Walk around nature parks like Botanic Gardens, challenge yourself to walk the entire park from the cluny court entrance to the bukit timah exit, or hike the bukit timah hill or walk the macritchie trail. You don't need expensive hiking equipment to do these things, just walk around with an open mind and appreciate how you are here, at this moment, breathing air and feeling the wind and sunlight against your skin. You can even explore your neighbourhood, walk from one street to another.

Living is painful, yes, but it is ultimately up to you to make the best of it. ~~If you do end up committing suicide, chances are you are just gonna end up as another hidden figure in the government's archives~~

8vgrob,e1ngkuf,"Just live each day as it comes. As much as you can, don't fuss over what will happen. If you starve, you starve. if you die, you die. if you decide to commit suicide eventually, so be it. Or Life could take a turn for the better and you look back on this period as one that deepened and matured you as a person.

I found myself in bad places in the past many times, and every now and then still do. I've read a lot of spiritual teachings to understand and free myself from the pain but it is an ongoing process and i don't know when i will be completely free. In the end, Life will take you where it must. 

In NS, i went to the MO for depression, but when I got posted out to a different unit which had a much better environment, my depression went away. I told the MO what happened, that the different environment made me feel much better. There was nothing I did, and the unit I was posted out to was actually relatively 'small' (a HQ unit with mostly regulars and a small NSF personnel pool) and I just happened to get extremely 'lucky' that I was posted there. Life just brought me in a bad place and then brought me out. But the MO said i should take some credit for dealing with my depression which was rubbish since I did nothing.

8vgrob,e22184h,"Hey, man. I read your entire story and it sounds almost like mine! Except I had to deal with an abusive gambling addict mother, not a father. Like you, I am also a 31 year old single this year and merely a diploma holder.

Just a little context and share my recovery story: I was just like you. I had an abusive mother who would both emotionally and physically abuse me since childhood and stole all my wages to fund her gambling habit. She was declared a bankrupt and I had to pay her debts despite only earning $1500/mo. My father passed away from lung cancer after, I was also on the verge of killing myself from the painful grief and stress.

One day, with only $1000 in my name, I made the toughest choice to break away from my mother. When she was out, I packed my things, ran away from home and never looked back again. My life did get better but it was still tough as my rent was $800 a month and I was eating so little. I was only earning $1300-$1700/mo as a customer service officer.

I was also wasting my life away at games because I was so depressed, anxiety-ridden. I felt like I ruined my entire twenties. I also suffered from chronic nightmares of my mother hurting me over and over.

One day, I was self-reflecting, feeling I was very abnormal from others. I wanted to be happy. So I made the decision to go to Geylang Polyclinic and got a referral at Geylang Psychiatric Wellness clinic. I was ready to pay a huge sum of money to ""fix myself"" mentally but to my surprise, my bills were only $50. My psychiatrist assessed that I had PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and it has been affecting my whole life. After going through therapy and put on prozac, I felt functioning and decided it was time to improve my life and find solutions to my rut.

My first decision for improvement and to recover was to stop thinking myself as inferior. So I quit my job and took up a better paying tech support job to sustain my rent.

Next, I applied to Singapore University of Social Sciences for a degree so I can get better paud and upgrade. Their part-time degrees do not require you to attend all classes and it's not compulsory to attend lectures. You can still learn everything completely online on their Canvas learning portal if you're too busy to go to classes. The school is also government subsidized, you can get grants and loans for it.

Next, to fulfill myself emotionally, I started volunteering at charity organizations, helping elderly, children with disabilities, other PTSD patients like me and befriending ex-convicts. It felt like a rewarding experience because I got to know many friends and also great social workers who vouched for me in my scholarship application.

I know you hate social workers and had bad experiences with them. I am truly sorry to hear that. Times have changed, however. I have met many wonderful social workers who have given me advice and assistance I needed. Like you, I am single, 31 years old, not earning much, also hope to buy my own HDB flat at 35. I still lament over my financial situation and my rent and debts but I felt like I took great steps in improving my situation by taking a degree in SUSS, getting therapy and doing volunteering work. I hope to make a career switch to social work myself as I saw a calling to help others like you and me.

I know it's easier to say than to do when people tell you not to give up. I'm not gonna give you any advice because I don't know your experiences too well to offer concrete solutions but I empathize with you greatly, hence I'm here to share my story as a living proof that healing and recovering from such a terrible rut is possible. It's going to be tough and shitty but I know you can be capable of it. From I have read from your story, you seem like a strong, intelligent person.

Please don't think of killing yourself. You are a valued person and I hope you find the strength to survive this.",1,Silver1legs,2018-07-10 04:56:53,8vgrob

2. You can talk to your GP. They're bound by confidentiality so you again don't have to worry about anyone finding out. They'll be able to refer you to perhaps the Institue of Mental Health or other qualified professionals. 

3. Engage with people having the same problem. It's great that you joined nofap but perhaps you could engage with a few people individually. So maybe you can find comfort in the fact that they're also struggling with the same thing. Try talking about it with someone you trust which I know is hard for you.But in the end I'm sure if you talk to someone from your family they might be a bit put off but they'll definitely support you in the end.

I highly recommend for one to seek help if needed. You are not alone.

",15,tiaph,2014-12-22 02:15:07,2pygf4
2pygf4,cn18e2z,"As someone who works in the fields of mental health i would have the following advice...

If you feel you are strong enough to get through this without the help of medication i would definitely recommend you do so. Anti depressants have their place and value but are often seen as a first response to mental illness as opposed to a last resort which i feel they should be. Going onto anti-depressants so early in life can result in this being your coping strategy as opposed to learning and developing your own. Periods of depression can often be overcome with therapy. 
Identifying triggers of poor mental health (stress/change/loss) and identifying patterns/loops of negative thoughts can often be the best way to move away from a cycle of depression and through gained understanding allow us to break such cycles and move beyond them. Reflection upon the positives you have in life and using your personal strengths to overcome personal difficulties is, in my opinion, the best help and therapy to break a period of depression. Regaining ownership over your own health can be the most empowering experience in someone's life and can work towards rebuilding confidence, self esteem and a trust in your self that can often be lost during times of depression. 
Remember the things you love to do. The things that once gave meaning and value to your day and try to reconnect with them. Make graded small steps towards connecting again with your routine and your identity. It may be something relatively small like leaving the house to go for something nice to eat. Calling a trusted friend. Visiting the cinema or if this is too difficult inviting a friend to watch a film at your home. The more you withdraw from your routine the greater your feelings of loss/hopelessness will increase. 
I would also say to you that one of the greatest strengths we have in this life are our connections with other people and the ones we love. Our support networks are what keep us all connected and strong. Hiding even from those you trust is a difficult path to go down. It is tiring and damaging to your sense of self, identity and self confidence. Self-esteem can never grow when hiding parts of yourself as that can only result in shame and guilt. Powerful and damaging emotions. 

Through all of this remember who you are, embrace the good and beauty around you, do not recognise shame or fear because we are all human and all face hardships in our lives. Do not be quick to assume you are alone because trust me, you are not.

Good luck on your journey. ",12,mrq1989,2014-12-22 03:39:39,2pygf4

2pygf4,cn17zen,"Hi op. If you're worried about costs,  I can shed some light on IMH. I was warded there for about two weeks, and it cost me... I think around 600-800? Can't remember the figure. That Sum was entirely paid by Medisave. C class ward. For follow up appointments,  each one costs me between 40-60$ depending on medication etc. If you are having trouble paying,  the staff there are more than willing to help. You can speak to a medical social worker to see what your options are. 

I ask that you seek help from a professional. I won't say it will help,  however there's always the change that it might. That alone makes the cost worth it. 

Feel free to ask me more if you have any questions. ",2,mwolfee,2014-12-22 02:56:32,2pygf4
2pygf4,cn1t9ao,There are psychiatric departments in public hospitals that are not imh. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and counsellor at ktph for years now and i can honestly say theyre better than the private ones I saw. They're not desperate to ply me with medicine to earn their commission and they actually let me choose what medicine is best for me and how much I want. And if you see them about once in two weeks its really not that expensive. About $50 a visit for counselling and $30 to see the psychiatrist. You can get counselling at your uni so you'd only be paying to see the psychiatrist and for medicine. Probably about once a month is enough to adjust medication and get excuse letters and stuff. ,2,,2014-12-22 17:42:02,2pygf4

Subsidised rate at IMH is $30+ a session before medication, and at 1 appointment per month, that's really not bad at all. There is a waiting time for an appointment though, which you can shortcut immediately by going to the emergency room and paying $100 to get seen right away (which is ok considering that's how much you would pay by going to a private doc anyway) and subsequently your appointments would be in 1-month intervals like usual.

Yes, the word ""depressed"" has been overused by many people, but if we do not take the words of the people who said that they are depressed seriously, and if they *truly* are depressed, this might just be their last call for help before doing something to hurt themselves or to give up on life entirely. 

Most people who have friends or family members that have attempted/committed suicide were shocked because they did not pay attention/take note of the minor details like this as a cry for help. Some depressed people show no outward signs of depression at all. 

In summary, I would rather have my time wasted by a prankster than ignore anyone who says they're depressed and has asked for help. Better be safe than sorry. Every life is precious.

2pygf4,cn18r9e,"Do note that on top of govt subsidies by seeing doctors at IMH/ as a subsidized patient, you can also opt to use medisave to pay for your bills as well if you're diagnosed with major depression. 

You just need your psychiatrist to sign a form for you, stating your diagnosis. So when you register to see a doctor, you will have to tell the receptionist that you're going to use medisave to pay so they can make the necessary deductions. 

So the payment will go like this: you have to pay the first $30 and 15% of the total bill. So if the bill to see a doctor costs $100, you'll have to pay $30 + $15 = $45. This is subjected to a cap of $400/year and you can use the medisave of up to 10 different family members. Things that includes inside this payment would be things like consultations, medications, laboratory investigations etc.

2pygf4,cn2azu5,"Oh c'mon. The only other topic I ever commented on that was even vaguely related was the one on NS and mental illness. And I don't think I made a wrong statement when I said that you'll have problems finding a job in Singapore when you did not serve NS on the basis of mental illness. You should know better than anyone that there's a huge stigma on people with mental illnesses in the workplace if you've brought up your depression in an interview or during the HR/insurance coverage talk before.

I do admit I may have phrased the original comment in this thread badly. From what I'm reading though, you're suggesting that since I can't be empathetic according to your definition, I should just do nothing at all. That's not very constructive criticism, but ok.

Lastly, I do know about the physiological causes of depression. I took a course on abnormal psych a couple of years back. I also suffer very serious insomnia, caused by guess what? A failure to regulate my own neurotransmitter production, so while I don't understand what it's like to be depressed, I understand pretty well you cannot ""will"" yourself to sleep like you can ""will"" yourself out of depression.

To be perfectly and brutally honest, your comment felt extremely condescending and presumptuous, perhaps because you feel that you can empathize ""more"" with OP than me. Yes, you probably can. Am I suggesting OP try harder to get of depression? No. But you should know as well as I that depression cannot be self diagnosed. It takes a trained professional. Your claim is that I should err on the side of safety, no, I think that's a terrible mindset to take because of our culture of medicalization of illnesses. Imagine if every psychologist erred on the side of safety, we'd have a nation of children diagnosed with ADHD like America. 

OP has been pointed out to a bunch of resources (if you read the comments) that he knows about and refuses to use, which makes me think that there's the possibility that he's **not** depressed (not ruling out the possibility that he is), which is why I offered to talk and find out a little more about his situation.

I don't know if you're biased against me after reading that NS post but I really think you shouldn't make assumptions about others and their motivations from a single post (which I still maintain is true, if you deny the stigmatization of mental illness in Singapore as a reality, something is very wrong with you).",1,dashrandom,2014-12-23 08:45:34,cn29ep3

If you had reacted angrily each time, would you have made anyone reconsider their opinion and become more accepting of homosexuality? I doubt it. More than likely you would have just created really awkward situations.

If you want to make a genuine impact, don't create drama through actions such as walking away in a huff or starting a campaign that is doomed to failure. Dramatic actions make you feel like you're contributing, when mostly you are making yourself look emotionally unstable and socially inept.

If your colleagues have particular views you disagree with, but are otherwise decent people, you can try making a genuine impact one conversation at a time. If they're toxic through and through, it may be best to simply keep your distance.

Is there no middle ground? Isn't it possible for you to perhaps pull one or two of those that you respect aside and are closer to and just voice out in a VERY tactful manner that you feel uncomfortable about the way they joke and disrespect homosexuals and that it hurts to hear what they say as you have people whom you care abt that are in the LGBT community?

People deal with it two ways - they either take it back or they go all ""y so srs?"". Where I am people usually take it back, and then launch into a discussion about why it's offensive. I use that opportunity to explain. I try to remain calm, because somehow being emotional about things reads as irrational, and people think irrationality is uncredible or something stupid like that, but I digress.

When people go ""y so srs"" or ""just a joke, come on"" or other ""politically correct"" bullshit, I get mad. I try not to get mad, but I try to get the point across that your (their) words mean more than ""just a joke"". I'm all for collegiality and shit, but people can have a good time without putting other people down. The words, terms, and jokes they use so easily (eg. ""that's so gay"", ""retard"", etc) are an indication of how they really feel about such things. It might help to say something like, ""is this how you really feel about gay people?""

I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I have to admit I try to make people feel stupid for making derogatory remarks, and I do this for a lot of things, like homosexual remarks, sexist remarks, racist shit, and yes, even saying things like ""retard"". Why? Because if they knew better, they wouldn't make such ignorant remarks. So I try to come at it from an educational standpoint.

Will I become a social pariah in certain situations for standing up for my beliefs? Sure. But I don't *need* these ignorant jerks in my life.

It's not violent, but with exposures comes understanding to confrontations, sometimes it's alright to communicate through the fist and sometimes that's how friends are made ->>>> That's seen in asian movies.

Asians, and Singaporean unfortunately grown up playing individual sports, it's what popular and what wins these countries medals.  Because of space history culture or what not we don't devote resources towards contact sports.  And like any education system it demonstrates itself into the adulthood.  It shows the way Asian loves to communicate - by being subtle, on point, avoid direct confrontation yet loves to talk behind the back.  The environment trained us for mind games and we are pretty good at it, but the process demonized confrontations and in your case, just simply standing up for yourself.

I say this because I understand the type of catch22 you are dealing with.  Sorry dude, you need to make a stand and it's going to be risky either way.  But confrontation is just as right and wrong to being passive if you can get rid of that chain of stigma preventing you from doing so - it's just an action and not an identity.  Gandi is just as right as he is wrong, he will always be part of history not for just for his stern stance on principles but a reminder to his descendants about the applicability itself - ""Timing"". 

Get buff, be strong, next time someone annoys you tell them to politely stfu or you'll give him a good physical reminder. You might lose some friends along the way, but it's either that or you can deal with these asshole for the next 80 years in your life. ",1,BrothaTom,2015-05-10 09:13:08,2rmxjc

17zs3x,c8aaod1,"TL:DR (From Mr Singh himself!)

1. Slow down immigration and focus on resolving all issue related to the past population boom.

2. We can live with a slightly slower growth (not zero or slow growth) and hence moderate dependence on foreigners.

3. Use the Dubai model to complement our local workforce with foreign workforce, but don’t grant them PRs – ie a transient workforce.

4. Abandon the 6.9m figure by 2030, this will be another rapid growth which we cannot handle.

5. Solve Singaporeans problems first and also don’t give PRs same privileges as citizens.

PR (foreign citizen) should not even be part of it. In my opinion, the solution is to have PR as temporary status. 10-15 yrs. After that he/she must choose either become a citizen, or an employment pass holder.Same thing with PR boys. By age 21, he needs to say the oath, and then have obligation to serve NS, or permanently discharge from the PR status.

This is waay too naive for a member of parliament. - his story about new citizen from china who can buy luxurious property, and why his fellow singaporeans can't.This is just plain emotional statement with no basis; next time sir, please compare tycoon to tycoon, factory worker to factory worker.

Again he is being naive here. 80ies-early 90ies is an end/peak of a golden era of economy. Everybody have it easy during that time. In US, Europe, even developed countries like india n indonesia, all college graduates can afford standard housing and a car/motorbike, but to be fair, how many college graduate are there in the 80ies? now world changes, Now competition is fierce, each person you met in the mrt is a college graduate. So yes, this current generation singaporeans (actually the whole world) have is tougher than before. The question is what to do about it? His solution is (what I understand anyway) To overprotect them. Protect them from outside competition. I don't think its a good idea. singapore has only 1 resource: human resource. I say, focus in better education ( which actually the current gahmen is quite good at, we have lots of new international quality schools like SUTD, SOTA..

I can relate and fit in to Singaporean society very easily because of my interests and have already made Singaporean friends while still being in India because of it.

What irritates me is seeing people (not just from India) ready and willing - quite desperately - to get into Singapore by any means necessary. That includes working for below par salaries and even taking up *any* education course as a gateway to hopefully stay longer once they graduate. Meaning, they're not even studying for the sake of their own well-being. Then they try really hard to apply for PR status as soon as they are eligible and begin the process of bringing their entire family over. Because they already decided they have no intention of going back to their country of origin.

In the past one-and-half years that I've been researching on Singapore and looking for a job, I have come across many such instances in various forums and discussions that cement the above facts and it irritates that I may very well be clubbed under the same.

True, but as of now I'm dead certain about my plans. Once I'm done travelling Asia, I will move on to Europe and so forth. In the summer of 2014, I will be in Brazil for the World Cup and I'm already saving up for that. If you must know my future plans.

But I stand by whatever else I said. The first mistake I made is assuming salaries in Singapore match the high cost of living there. When I assumed SG$5000-7000 p.m. salaries would be fairly common for someone with 8 years of MNC work experience (i.e, me) it was disappointing to know most relevant jobs openings I came across were in the $2500-$4000 mark, especially those that weren't strictly for Singaporean or PRs only. 

Companies in Singapore can get away with it because even in that range, they have enough candidates from all around the world - desperate to get in - who are ready and willing to apply. I know for sure my chances would improve if I was willing to work for less, but I choose not to, because I'm not desperate to be in Singapore. Singapore is the number one choice; but by default, when it comes to working in SE Asia, most good jobs *are* in Singapore.

About the job. Singapore is a dynamic work environment. With even locals being replaced quite fiercely. Companies are primarily here for tax purposes. Government services are great and likely best in the world at a very low tax rate. But it's not a protectionist government. And corporations moving here, are not here because Singapore is a great place to live. It is, but that's like icing on the cake.

Not sure how you are approaching job hunting. Let me suggest to you that it be more pragmatic to get a job in one of the satellite offices and push your boss for move to Singapore after a while.

If I remember it correctly, it was a Friday when they announced over the intercom that ""name"" had passed away in an unfortunate incident and that the counsellors office was open to anyone who needed it. 

It was jarring to say the least. Everyone was talking about it after class, they said it was an ""incident"", but we all know what really happened. There was a solemn atmosphere in the whole school. I didn't know him personally but he was supposed to be in my Chinese class; I know because I see his name covered by correction tape on the class list. I think about him whenever I look at it. 

One of my classmates was the guys best friend, he was devastated. He tried to keep himself together when they announced it but from what I heard, he broke down with a bunch of other friends. 

Like I said, I didn't know him personally but I almost cried when I heard the announcement. It's just sad. We were 16, we had our whole lives ahead of us, to hear that one of our peers didn't get to live out his life was just... sad.

From the comments i've seen, you guys are the reason why nobody seeks help for mental health. Any attempt to breach the subject would be met with either condescending ""get over it"" remarks, as if one has a flu one day and gets well after a day in bed, or the ""if you say that again, i will slap you"" from parents, or even the alarmist action of calling the police. This is why i found difficulty seeking help, the stigma of owning up to mental disorder.

Depression isn't a joke, neither does it come to one as an enlightened idea. You speak as if its a plan a 5 year old formuated to get a parent's attention.

It strikes incredibly close to home, because I also recently just came out to my homophobic Christian father and stepmother (my mother and stepfather are Buddhists/free thinkers and have known since I was 18). I grew up with my father constantly voicing his opinion on homosexuality whenever it came up on television, so I knew I would never be able to come out until I had financial independence as well since he was paying for me through university.

When I came out, I cried after I said the very first sentence. And the tears could not stop because it was so cathartic to finally be telling them who I really was as a person after hiding it from them for 15 years (I've known I was homosexual since mid-primary school). And the only things he could say was ""why?"" and ""if I had known early, I could have done something"". And I lost it. I laughed and asked what he could have done to me. Beat me? Send me for ""correction therapy""? And I said the exact same things you thought. If I could choose, as if I would choose this? As if I would choose to have to look at my father and see the disappointment in his face and know that I will never be able to bring my girlfriend home like others can.

But things ended up reasonably well too. I didn't get slapped like I expected, I didn't get disowned straight away. He said ""I'm not happy with your choices, but you are still my daughter"", and in that moment I thanked God because that was the best possible outcome I hoped and prayed every day of my life for. But many of my friends are not in the same position and it kills me every time they speak of it because I was in their shoes just a month ago.

2. There is a separation of church and state  

Even if religious people refuse to admit (1), (2) remains independently true.

There is no cogent, non-homophobic response against this; all appeals are fear-mongering, or completely irrational, or slippery slopes.

This was maybe around a decade ago now, but I will never forget those words. Same with my dad, who was watching TV when he suddenly told me that ""gay people are unnatural"", but he followed that by telling me he thinks that ""killing them is a bit too much"" in such an indifferent tone you would think he was talking about animals on a farm. 

At that time I had been struggling with my sexuality for years and her words really cut me very deeply like a knife. I'm 23 and comfortable with my bisexuality now, but it took me 15 years of struggling to properly come out to myself. Those words still come and haunt me sometimes, but I try to tell myself that my own validation is all that matters. 


The thing is that none of them are very religious (my mum is kinda a believer but she's not very hardcore) and their homo/bi/transphobia really stems from what they see as ""societal values"" and ""asian values"" they see as guidance for their moral compasses. You are right, 377A is not ""just a symbol"", but is symbolically violent and discriminatory. It's a tool to justify hurtful, terrible views.  

I do LGBTQ+ related research as a graduate student, and my parents are usually quite embarrassed to talk to others about what I do. That doesn't bother me as much, though. Still not out to my parents, my family (except for my sister), and a lot of close friends. I have a lot of Christian/Catholic friends, so I'm just terrified of coming out to anyone in case I have no friends left haha. Last time I tried to test the waters with two of my friends and they told me they were afraid I was going to ""fall in love with them"" and they told me to ""stay away from them"". Of course we are no longer friends haha.

This is why it’s important to keep pushing religion back into the closet where it belongs. Religion is a private lifestyle choice that has no place in a compassionate enlightened. The OP just provided evidence of the evil nature of religion. ",13,Pope-Fluffy-Bunny,2018-09-24 05:47:29,9i530c

I've been having an argument in a youtube comment section where I find they keep pulling out *""if you ask for help, we can help you""* or *I won't argue with you if all you are going to do is insult me""* which annoyed me to no end because I purposely word my responses in as polite a tone as possible because I know precisely what they'll say.

9i530c,e6h8qzy,"playing the devil's advocate, I do think your parents still have a hard time accepting you and the LGBT community, since they have been brought up around an environment which shuns and do not understand them. I imagine this is the case for many of those who are opposing the repeal of 377A, but to also blame the government for not stepping up might not be productive. I do not think the govt wants to open up a can of worms by forcing a policy (and essentially a viewpoint) that a large community does not share.    
Nevertheless, I do think LGBTs are increasingly being understood and accepted in Singapore. However, while I do support the repeal of 377A and personally have a few gay friends myself, I think the action of repeal is quite extreme. Inciting change has always been a slow process, by changing the perspective of those on the fence and bringing them to your side. Extreme actions (viewed by the other side of the fence) are in fact more likely to push people away from your agenda.    
e.g. imagine peoples personality and values as a logic tree, with some fundamental belief as a starting point; beliefs and values are built upon the fundamentals before it, and so on. The entire tree would represent a persons personality, values and beliefs. For a religious man brought up in a religious family, God and anti-LGBT beliefs would sit quite deeply in this tree. Breaking down and changing this belief would mean to change the rest of the beliefs he has built upon this particular value; needless to say it won't be easy. Alternatively, an atheist with exposure to Western media would have anti-LGBT values more towards the edge of the tree away from the starting point, and would be easier to sway this belief.

The most fucked up thing is the amount of hate and fear-mongering coming from 377A supporters. The issue would be simpler if they kept to themselves instead of asserting their views onto others. Its ok if someone hates or gets offended by something, but they are not entitled to assert their opinion onto others. 

My view on this is cynical, but part of it is to be expected in our conservative society where the amount of narrow-minded idiots is rather high.

I'm very thick-skinned when it comes to this, but what I feel is important for us as individuals is for us to be ourselves regardless of what society and those around us say or think, even if it means sacrificing  some things. Individuality is one of the most important things we have, and should not be discarded or changed, especially in a society that wants us to change for it.

Your writing is eloquent and you clearly have much depth of thought. I admire that.

If I knew you in real life I can assure you I would treat you the same as I treat anyone, in the way the Jesus loves everyone too. You’ve been to church. You know that Jesus doesn’t hate on people. So don’t let the rude comments of other christians let you think that all christians condemn and hate the LGBTQ community. They are just confused -  “this is something that goes against my belief, I don’t know what to do so I’ll just repel it with all my might,” all the while forgetting that they’re dealing with actual human lives. It’s hurtful and not representative of the christian faith.

Right now, there is evidently a lot of resistance against 377A. A large number of groups such as churches have formed that have became echo chambers that cannot be reasoned with. No amount of pleading will get through to them, no amounts of factual information will change their minds. Because facts don't matter, feelings do. Yet these groups hold influence over massive numbers of loyal followers(voters), as well as the government due to SG's religion stance.

I have gay friends and I respect their sexuality. I do not, however, support the repealing 377A. There’s no reason for it not to remain status quo especially since the authorities are not actively enforcing it. 

If there are reports that religious zealots are knocking down motel doors to catch homosexuals in the act and calling the authorities, thus forcing them to enforce it, then yes, repeal it. 

All I have read is that repealing 377A will be symbolic, and yes, it damn well will be. Supporters of the LGBT community will gather and celebrate the “legality” of their community.

That being said, OP highlights a cultural misunderstanding and unfamiliarity Singaporeans have towards LGBT issues and thus results in a fear of the unknown. Regardless of whether 377A existed in the first place or what happens to 377A, Singaporeans will continue to have doubts about LGBT issues.

9i530c,e6hbcca,"Hey. No worries. It's obviously not a statement that's awful at first glance. But at least to me, it is an extension of the idea of homosexuality is a choice or an action.

Take for example stealing. Stealing is considered wrong. But even if you caught your son stealing from the grocery store, the idea the church preaches is that you can look past what he did can still love him as a son.

The problem here is that if you believe that if you're gay, for example, you're told that liking other boys is wrong. You end up kissing a boy one Saturday night, and feeling guilty about it at church the next day. 

But the church tells you that it's OK. You made a mistake, but we still love you! We can look past your misgivings, just as long as you try harder to resist your homosexual urges next time! 

You look around you and everyone gives you the impression that it's possible. You don't see any gay person in the church, do you? So you try again. 

You try dating a girl. It fails because you see no attraction in her. You lock eyes for too long with a cute guy in the changing room. You feel guilty about it. You end up making out again on Saturday night and end up sitting back at the pew in church the next day. Now you feel horrible inside. It was just one week and you failed at controlling your homosexual urges. 

Have you ever had those days where you feel like you're screwing up and nothing goes right? If you're gay and you believe that you shouldn't act on it, so to speak, life after puberty feels like a series of mistakes over and over. And it's *your* fault! *You* weren't disciplined! *You* made the wrong choices over and over and over! In the church, you see only straight, happy families around you. There are no gays, they are unnatural! They don't exist!

You start to wonder to yourself again... *""Am I not good enough? Am I not disciplined enough?""*

*""... what the fuck is wrong with me?""*

Which is why it does sound innocent at first, but like I said, the phrase together with the words ""choice"" are a thousand little cuts to your self esteem. When you can't separate your sexuality and your existence and are told that homosexuality is a sin, a defect, you start feeling like *you're the defect*. Brood on it too long, and you start feeling resentment and disgust for yourself. You don't think you *deserve to exist.* I know because I've been there and done that.

9i530c,e6ld6gk,"Lesbians actually have the lowest rate of HIV transmission compared to gay men and straight people, so this isn't a homosexuality issue per se. It's about who has the virus and who that person is having sex with, and for how long (because there's a period of higher contagion). In the context of casual sex, if a single gay man has HIV and spreads it to another gay man, that man would then spread it further to other gay men and thus have the virus propagate within the community; vs if a straight man has HIV and spreads it to a straight woman, who may spread it to another man but not to another woman - which halves the potential infections and ensures it can't spread as fast.

Africa is one place where this model doesn't apply. Over there, the highest rates of HIV are actually among straight married women. It's common and socially accepted there for men to have both wives and girlfriends whom they're actively having sex with - so one guy might pass HIV to his wife, who passes it to her boyfriend the next day, who passes it to his other girlfriend, and so on, which leads to extremely rapid spreading of the virus, including to people who have only had sex with one other person in their life.",1,anakinmcfly,2018-09-25 20:20:05,e6iy8ad

* Discrimination against males only

Noticed that female-on-female consensual activities are not criminalised? There you have it.

* 377A *is* bad law

The government cannot reasonably claim that it does not actively enforce/turns a blind eye on 377A. A private individual can make a police report on a male-male couple based on 377A, and the police will have to investigate or this would undermine the rule of law (in this situation 377A is still law). 

Sure, the police and AGC may decide to issue a stern warning instead, but that in itself is still a finding that the offence is made out and proven beyond reasonable doubt, just that they have decided not to prosecute in court.

* Provenance of 377A

377A descends from the colonial era when laws were being written for the Straits Settlements, and derives from both the English legal system and the Indian Penal Code (through the original s377 of the Indian PC).

Since times have changed and Singapore is now supposedly a secular, independent state, laws have been repealed when they were considered irrelevant to the contemporary context - anal and oral sex were once criminalised in the original s377 as sexual activities ""against the order of nature"" but were taken off the books circa 2007. So why are we still keeping 377A?

I've been a Christian all my life, but support the repeal of 377a. (Of course, being democratic, the public should first be consulted and their views considered)

I believe that we all are influenced by a combination of 'nature' and 'nurture'. But the fact that one can be born with homosexual tendencies/preferences does not mean the act cannot be separated from the person. Just like how some people are more predisposed to violence or exploitative behaviours, or it would be unfair and incorrect to not separate their tendencies from the individual. This separation is widely subscribed to, not least by social scientists on many issues besides homosexuality.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misrepresentation and generalisation of religion in this sub (the original post, while just and reasonable, also contains these), which spawn anti-religious comments, many of which are simple untrue. Many of us don't believe that homosexuality in itself will send people to hell. Many of us are not blind to science and human rights. And most of us certainly don't see 377a as 'flag to rally supporters for religious rights'. Yes there is vocal Christian opposition to the repeal, but the vocal should not be mistaken for the majority nor their attitudes and views seen as representative of religion or it's people.

I really hope the 377 issue does not become a religion vs 'others' divide. It's convenient and it feels good, but it does no one any favours because all it leads to is misinformation and unfounded hatred. If 'real damage to society' is what you truly wish to avoid, it's best to thread this carefully.

First things first, I need to mention that the implications of 377A fall into 2 categories: legal, and social. While I very much agree that 377A does carry some horrible social implications (like the ones that OP along with many others have mentioned) and thus am on board with its repeal, the legal implications, on the other hand, are practically non-existent. When have you ever heard 377A being enforced? In the one case ever where two gay men were caught having sex in public, 377A wasn't even used. The charge was instead substituted with 294A which simply criminalises obscene acts in public.

I'm not saying that just because it's not enforced means we don't need to repeal it.

I know you think 377A is injustice and you are probably right. But the religion groups aren't arguing based on justice, they are arguing based on their personal beliefs and feelings about the matter. Your factual assessment of the lack of justice will never get through to them. They are talking on a different wavelength.

I mentioned that I think removal of 377A is inevitable. Just not quite yet because SG is one of the places with significant resistance and change needs to happen gradually. You can't rush it and expect it to work, unless something really big happens, such as a switch in the ruling party.

These people need to drop their religious biases, admit they were wrong and warmup to accepting new ideas. It's a gradual process that is very personal and cannot be rushed. Demonising and insulting them will only strengthen the ""us vs them"" mentality, and is counterproductive to change and acceptance.

In Australia, we even see these groups making their move on children in the form of the Safe School project. Outwardly it was hailed as a project to ‘protect LGBT children’ but dig deeper, it’s an indoctrination campaign

Second, I took the effort to read through his paper. One thing: the research about identical twins and their genetics make-up was not conducted by him at all. He made several claims, sometimes inference, by reading through other people's works on identical twins (that do not have homosexuality as its main thesis) and claiming that it supports his thesis. Many of his claims and proposals in the paper are not backed up by empirical data. 

Third, statements such as the following are made in the paper: ""Perhaps your son or daughter is gay. Probably its origin had nothing to do with you. But you may be blaming yourself, or others may be blaming you when its roots really lie in major misperceptions of events, and some resolution may be possible.""

ELI5: when the mother is pregnant with a son, the son will have male-specific proteins released into the bloodstream that is exchanged between the blood of both mother and son. as this is foreign to the mother's body system, the immune system develops a reaction to it to neutralize the foreign protein. with each son the mother bears, her immunity against this grows stronger. what this means for the child: later born sons have suppressed effect of this male-specific protein. this is theorized to affect the brain development of subsequent sons. Although this study provides scientific evidence linking homosexuality and developmental biology, this only forms a small portion of the entire puzzle.

9i530c,e6i8qn5,"I can understand your point but it also strays far away from the argument of 377A.

You state that there is a tangible negative effect. This doesn’t make sense because even if you repeal it, those that are against the LGBT community are not suddenly going to be more accepting of it as even from OP’s perspective, it is clear that those that are against LGBT lifestyle aren’t doing so because the government tells them to but because of their own backgrounds and understandings.

When you mention civil liberties, we can assume things like marriage and not being prosecuted but as many have already said, it is not a law that is enforced and there is no evidence that suggests that once 377A is repealed, new laws will be added to give similar rights to LGBT folk that heterosexual people have(which is why people say 377A is symbolic in the first place).

But ignoring that, what is your definition of civil liberties? What exactly are they being denied under the constitution? Again, things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution. If you mention things like protection from hate speech then you should also understand that by definition they are technically still given that liberty. ( You can read what rights are protected and what exceptions there are here https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=pr9-,pr10-,pr11-,pr12-,pr13-,pr14-,pr15-).

The government has no responsibility to protect the LGBT community from religious individuals as they have every right to speak out as it is part of their doctrine not to accept homosexual acts just as how pro-LGBT individuals are free to criticise their opinions.

The idea that we should protect all minorities while good-natured is impossible. We see this in EU countries that either have strong opposition towards letting in refugees, have opposition groups against pro-refugee policies or have policies to better help transition of refugees due to the difference in cultures. Similarly, the LGBT lifestyle runs against the lifestyle of the majority and thus, it is fair to have opposition against it.

Now, you might say that there is nothing wrong with the LGBT lifestyle but that isn’t the point. Tl;dr Under the constitution, they have the same rights and as mentioned before, 377A isn’t enforced.

And I wouldn't want to point fingers about the origin of the moral benchmark, but according to the Divine Command Theory, it was actually decided upon by religion. If we unravel the long story, there are two ways we can go about this. One is to determine the history of the laws in Singapore and the other is to question how is morality determined. Historically Singapore's laws were inspired by UK's laws after colonisation and UK's laws were inspired by the morals written in the bible. And if we take the philosophical route on how morality is determined in society, we have Moral Subjectivism, Cultural Relativism, Ethical Egoism and Divine Command Theory. But if you read up on the different theories of morality, most of them are individualised and would fail to be represented as a majority, except for the Divine Command Theory.

Your idea on the harm principle is also fundamentally wrong because you imagine it to be physical harm. The problem is that society is not just composed of the majority. There are minorities who are not able to handle the psychological impact of having LGBT be prevalent in society. An example of a minority population would be children. How are we going to teach them that it is impossible for two men to reproduce despite them having as much rights in the law as a heterogenous couple? And the portion about akin to legalising theft and arson, I was trying to highlight the morality of the issue. I do not hate the LGBT community but I do think they have skewed morals. And, no, I do not think that we should be changing their skewed morals as well. Rather it is the activists, such as yourself, who are out trying to convince the rest of society to change its moral viewpoint so as to allow for enforced LGBT approval by the court of law as well as by societal norms. 

Lastly, John Corvino's work is highly debatable and if the selection criteria is strict enough, his work would also be deemed bias due to the very fact that he is in a homogenous relationship. You would be better off looking for meta analysis or systemic reviews about the LGBT community rather than a philosopher's attempt to justify his decisions.

9i530c,e6k40v2,"Most people would see the repeal of 377a as the first step to allow gay couples to marry/have civil unions. From that, they could potentially be allowed to be legally recognized as NOK, apply for HDB before 35 years old, adopt/surrogate children, amongst other things. These are some privileges of life that others take for granted. Some would mention that gays pay taxes too, and should get whatever the straights can. 

What some people are afraid of is the supposed moral and birthrate decline that's going to happen if 377a disappears. Personally, I don't see how that should even be a point. More realistic fears are that religious bodies/private companies are expected to endorse/condone future marriages (religious bakers got into trouble by rejecting to bake a cake for gays in the US). I don't expect this to happen here, seeing that organizations/businesses rightfully should have the right to refuse clients. Other fears include all toilets magically being converted to allow any genders to use (and therefore more prone to sexual assault), and the use of hormone/puberty blockers on children (I'm a little impartial on this).

As for your mention of STDs, the only way of curbing it is through sex-ed. People need to know how to protect themselves during intercourse. That can come with or without 377a being repealed, although I'd argue it's easier if it is repealed. As of now, schools in Singapore do provide some sex-ed (teaching the use of condoms, at least), but as far as I recall, teachers are made to keep the topic of homosexuality hush-hush or in a negative light, which may not help a young horny gay boy with questions. If the stigma's removed sooner, more thorough and open formal education would come easier. 

To add on to my point above, in the US, states that are more religious and taught only abstinence in schools have higher teen pregnancy rates. By inference, abstinence-only sex-ed does less to prevent unprotected sex as compared to a more comprehensive sex-ed programme. 

If a law is supposedly there to prevent the spread of STDs, should it not be the case that it criminalizes anyone with STDs who have sex? 377a does little to nothing to prevent the spread of STDs, gay or otherwise. Either way, if criminalizing an entire population for a subset of its group is Singapore's way of handling things, it's just sad. ",1,Cradlesong-,2018-09-25 09:06:21,e6jq6w7

consent has nothing to do with if a sexual orientation is valid or invalid. In fact how can a sexual orientation be valid/invalid? 
Homosexuality refers to sexual attraction between 2 adults of same gender. 
Adults who are mature and responsible for their own decisions. 
Pedos refers to an adult who is sexually attracted to underaged non-adults, namely teenagers and children, who are not mature enough to understand many things and could be victims of sexual grooming etc. 

There are so many accounts of pedo victims who had no idea what was being done to them and they are so affected after that. 

Completely 2 different things. In both cases, the sexual orientation is ‘natural’ aka born with it. But homosexuality is with a consenting adult, (if no consent, that’s rape isn’t it) 
Whereas pedo is with a underaged person unable to give consent LEGALLY. 
Consent has legal implications, of being legal age or else many rights of an adults are not given. 
Eg, driving, drinking, smoking, HAVING SEX. 

What do u mean gayness is not natural? 
Can you control which gender you are attracted to?
If you are straight, opposite sex attracts u and same sex making out repels you. 
If you are homosexual, it’s different. 
Can you control your sexual preference?
You can’t because it’s innate. Therefore it’s natural.

Regarding the second part, I do agree there was a reasonable, historical context for our principles (and therefore, laws), to be founded on religion. Times and peoples change, however, and the law has changed with them to arguably reasonable extents. Religious texts forbid sexual activity that does not lead to procreation, but we've removed the relevant statute anyway (the original Singapore PC s377 that criminalised oral and anal sex). 

How does 377A have any moral ground to stand on, especially if female-female consensual sexual activities have never been criminalised?

Religion will be protected before sexual orientation as it is right given under the constitution under “Freedom of Religion.” You mentioned that there will be no statutes they can fall back on but as I previously mentioned, no one will bring up that 377A is a reason not to be gay. They’ll bring up the Bible, the Quran or their own opinions of wanting a traditional family.

At the end of the day, your argument relies on the notion that religion is wrong, LGBT is correct when the right to practice faith is in fact a universal right under the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) and more importantly, under Article 16, marriage is only a right between a man and a woman. 

But let’s look at things from a neutral perspective: You state that it is discrimination that certain individuals do not accept the LGBT lifestyle but at the same time, you state that “(Religion) is just holy books written thousands of years ago and edited countless times by powers-that-be who had their own agendas” which is you also not accepting their religion which is also just as offensive. Now the main flaw is that both parties have their freedom of speech protected as they are able to use resources to speak out on this issue. However, what you are suggesting is in fact taking away this right for those who speak against LGBT issues. Thus, creating an unfair discussion and creating a societal change through unfair means which is silencing a majority opinion. This is the opposite of equality.

But really the worst part is the assumption that “my opinion is correct and theirs is wrong”. As I previously mentioned, LGBT people already have many civil liberties. Also, discrimination is such a loose term that is mainly used to label those that have conflicting views that do not the support the LGBT communities. Is it shitty that OP’s mum isn’t accepting of him being gay? Yes. Is it legally wrong for her to do so? No, it’s her belief and there are fews countries including liberal ones that would prosecute someone for not accepting the LGBT lifestyle in the same way they wouldn’t prosecute parents who don’t accept interracial marriages or spouses who may come from a poor background. It’s their personal opinion. You have to accept that at this time and age, not everyone will agree with you and that equality, while ideal, is idealistic.

The practical side has to do with legal rights and legal recognition of the marriage.

This affects children the most.

Yes I do agree with you on the part that laws are changing with time, but the reason for such changes are due to changes in society's morals due to the individual ebbs and flows of the moral subjectivism and cultural relativism with time. 

As for 377a's moral grounds, I'm not sure if I have mentioned this already but I feel that it isn't a law to punish the G community, nor is it any form of deterrence to prevent children from entering the LGBT community. Rather 377a in this case is actually a metaphor for Singapore's majority acceptance of the LGBT community. If it gets repealed, it would signify that Singapore would be ready to welcome the LGBT community and that society will skew its moral stand point in order to accommodate the new community. As for this accommodation process, it would bring about drastic changes especially in the sector of education, which we are definitely not ready for.

Are you saying laws and rights should be determined by whoever makes the most noise?

Look, what I'm trying to say here is that a religious reasoning for creating, upholding and enforcing laws in a secular society holds no water. You can argue against it on moral grounds, but to use such religious preferences as a framework for law in a secular society is nonsense. This is separate from whether there **is** influence, because whether there is, or no matter how hard it is to separate, there **should not be**. Forcing a Christian to pray to Mecca five times daily because it's compulsory for Muslims immediately shows that it's a terrible idea.

Together with the above, note that no one is forcing religious ministers to wed gay couples, or to ask them to accept them within their holy spaces. If they want to continue discriminating in their own spaces, then whatever - it's something they need to sort out among their clergy. But a secular state should not impose as such.

The Maria Hertogh situation feels like a completely irrelevant argument for a few reasons, chief of which is that while it is presented as a racial riot, it occurred because (IMO - I don't really have in-depth knowledge on the topic so I may be completely wrong) the courts did not even attempt to show that they had considered the appeal of her adoptive parents and returned her to her biological Dutch parents without much deliberation, hence raising issues of bias againat Muslims. Forcing her to stay in a convent and making her kneel in front of the Virgin Mary probably didn't help issues. Can you say that a secular middle ground (no idols of other religions, no other doctrine, if she wants to pray in the Muslim fashion let her do so and let the press release that photo) would have made things worse? I doubt so. Bringing the argument back to the present, I don't see anyone forcing Christians or Muslims to kiss their same-gender neighbours or being minister at a gay wedding. 

This is not even mentioning that the government has pretty much come out to say that ""we shall let Singaporeans decide"", and that even within religions themselves there are divisions on such laws.",3,lkc159,2018-09-24 03:57:23,e6hfjb1

You can practice your religion all you want, but once that impacts others' well-being, well, there's where your right ends. 

Furthermore, religion by their very nature of dogmatic proclamations, oftentimes end up on the wrong side of history. For example, in the US, the Bible was used as justification for slavery and segregation. In fact, there are still those who are salty about the outcome of the US civil war. Does that mean slavery is correct? Ironically, it's always religion that says ""I'm right, your not"", simply because of their dogmatic nature.

And it's not as if there aren't any places where such equality exists. These places haven't gone to hell (so to speak), and family values and communities haven't eroded to shreds.

More importantly, we have enough data to show that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as does not lead to any issues. On the other hand, this presents a benefit by reducing discrimination for a heavily marginalized group.

Say an individual happens to, for whatever reason, chance upon a gay couple engaging in sexual activity (remember how vague 377A is that any ""gross indecency"" is the punishable act?), then decides to make a police report on them.

The Police investigates, maybe there happens to be a CCTV nearby and there is evidence of the act. Can the Public Prosecutor choose not to prosecute? If the PP chooses not to prosecute, what happens to the rule of law? The offence would have clearly been made out in this case.

Sure, the PP and Police may choose to issue a stern warning instead, since the Government says they are not willing to enforce 377A. A stern warning may not be a finding of guilt or a conviction in a court of law, but it still means the PP/Police have found that the offence has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.",2,paper_boxes,2018-09-24 07:11:38,e6hnhod

Secondly, the previous comment said “psychologically” so it’s not physical violence which is the main issue and besides, when have Singaporean religious institutions ever promoted violence? Well-being is such a loose term and thus, having a fair set of rules that fall under it is better. It allows religious organisations to speak out against LGBT and vice versa. It also prevents this notion that individuals that don’t tolerate them are “discriminating” against them as they are free to do so as it is their personal beliefs.

Now you brought up the issue of the old church. However, it was never a fully accepted concept with not only opposition parties in those countries but other groups outside the strongly against such as the Mongols who wages wars and freed slaves. However, that was years ago and since then, international organisations such as the UN have been established to set agree to certain universal rights(see previous comment) and talk about more contentious issues. The fact remains that this issue HAS been discussed and it is not just a “you’re wrong and you can’t see it” argument. Religion is a fair argument recognised universally with certain rules when approaching it and Singapore has always chosen to respect religious organisations.

This is an issue that must be solved with time once people are more accepting like what you said but repealing 377A will not do that. 377A is not part of any national education or social studies syllabus nor do people use it as a reason to criticise the LGBT community. If you really want to make change, raise this issue to people who don’t care about local politics and inform them about its importance or talk to those who are on the fence on the issue. 377A is reflective of a society that is against the LGBT community.

There are plenty of married couples without a kids. no need for gay couples in that sense.

The repel of 377A in my view is because both are consenting adult. This make a case.But if an adult person is sexually attracted to children or to animals, society stops him/ her from acting upon these desires. This is to protect children or animals who have no capacity to consent to sexual intimacy. So the outlaw and criminalise pedophilia and bestiality for good reason, to protect vulnerable children and animals. Therefor as the kid cannot consent due to young age society norm which is a normal 1man 1 woman family should apply.

Instead, any history buff can tell you it has roots stemming from the ""Buggery Act 1533"" of England. In essence, it is a vestigial of English law. Ironically, even the UK  had dispensed with such laws about 40 years ago.

You keep saying repealing 377A will not give one more rights. You are not entirely correct in that it's two sides of a same coin. One cannot have the full complement of rights if certain rights are already withheld from the get-go. Furthermore, any law that stipulates punishment for a certain cohort, even if IRL it is usually not carried out (we can agree on this), by its very definition is discriminatory. The question is whether this discrimination is justified.

And please stop hiding your discrimination behind institutional regulations, including the UN. Stand up for what you believe and defend it logically. Don't appeal to authority nor appeal to the people. I will further claim that in my experience, *legal* does not always mean *just*. A clear example is that in 2008, rogue bankers almost brought down the world's economy, but most of what they did wasn't technically illegal and thus most were not charged. Is it just?

I will defer most of my arguments against institutional religion to another thread. Suffice to say, I find most religions hypocritical, even if I do recognize the right of others to practice them. In this example, Christians are against homosexuality due to passages in the Bible; what they don't practice, are the other directives. Where are those crowds arguing for the banning of divorces?

How is it biased. Did you bother to read up on the case?


>The justices, in a 7-2 decision, said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed an impermissible hostility toward religion when it found that baker Jack Phillips violated the state's anti-discrimination law by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012. The state law bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation.

Also are you seriously using age of consent as an argument? Ahe of Consent says that anyone under 18 doesn't have the ability and judgement to consent to sex. It doesn't apply to any other aspect of the child in question.

*For example, lots of kids don't want to go to school, by your logic i shouldn't send my kids to school because they cannot consent.*

Honestly yeah sure, anyone can adopt children. I'm not saying that only gay people can adopt kids, I'm just saying that if they have the ability to be responsible parents, they should be allowed to be foster parents.

While I feel that who you love shouldn’t be up for debate. You love who you love. As long as you are not harming someone, who gives a shit who you love. Go love who you want to love.


But unfortunately, homophobes who wants to keep 377A around (or any anti homosexual laws around) loves to say homosexuality is a choice, and that one can easily switch back and forth. So the homosexual community would have to educate them that it isn’t a choice.


“It’s not a choice” isn’t the only POI the homosexual community have to support abolishing 377A. It isn’t even their strongest point. They have a multitude of reasons to push for their rights.

Also you are still wrong on the issue of rights. First off, being discriminated is not the same as having your rights taken away. A right is something that people are entitled to. LGBT people still have their right to freedom of speech which allows them to operate and run events such as Pink Dot and in the same way, religious organisations are able to criticise them as well as you making comments criticising religion. Not accepting a lifestyle is not the same as discriminating against it. Discrimination is when there is prejudicial treatment but as we already mentioned before, they are still treated fairly and have the same rights within the legal system. People are free to not be okay with something and you can still carry on with your life. 

But at the end of the day, it’s still a fair society because everyone is still treated fairly with or without 377A because repealing 377A doesn’t give you the right to freedom of speech as you already have it.

For all of Germany, police estimated in a document leaked in 2016 that 1,200 women were sexually assaulted and that at least 2,000 men were involved, often acting in groups.Many of the incidents involved women being surrounded and assaulted by groups of men on the street. Cologne police chief Wolfgang Albers stated that the perpetrators in his city were reportedly men of ""Arab or North African appearance"" and said that Germany had never experienced such mass sexual assaults before.

9i530c,e6iaqi1,"**Same-sex marriage in Australia**

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Australia since 9 December 2017. The legislation to allow same-sex marriage, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, passed the Australian Parliament on 7 December 2017 and received royal assent from the Governor-General the following day. The law came into effect on 9 December, immediately recognising overseas same-sex marriages. The first same-sex wedding under Australian law was held on 15 December 2017.

9i530c,e6ip5lf,"That’s true, same sex marriage was made legal last year. I am curious as to where this great social experiment conducted by Western society will lead to? 

Besides the normalising of homosexuality, in western society, one is seeing an uptick in all manners of strange behaviour such as acceptance of fat people, transgender, etc. I’m not too pleased with the direction the once great western civilisation is going but hey, it’s their choice.

I’m hoping Singapore will stay out of this madness.

I believe you are referencing an AMA thread about lesbian? That is somewhat true that I’m curious about how lesbians get their kicks since by nature, lesbians lack the ‘tool’ to bring each other to orgasm. 

I don’t think I’m a bigot. Like I said, I’m not going to care what 2 adults do in the bedroom and the ruling government Ministers have pointed out that 377A is not really enforceable. 377A should remain as a bulwark against certain behaviours and as a last resort ",0,lycanthrope1983,2018-09-24 15:22:19,e6iapom

9i530c,e6kc1o5,"I'm of the opinion that most people inherit prejudices from their elders and authority figures, and don't take it upon themselves to ask why they believe such things. Frequently, this type of belief manifests itself as ""tradition"". Therefore, to fully understand such discrimination (and I use it in an objective sense, although I see you've put a negative connotation on it), we should try to understand its origin, so that we can discuss and debate why and how we should treat it now. I'm sure you understand the prudence of knowing history, lest we repeat it? Put another way, none of the Montagues and Capulets knew why they were supposed to hate each other; they just knew they should.
You keep saying homosexuality is a lifestyle, as if it is some sort of fashion or hobby, when clearly it is not. There are biological underpinnings of sexual orientation (like skin color) and it is not limited to humans (hundreds of other animal species have been observed with this ""lifestyle""). And to be clear, I'm merely calling you a coward for not owning your arguments. I have not implied that you're a bigot or an idiot. However, if you so choose to label yourself that, well, it is *your* right.
Finally, it's clear that you have only a superficial understanding of what perpetuated the 2008 financial crisis (hint: conscientious decisions were made), and the nature of the UN. Particularly, if you so choose, try to read up the issues that often trouble the Secretary-General of the UN, so that you may better understand how the UN can sometimes adopt severe compromises. Note that I'm not disparaging the UN, but merely alluding to the fact that it is a compromise (even if it strives to be the ideal).",1,MrFantasticallyNerdy,2018-09-25 10:56:08,e6k4adt

This is where i notice many religious folks dont realise the law protecting the minority from being discriminated by them also protects their faith from being discriminated against by others.

The problem here is that this particular case, the christian baker feels he has a right to discriminate against others based on his first faith. The Civil rights itself is not biased towards any religion.However in this specific instance the Baker's interpretation of his faith is that he should not serve homosexuals which happens to violate the law. Not all christians are as extreme as this. And as a result of this unprecedented event it went to supreme court.

I am explaining one of the reasons WHY the government is not pursuing it which is to stop a conservative ""flanking"" of it's political position, right now, the PAP has all opposition boxed in a ""liberal"" box, where it is quite comfortable defending itself.  If it allows itself to be attacked from the ""conservative"" spectrum, it will be quite a bit weaker.

2.  Can you cite some sources as to how the law is ""hanging by a thread"".  I gave you a specific example of Christian Church mobilisation against the repeal as an example of ""incredible life-changing consequences"" from the repeal of the law.  Just because you don't think it will happen does not prevent that possiblity from happening, which is a major factor in why the government has not repealed it.

3.  I never said ""what happens in america will happen exactly the same in Singapore"", what I said is that ""the Repeal of 377A galvanises the local churches into a similar political movement"".

There's a keen difference between celebrating one's culture, versus insisting that ""indian kids"" HAVE to be brought up in an ""indian"" way and not a ""malay"" way (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean), and forcing people to be something they are not.

Nobody militates identity, and nobody should. Human identity is something that evolves and is dynamic - that's what makes it profound and beautiful.

9i530c,e6nh1sz,"Yes. I'm one of the co-founders of [TransgenderSG.com](https://transgendersg.com), so I'm very involved in activism, and it's been tiring to see all the misconceptions people have about trans people and what activists are trying to do.

For me at least, and the rest of my team, we're primarily concerned with saving lives and helping trans people survive (and eventually thrive) - helping them access necessary treatment to alleviate gender dysphoria, connecting people to resources such as counselling if they are depressed or suicidal due to dysphoria, family rejection or abuse, trying to address discrimination in the healthcare system that make trans people reluctant to seek medical care until it's too late, working with LGBT-friendly companies to help qualified trans people find job openings - the majority of trans people in Singapore are either unemployed or underemployed, including those who are university grads and might have a law degree but end up at McDonalds or making coffee at Starbucks; many others resort to sex work because they can't find anywhere else that would hire them. There are teenage trans girls as young as 13 who end up in sex work after their parents kick them out, and this is a huge problem that no one else is doing anything about.

There's currently a single homeless shelter for trans women, The T Project, and they often struggle with enough funding for food (really basic food, like instant noodles and rice) and rent, because as an LGBT organisation they cannot register as a charity in Singapore. Other laws and policies meanwhile prevent most trans people from marrying either men or women, and from accessing public housing, various grants, financial aid; gendered laws around sexual crimes mean that a man who molests a trans woman cannot be charged if she is legally male, even if the molester was unaware of that.

We have no agenda beyond helping trans people survive and live decent lives in society. Our only concern regarding children is for transgender children (which all trans adults once were, and remember being) who are being bullied or who may be suffering in silence from gender dysphoria, not knowing that transition is an option or what kind of future lies ahead for them. But even then, we're not presently able to reach out to them. If and when we do, it would be specifically to identify and help trans kids, not to 'convert' anyone who isn't trans (which isn't even possible).

I wish people wouldn't keep referring to the West as some sort of example of where things are headed. We are not a Western country, and it would be more accurate to look instead to Asian countries that have decriminalised homosexuality, such as Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Hong Kong. Many of them have had legalised gay sex for decades, and since 1880 in the case of Japan. The West has many of its own issues and a cultural, political and historical framework that we don't share, especially when it comes to sexuality. Straight people in the West get up to all sorts of things that straight people in Singapore don't, and the same is true for LGBT Singaporeans, who are ultimately still Singaporeans and still fairly conservative when it comes to sexual expression, regardless of gender.

EDIT: I just saw your other comment regarding trans teens in Australia. It is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all. Children do not experience sexual attraction until puberty, and do not  understand sex (nor are mature enough to make sexual decisions) until they are much older. But children know what gender they are from a very young age, and the same applies to trans children. That decision in Australia is going to save many lives and likely already has. Suicide for trans people tends to peak around puberty. Accessing hormone blockers (which delay puberty, giving the child time to grow and keep any larger decisions about transition to when they're older) plays a huge part in preventing that.",1,anakinmcfly,2018-09-26 19:26:13,e6lumdu

""We""? Do you speak for everyone in your organization? The problem is that there may be others in your organization with very different agendas. Again using the current climate in the West for example, at first the gay community just want acceptance but now that they have achieved that aim they are becoming quite militant as observed in the recent Colorado case of the baker who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple. What you are doing is a political movement whether you are aware of it or not, and like any political movement it is prone to being hijacked by others who may not hold your simple values of just being accepted. They want more. On top of that, various other powerful political and wealthy groups want to make use of organizations like yours and the other various LGBT group to advance their own goals. This is why I always feel 377A should never be repealed.

But then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all? When I was young, there was only boy or girl gender. Now they want to redefine gender to suit their own goals, slowly working their way down to children. I mean in your own words, you stated that children do not understand sex and lack MATURITY but somehow you are a-ok with them knowing what gender they are. Dont you find that very paradoxical? 

I dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs. There is much about brain development in young children that we dont know about. For instance, the school shootings in American is causally linked to drug used to treat psychiatric disorder in youths. And these same drugs are rigorously tested to ensure safety and efficacy, yet there is still so much we dont know about and their unintended side effects. If people in the west want to conduct experiments on their children, that is fine but I would prefer Singapore stay out of it.

We also skew young - I'm 30 next year, the youngest two are still in uni - and the older members are even less political. Of course it's a political movement, though; all movements are political.

America has many, many, many problems of its own, including the way that many Americans are very argumentative and love to sue other people for all sorts of things. Whereas Singaporeans are stereotypically obedient and conflict-avoidant (even in cases of injustice when we *should* be speaking up), so I honestly doubt anything like that would ever happen here. If it did, it would die off pretty quickly. We are not Americans. The contrast between Pink Dot and the average Pride march is a good enough indication of that.

America's anti-discrimination laws were also the product of its racial history with segregation, and how those laws were specifically enacted so that businesses could not discriminate against racial minorities and other marginalised groups. This is not the case in Singapore, for better or worse - which is why you can see rental ads declaring 'No Indians' and such. Which is terrible, but I'm not sure the law is the best way to deal with that.

Nonetheless, I do think that this too falls under the umbrella of acceptance. A society where the majority of businesses refuse to serve LGBT people would not be an accepting society at all. While I believe people and business-owners should have the right to act according to their conscience, there's also the question of where we draw the line - what if a gay man has cancer and hospitals refuse to treat him? (which has happened to at least one trans man, who died as a result.) Or restaurants refuse to let him eat there, and grocery stores won't sell him food? At some point I think there need to be policies in place to protect minority groups and ensure they can access the same services that allow them to live and function in society.

In the US there's also a distinction between public and private businesses - private businesses are allowed to make their own rules regarding who they wish to serve, but public ones (which the bakery fell under) are not. Each is covered by different regulations and thus obligations. I think there's also some provision for refusing service to individuals (e.g. the recently-freed serial killer who murdered your kids) but not to an established protected minority.

> to advance their own goals

What goals would those be? I've seen a lot of fear-mongering around that, but with no clear motive in place.

> But then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all? ... somehow you are a-ok with them knowing what gender they are. Dont you find that very paradoxical?

Because the two have nothing at all to do with each other. It is entirely appropriate to ask a four year old ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" People do that all the time. But it is entirely inappropriate to ask that same four year old ""Would you want to have sex with me?"" The first question (which trans people are concerned with) is not in any way a slippery slope to the second (which pedophiles are concerned with).

> I dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs

I agree, but transgender children are not given any medical treatment until puberty. (Such treatment is unnecessary at that point.) Transition in their case is just social, and on a case-by-case basis depending on what that particular child needs. Most clinics that treat trans children operate on a harm-reduction basis: e.g. if a kid is crying every day because they want shorter hair, they can start by getting the kid a haircut and seeing if that helps. If that's enough, it can stop there. If not, they can continue slowly taking things step by step, constantly monitoring how the child responds, all the way to full social transition if necessary.

At puberty, if the child still fulfils the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and expresses clinically significant distress over the physical changes of puberty, they may be assessed as suitable candidates for hormone blockers, which not all trans youth may choose to have. These have been used safely for decades in children with precocious puberty, which is arguably what most children go through nowadays - a century ago, children didn't hit puberty until their mid-teens or later, so delaying puberty might even be beneficial.

While there may still be mild side-effects, the benefits in this case far outweigh any consequences. Here's [one long-term study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) of 55 trans youths who underwent hormone blockers at puberty followed by hormone replacement therapy several years later. The results after 7 years were overwhelmingly positive, where the youths scored equal or better than their non-trans peers on various mental health assessments. There were 0 suicides. This is particularly striking given that trans youth who *don't* undergo this treatment have always scored very badly on mental health assessments, with almost half attempting suicide.

[This other study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223) involved prepubescent transgender children who had socially (not medically) transitioned, with similarly positive results - developmentally normal rates of depression and anxiety, vs. the highly elevated rates normally observed in transgender children who are unable to socially transition.

So what we know right now is that enabling transition for trans youth *is* effective, and has been the first approach in history that has not just reduced but normalised the high rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal attempts typically associated with the trans community. That's why trans activists are striving to make this more accessible. I was a trans kid once, and if transition had been an option for me it would have saved me years of unnecessary psychological distress and resulting therapy, plus one suicide attempt, and I hope for a day when no more trans children have to go through what I and many of my friends did.",1,anakinmcfly,2018-09-27 18:25:53,e6nzx98

Here we need to step away from the LGBT community for a minute and consider a few things. If you look at the Democratic party in the USA, they werent always supportive of LGBT community (https://www.rollcall.com/politics/high-democratic-enthusiasm-gay-rights-wasnt-always). It is only after some genius within their ranks realised that they could use the LGBT community to score political leverage over the Republican and gain an advantage that they start to woo the LGBT community as a means of shoring up their power base. It is no surprise that currently in the USA, the same Democratic party is so keen on championing illegal immigrants to stay in 'safe city' that wont deport them because they represent an untapped voter base. This is not the first time in history that the Democratic party has resorted to such dirty tricks, it was done before in the early 19th century with the Irish community (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall#Immigrant_support). 

The linkage between LGBT movement and pedophilia goes back a long way to an organization known as North American Men-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). I am no historian and my interpretation of events could be wrong but as I recall when the LGBT movement was young, there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the LGBT movement and started NAMBLA after they got kicked out (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association#History). This is why alot of arguments about LGBT acceptance often leads back to the discussion about acceptance of pedophilia. I dont think you can blame regular folks for it since the history of the LGBT movement is tainted with this knowledge.

With regards to your comment about how 'safe' these drugs are, I disagree that they are 'safe'. No drugs are safe, all comes with risks and benefits even common drugs like panadol. The puberty blocker drugs are GnRH agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide, depression and anxiety

Yeah. So much of what's associated with Christianity today is the direct opposite of what Jesus taught, and doesn't make sense to me. I've since found my home within the LGBT Christian community, which has a strong focus on social justice, but without the aggressiveness that's typical of the activist left because we believe in loving our enemies and all that. It's a good place to be.

> I think the reason why Pink Dot is so subdued in contrast with Mardi Gras where it is virtually a parade of flesh is that SIngapore is conservative and the various legislations tend to have a prohibitive effect on what could be on display

Partly that, but LGBT Singaporeans also lean much more conservative than those in the West, due to Asian culture, not wanting to bring shame on their families, and so on. As always there are outliers, but they're still very much a minority. Even if the laws were relaxed, I don't personally know anyone who would march half-naked down the streets. Those who do tend to be those who are disconnected from their families due to rejection and it becomes a show of defiance against that.

> WHen you say that a transgender man died because the hospital refused to treat him, I think I will need to see some references for that.

Robert Eads. He was the subject of [this documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Comfort_(2001_film)) in 2001. ""Eads, diagnosed with ovarian cancer, was turned down for treatment by a dozen doctors out of fear that treating such a patient would hurt their reputations. By the time Eads received treatment, the cancer was too advanced to save his life.""

I know anecdotally of a few other cases from acquaintances in the US, though nothing I can cite. In the case of AIDS I recall a lot of gay men having trouble getting treatment as well, though there were hospitals that took them in. Sexual orientation and gender identity did not become protected classes in the US (similar to gender, race and religion) until much later.

9i530c,e6y6wq0,"> If you look at the Democratic party in the USA, they werent always supportive of LGBT community

That was the case of the world at large, though, as well as for many people I know, including my parents. Views change, especially when someone comes to personally know more LGBT people. The Christian church in the US is also an example of that - just a few years ago, the vast majority strongly opposed LGBT rights, whereas now more than half are supportive. And what changed wasn't any political agenda to get votes but more LGBT people coming out to their friends and families and making it harder for them to be demonised as a separate group that had nothing to do with 'normal' society.

I think it does a great disservice to the work and sacrifices made by countless activists and LGBT people making those personal connections, to dismiss it all as the workings of some insidious political conspiracy just out to get votes.

> but as I recall when the LGBT movement was young, there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the LGBT movement and started NAMBLA after they got kicked out 

Pedophiles who were attracted to and pursued relationships with boys may have found themselves banding together with gay men in a society that was very hostile towards both groups and considered both to be an expression of aberrant if not criminal sexuality. This doesn't make them gay men nor representative of gay men. The atmosphere back then was also very different - even among straight people, a lot of what was considered 'acceptable' sexual behaviour, such as straight men getting women drunk to have sex with them, or grabbing random women to kiss them in bouts of spontaneous passion, would today be recognised as sexual assault. From what I understand, the climate then also meant that a lot of young gay teenagers found themselves kicked out of their homes and left to survive on the streets. Many ended up seeking out the gay community for refuge, where older gay men took them under their wing and sometimes ended up in sexual relationships with them.

This does not make it acceptable. But I can understand why it happened, and it's also very different from a situation where an adult man knowingly seeks out to exploit a child's innocence by coercing or luring them into a relationship. One reason why pursuing sex with children is so wrong is because it robs them of their innocence. Those gay teens lost their innocence long ago. I think many of their adult partners were also not aware that this was wrong, because many were deeply sexually broken and had never had the opportunity to learn otherwise. The only thing they were taught was that all their sexual desires were equally wrong and worthy of punishment. The wider society didn't recognise any distinction between men having sex with men or with boys, and so while I don't condone this in the least, it's to be expected that the men in question likewise did not recognise that distinction.

But that has changed, which is why NAMBLA got kicked out. Right now, the vast majority of gay men - and especially the larger LGBT community - recognise the moral repulsiveness of having sex with children, and if anything, they are the primary drivers of the message that consent is crucial to any sexual relationship, and that children and young teens are incapable of giving that consent.

> The puberty blocker drugs are GnRH agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide, depression and anxiety

Yeah, I've heard that, which is what makes it all the more significant that trans youth who go on puberty blockers have remarkably lower rates of suicide, depression and anxiety compared to trans youth who do not receive that treatment.

> Just a cursory look revealed some interesting questions that the articles failed to address such as confounders or that questionaires are generally low tier in the hierarchy of evidence

I agree, but firstly when trans youth are almost consistently very depressed, anxious and suicidal except for this one group, it's still the best option if erring on the side of caution; the fact that they were even alive after 7 years to do those questionnaires is remarkable in itself. Secondly, the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults, some of which is objectively measurable (e.g. stress hormone levels in blood).

Anecdotally, I'm close friends with many trans people and have had casual contact with perhaps over a thousand through my activist work and online trans communities. I've seen the positive results of transition first hand in both their lives and my own - things like friends who used to cry all the time and regularly attempt suicide but then transitioned and are now very happy, haven't cried even once since then, and are living fulfilling lives. These examples are happening over and over again in every single trans person I have personally known, including trans children whose parents I'm in touch with. The difference transition - including blockers - makes is extremely palpable, and while higher-tier evidence is understandably required to make conclusions in academic studies, it isn't something that's necessary to recognise the difference between a deeply depressed child and a happy one. While I can understand people wanting more time to do long-term studies, it's the best default option for now, given what evidence we have.",1,anakinmcfly,2018-10-01 19:28:52,e6sly8d

Wouldn't they achieve the exact same goal (votes) with a lot less effort and resources if they didn't bother funding the LGBT movement, and instead exploited the existing anti-LGBT sentiment to get votes that way? If it's because Republicans were already doing that and they wanted to do something different, why choose LGBT issues, given that it directly impacts such a tiny segment of the population? Any immediate confirmed votes would be perhaps the 1-3% of people who are LGBT.

9i530c,e77rsef,"Oh, it’s Walt Heyer again. >_> His was a case of misdiagnosis and malpractice where he had dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) and one of those personalities was a woman, which got him wrongly diagnosed as trans and encouraged to surgically transition - which he didn’t feel right about, but was pushed through against his worries, and came to deeply regret.

There was a time where he acknowledged that he was never trans to begin with, but over the years seems to have changed his tune and altered his narrative to claim himself and his experience representative of the average trans person. He pops up all over the place now as the #1 spokesperson for talking about detransition, and how trans people should not be allowed to transition because it didn’t work for him. The fact that he’s this prominent is actually good evidence of the efficacy of transition for most trans people; if detransition were as common as he claims, they would surely be able to find more than the same handful of individuals every time. As it is, I often see handfuls of links about detransition cases and most of them are about or written by Walt Heyer.

Detransition does happen, but for those who have gone all the way through surgery, it’s something like 1-2% of trans people in total since 1960. (In comparison, ~67% of people in the UK regret cosmetic surgery). The regret rate has steadily decreased over time due to increased social acceptance, improved survival techniques and more knowledgeable doctors and patients who are thus less likely to wrongly identify someone as trans; current trans surgery regret rates are under 1%. (I have sources but I’m on my phone so it’s hard.)

Detransition cases I know of among the hundreds of trans people I’ve been acquainted with:

- two trans women and one trans man who detransitioned after converting to Christianity and being pressured to do so by their church communities and own religious convictions

- one trans man who detransitioned for political reasons and coming to agree with anti-trans narratives

- one trans woman who detransitioned due to harsh rejection from Muslim family

- one lesbian misdiagnosed as trans years ago due to lack of awareness on the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, and where internalized homophobia and misogyny pushed her towards transition; notably, from the start she was never comfortable being seen as male despite enjoying the freedom that came with it

- one trans man who detransitioned due to realizing she didn’t identify as male after all, but who didn’t regret transitioning because she still felt it had been the right choice at that time

- one woman who initially transitioned to male to escape unresolved sexual trauma from a past rape; after 7 years and therapy, and discomfort being male, she detransitioned

- one guy who went on female hormones and found that he felt a lot better on it, but that he didn’t feel like a woman after all, and thus socially detransitioned while continuing on female hormones

So it does happen, but they’re a small minority, and often it’s not a black and white case of regret (or even of full detransition all the time). Such cases can also be reduced by more knowledgeable doctors involved at the various stages who can identify red flags suggesting that something other than a trans identity is causing the gender dysphoria, and better education and awareness for people about what being trans is or is not, and whether or not medical transition is likely to be suitable for them.

9i530c,e7o8y4p,"It helps to look into why those adults regretted it, though. For example, misdiagnosis is more common for adults because they undergo much more lenient assessment - often a one-off diagnosis by one or two psychs, vs children who need to be assessed by a whole team of doctors and psychiatrists before social transition, are monitored throughout, and then have to go for another round of assessments before beginning puberty blockers, with continued monitoring. This provides more failsafes than it does for adults, who could just find a less rigorous doctor willing to approve them for treatment if they pay enough money.

There’s also how many of those adults transitioned a decade or more ago, when both doctors and patients were much less informed on trans issues and more prone to making misdiagnoses. Regarding regret in particular, many reasons cited often had to do with dissatisfactory surgical results or health complications (which thus concerned surgery and not transition in general), which have significantly improved over the years since the 1960s when those first patients were tracked, or from not being able to visually blend in with other people of their gender, which is a complete non-issue for those who transition at puberty.

Another large source of regret was the abuse they received from family, friends and society after transition, such as being fired from their jobs and kicked out of their homes and made to resort to sex work to survive; the regret thus came from deciding they would have rather tolerated living with dysphoria than have to live life that way.

Almost all of these problems do not exist for those who transition at puberty, who by necessity have supportive family, and who never develop the secondary sexual characteristics that would otherwise require additional surgery or make it difficult for them to look like others in their gender.

More than that, as a society we do already trust children and young teenagers to know their gender. If we didn’t, we would be mandating puberty blockers for everyone in case they turned out to be transgender and deeply regret going through the wrong puberty. Statistically, the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans, which is why we don’t; but likewise, a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans, and treatment thus errs on the side of caution.

She got quite huffy with me saying that I already declined her alternatives so she needs to go now to ""help someone else who wants to be helped"". Then she hung up on me lol. The call lasted less than 5 minutes.

To be fair, that phone call was an anomaly. I called several times again in the next few years and everyone who answered was helpful. 

SOS is staffed by trained volunteers so I guess there'll always be good ones and some that really should find something else to do. Don't let that phone call get you down, OP! Also, it's okay to seek professional help. Living with anxiety is a pain and having the right meds or therapy does help a ton.",70,plumpig,2018-09-29 08:50:32,9jmtwq
9jmtwq,e6u11fu,"Don't know how relevant this will be, but here's my experience with mental health. 

I suffer from agrephobia (a form of moderate anxiety) and depression. I've felt this way for years, but I often dismissed it as teen-angst, mainly because I was afraid and didn't know how or where to seek help.

My world was bleak and melancholic. I saw human beings as dark shadowy figures with every possible capability to hurt or kill me. To me, everyone looked menacing and sinister. I dreaded every moment I had to take public transport, it was like my worst nightmares came true. I would skip school once week not because I didn't feel like going, but because I physically and mentally couldn't. All I wanted to do was lay in bed and feel like life isn't worth living for. Sometimes I cry and I feel better, sometimes I'm so numb and broken that tears don't falls. I also self-harmed. I would cut myself, beat myself, bash my knuckles into mirrors and all sorts of things to make myself feel better.

This proved detrimental to my grades. During my O level year, my depression soared and every moment was like living hell. I was irritable and unpredictable. When people laughed, I felt like strangling and stabbing them because I was miserable and no one knew. I would hide in the stinky girls bathroom during recess and cry. I would have panic attacks in class but I had to contain myself and act like every thing was fine. It affected my studies a lot. I failed my O level that year. I scored 27 and failed 3 subjects.


I re-took my O levels privately (studied by myself) and did way better. The rest is history. 

I also had sleep issues. I couldn't fall asleep and when I could, I couldn't stay asleep. My mind was like a mobious strip of past trauma, going and going.

There came a point where I started to ask myself, ""Do I really want to continue living this way?"". 

That was when I decided to seek help.

My parents are relatively traditional and  at that time, they didn't know how to deal with my issues. They refused to be involved in this aspect of my life, so I had to do everything myself (I was only 18 then). 

After months of research and being scared, I finally mustered up the courage to get a referral from the polyclinic. 

Things went pretty alright from there.

 While waiting for my appointment at TTSH, I got to see the polyclinic psychiatrist and cried a bunch in his office. I was able to open the pandora box that was my past and talk about my traumatic childhood and experience with severe bullying when I was in secondary school. 

I was taught methods to calm myself down when in uncomfortable situations and taught to let go of the ghosts of my past slowly. 

It wasn't too expensive. Each visit was around $20 to $30 and I had to see him bi-weekly.

I finally started therapy at TTSH two month ago. We're still in the beginning stages of getting to know more about me and my past experiences and trying to find out what I'm most anxious about. 

I was made to fill up some forms in regards to my illnesses and I was also given advice on how to handle certain situations. 

As of right now, I'm in a new school environment, doing things I'm interested in and I have friends that are mature enough to not be judgemental. 

Of course, life isn't all fine and dandy, I still get panic attacks and sometimes I lie in bed feeling hopeless and cry buckets of tears, but at least I know how to deal with it in the moment and I have a support system. 

I have been clean for over 9 months. 

I highly suggest that you get it checked out. Mental health is as important as your physical health. Give it a chance, it's be for the best. 

Good luck!

I understand the idea that the others are suggesting about thinking about how other people in worse situations, but I also just want to add that just because other people may be in a worse-off situation, it doesn't belittle the pain you are going through. So, don't put off getting the help you need because you think your situation isn't that bad compared to others. 

I also get that you don't want to burden your friends with your troubles as I've experienced these feelings before too. But think about it, you'd want to help your friends too if they were going through a rough patch, right? Friends are here for each other, you don't need to feel bad for asking them for support. 

Also, I'm curious, you were able to connect back to the same operator each time you called back? I thought it would be randomly assigned, depending on who was available to talk.",38,greenyouth,2018-09-29 06:40:55,9jmtwq

Since that supervisor failed to tell you that everything will be fine, let me just tell you that everything will be fine-if you take steps to try to solve your issue.

I can assure you that it’s never easy for them.

Why would the ""enforcement side"" discredit her? And what stigma? The Police as expected by their remit and that of society must always check the veracity of any report lodged. That is always the first thing and this done by the process of an interview and taking of a statement that the complainant must sign. It also not done in a vacuum as there are investigators superiors that it has go thru and sometimes the DPP in AG chambers. The person mental record has to be considered and there is also referral mechanism for such cases. 

No law enforcement is going to call, detain or arrest anyone if the veracity of the complaint is an issue as it will not be fair to the other person. 

If the veracity is there, then the harder challenge is gathering corroborative evidence and it cannot be - you say, she say etc. 

No Police Officer can close a case or an investigation without the approval of his superior. 

One good thing is that people with mental challenges or challenging background are accorded special care as society is generally humane and Singapore is much more advanced in this field. There are also support mechanism that will be introduced by the authorities for such victims. 

Personally this sort of advice is best given by those who are close to that person or an professional in that field. I know of victims who never made reports after consulting others because sometimes the journey and experience of a lodging a report, court etc can be more traumatic than the actual event and or the lack of evidence leads to non-closure. 

Singapore is also unique as it is the only country I know where a Minister can authorise accused persons to be detained under CLTP for Gang Rape if the victim is so traumatised and is unable to go thru the court system and testify. We have also disbarred a criminal defence lawyer who traumatised a victim by his line of questioning in court. 

I also note that the natural reaction is to immediately encourage people to lodge reports in an attempt to ""protect others"" but this should not or never be the primary factor for such cases. The future health of the victim should be paramount driver in any such decision.

I want to say that when I first saw your post I believed you 100%. I know how little this happens on the streets in Singapore, but so much more so in private/residential areas and schools, to the extent that those who don't experience it are skeptical but- I know how horribly misogynistic and sexist people can be. A lot of Singapore doesn't like to believe that this can happen and that women are saying these things for attention or falsely, but I know how terrifying the attention and doubt is, and how few women would actually make those statements falsely.

I think you probably have also had enough of people calling you brave when you were probably more desperate and exhausted than anything else.

* As u/suicide_aunties suggested, I manned up and read the news report to make sure everything was accurate. It's on zaobao online, shin min and wanbao. All's good. Wanbao included an interview with the family who, predictably, denied they ever harassed me. They also claimed their gatherings stopped after 10pm. Doesn't matter though, because I think with media attention, hopefully (but I've been wrong before), the MPs will take us seriously.
* I spent some time with my mom and brother, who made my day so much better.
* I bumped into them downstairs and they started hurling vulgarities at me. Their grandma was also present.
* But we also bumped into a couple of neighbours who told me to find them if more problem arises :')
* When we returned home, one of the kids were sleeping outside. He woke up to glare at us. As we were walked by, he kicked a chair after us. Thankfully, I turned on my audio recording in the lift so I now have audio, pictorial and video evidence of him throwing the chair. My mom and him had some confrontation in Malay (she asked whether he's indignant and he said he was yadda yadda). Then he called his mom, who was the lady who messaged me.
* I messaged his mom when I got home, told her what happened, including her mom letting her kids hurl vulgarities at me. She wanted the video, which I promptly sent. She seems really apologetic after that.

94oz3t,e3n925k,">... My boyfriend was obviously, and rightfully, agitated but I  told him to not respond. Hope I did the right thing. 

You did the right thing. If your boyfriend punched the other person, it would become his fault. I would rather not talk about moral right and wrong (a judge might do that, and has real reasons to), but it's better for you and your boyfriend, in the long run, to be patient.

This simply adds on to your case that the other person was knowingly harassing you. (While you, on the other hand, acted calmly)

>People casted doubt ...  people say about me. 

I honestly think peoples should do more self reflection as it is one of the ways people can improve on their own conduct. The harassment is bothersome and I do not really know if there are massive legal consequences for people charged under it but I would presume there to be little. Judges also consider the severity of harm if it went to court, so I think you would not 'destroy' any lives over that.

The cases of sexual harassment, however, are *not to be tolerated in Singapore*. Under a principle of deterrence, heavy punishments are meted out. In any case, there would be many people like you who would suffer injustice, and the punishment has to consider the uncertainty around exactly how many people face such injustice in their day-to-day lives, which somewhat justifies how heavy they generally are in proven cases of sexual harassment.

Finally, I think it's important to note that you're still keeping a reasonable amount of good faith in others. An alternative is to become very cynical of others and assume the worst in others. This is a position some adopt but one I would not recommend because it makes living and interacting with other people very difficult.

>I don’t know what’s gonna be reported and I think I need to take a break  from this for mental health reasons. I experienced panic attacks and  I’m super worn out from having to defend, explain and justify myself.  Not asking for pity here, just to clarify. I’m just tired and rather  defeated. It breaks my heart reading the many private messages I’ve been  receiving on Facebook regarding other stories of harassment too. It’s  true that negativity sucks up your energy. 

Now that you launched yourself into the limelight (especially when you have  public Facebook, a public blog, and a previously-public instagram), there would be people who express scepticism. 

Please do take care of yourself. You should spend more time with those that matter more (i.e. family and friends), and honestly the people in the public who express doubt in your story matter a lot less.",6,oneofus-oneofus,2018-08-06 05:36:22,94oz3t

1. The price actually once dropped to 177 to Gatwick

2. The departure times to Gatwick are always unpredictable because Gatwick has some of the **most** atrocious ATC in existence 

3.  On 99% of flights, the flight attendants aren't picky if you change your seat as long as it's within your cabin. I've changed to those seats with bigger legroom and as long as the flights aren't crowded, they don't care.

4. As much as you love the window seats, try to get the aisle seat so you can walk about easily and not feel cramped.

94oz3t,e3mvg18,"Hi,reading from your previous post,i think it the fault of the parents not teaching them.it either seem their parents just let them be or just couldn't bothered at all.these is the type of kids who will eventually get jailed for their bad doings.they probably knew you can't attack them because the MP are not even willing to help you.

From my personal experiences,i too have suffered bullying from neighbours & sometimes school kids whenever i went to nearby shop due to my faces,but i don't really bother them because they will soon realised that 'what a strange childhood i have'.i always pray these kids turn into a new leaf.

For me,kids will be kids,but as a parents we need to guide these kids to the correct path.Yes most of the youth who seek to robbing people are not that bad,they may be having financial issues.

Back to the agenda,i personally think you might try to i nstall a cctv around your house(put in a place where it unreachable for the kids to take it down).

Have you tried talking to your other neighbour?were these kids behaving like this before you move in?If they did,then i believes these kids have no proper guidances since their parents couldn't be bothered about it.

Maybe seek a petition to make them move out?i am sure they might have done it for decades.this is public nuisances.i wonder how the other neighbours handles these issues so far.

To be honest,i don't really know any best way to seek help,but best alternative you might try to install cctv(record the kids harassing you or playing around your house.)

Again I have to mention, having lived overseas for a long time. There are many people that can snack all meals walk all distances and never ever be able to afford those trips like OP. Singaporeans really sometimes dont understand what it means to be low SES. 

I think most would understand your claims. Personally I have no issue with such claims because this is far less damaging than a lawsuit. Furthermore, if these are lies they can sue for libel or slander. My issue with these he said she said is ONLY when they are heard in a court of law AND judgement delivered based upon simply he said she said testimony. Ie. You shouldnt feel bad for sharing your opinions. It is free speech.

If not, I can perfectly understand why the kids call you a chee-bye, as to them, you are only doing backstabbing assaults. I understand your fear towards people and anxiety issues, but how would you feel if one day, out of the blue, someone just threaten you with law enforcement and lodge complaints for what you are usually doing. Sure, these kids have behavioural issues, but two wrongs does not make one right. You are equivalently guilty of not responding appropriately and aggravating the situation from the moment you chose not to communicate them as equals, but nuisance.

Of course, these comments will not apply if you did try to talk to the kids nicely before.

@auotts  So you are the mom of the OP, OP must listen to you? I'm only offering my thoughts here, you are telling what the OP must do.

@Jackheart31 So a few noisy 5-7 years old kids are as atrocious as someone who committed genocide? Pretty sure multiple kids were mentioned and the offence they commited are surely not all the same. Some were only responsible for loud noises at night or perhaps even victims like OP within the household itself. So just becuase their family/friends is a nuisance, they should be judge a sin as grave as Hitler?

868w56,dw3rulz,"Ok buddy, I’ve read everything and would like to give a more detailed response, but it’s kinda inconvenient for me now on mobile so I’ll edit this later on.

What I would like for you, or rather other people to know is to set up a LPA (Lasting Power Of Attorney). This allows you to nominate 3 trustees to take care of all your assets and make choices for your well being in the event of you becoming mentally incapacitated. It is different from a will. Although you should probably set that up as well. This will stop all the legal fees from piling up and shit like that. I’m sorry it’s probably too late for your dad to set that up now. But I hope this information will help others.

As for OP, you may choose suicide. It is a valid option but not one that I condone. If you haven’t already yet, Google superman and the jumper. Read that short comic. A TLDR of that however is that if you believe that there is a single day of HOPE in which you would feel happy, then struggle on and take the hand for support. IT IS NOT EASY. Yes that’s for sure. And as someone who rebuild himself at least twice now (3rd setback wasn’t really that bad) I’ll give you some advice.

Do not try to resolve all your problems at a go. It’s not going to happen. The mountain will only seem impossible.

Take realistic small steps that make logical sense. Start by identifying what you absolutely need and what would be luxury. At some point even a bottle of coke is luxury. You’ll need to accept that. 

Then work on it! Rebuild and focus on yourself. You are carrying so much negative energy now it’s going to be hard for anything to happen.

After that pray. Pray for the strength to endure a difficult life. Find sources of motivation. Stand tall and keep your head high.

I hope you will be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel one day. Good luck buddy.",3,LookAtItGo123,2018-03-23 06:05:52,868w56

You could even encourage them to pick up holiday jobs to help with the expenses.

You need to consider what is the best long term solution. As you say, you'll eventually be responsible for three other adults with your low salary, and it will not be enough. 

I think it's absolutely a reasonable AND responsible thing to do to go overseas where you can get a higher paying job and have the time and space to pursue a degree in your spare time, while sending back money to help support your family.  You are not abandoning them. There are many people who work overseas in order to have more money for their family.  Meanwhile, your aunt will be forced to step up to the plate and take your dad to the appointments, or you could potentially find a charity with volunteers who will do so.  Or as someone suggests above, a church would be great for that too. 

When you have your degree and better work experience, then you can look into finding a better job in Singapore and moving back.

Ask them to start taking on appointments and contributing a small amount (100/month) to his care.  Society is becoming less patriarchal - this means they need to take on some of the burden you're holding. 

2) Join the army or Cisco. You need money to survive in sg. McDonald's will be way more exhausting then a call center - and your job will likely get automated soon. At least you will have growth with Cisco. Start saving also - the money can go to it certs. 
 
3) Self care - take some time periodically to rest. Go for a walk, see friends in the park. Your wellbeing is important. 

4) Fuck the haters - if anyone who is not contributing to your father's care breathes a word of criticism about it to you, ask them what they are doing to help. Rope them in.

If didn't survive the stroke, I wouldn't exactly be in a predicament too since his gambling issue would automatically resolve itself.

But perception wise... it is just a matter of either giving him money to gamble (if he didn't get a stroke) or paying for his nursing home fee. Funny how the universe works in a circle sometimes. I have considered disavowing him too but ultimately, he gamble with the intention of giving everyone a better life. Can I blame him for that? The means may be wrong, but the intentions were well. If he had invested in a business and the business failed, the outcome would be the same anyway. Just perception imo. Do I disavow my parents if they failed their business and go bankrupt?

Let's say if I disavow him, there is still his two sisters to take care of too. So this is not really solving the root cause but just temporarily buying time. Should I disavow his two sisters too when the time come? Emotionally, I can handle it.

As long as you alive, as long as your spirit is strong (and it is judging from what you are writing) there is a chance to change everything.

I always admired people who follow their principles instead of following tempting trends. Do not listen to pussies, be yourself. Yes, you might be left alone, but every morning you will be able to look at the mirror and in the eyes of people around you with pride, instead of putting your eyes down.

Cheer up bro. Not sure if I picked the right words, but just believe me - do not.

868w56,dw3ivvv,"So there are some funny stuff in Singapore where the programs cater only to a small group. There are a couple of programs like this and for this case it is only for disabled individuals who have no one to care for them.

**ADHs provide long-term residential care for adults with disabilities who are neglected or whose caregivers are incapable of giving care.**

Another thing is the applicants need to be between 16 to 55 years old. I am not sure what happen to those after 55 years old. It's just weird but I don't run the program nor is it really informative. Social worker also recommended a program where I send him to a day care where he is taken care in the morning and then I fetch him back in the evening. The funny thing is that the van to pick him up comes at 8.30am and returns at 4.30pm. I am have to be at work in that period so I am not sure who it is catered for, but he didn't quality for it since he was bed ridden. I think aftercare options for major stroke patients are very lacking in Singapore, imo at least.

On the priorities,

1) Working on a income, in the past one year I tried many times. Self publishing book, youtubing, twitch streaming but its very hard for a guy and especially an asian in those field. Sadly, those provide actually very good time flexibility. I also dabbled in startup before and I won Singapore best startup award, but it was a meaningless award which I don't even have money to travel overseas for the mentorship programee. At this point, I am just very dissapointed in my life to pick myself up. What's the point of working hard? Just stupid paper money.

2) Can't really choose a family to born in so not sure how to change the home environment. But I try to be supportive and open to avoid confrontation. Too bad, I cannot afford my own home. Need to be 35 years old, funny rule again.

3) Yup, got the health insurance. Hospital insurance, rider too and accidental insurance. Didn't take terminal illness plan since it look more like a scam. I am still waiting to get into an accident so I can claim the payout though, its somewhat annoying that I am paying for something that I cannot utilize. 

4) When my family is uneducated and is very supportive of me going to work at a factory as a good job. I am not sure how to seek advise from them. Also I have the tendency to question certain advise because I have already considered and invalid the  possibilities. I think alot, my brain doesn't stop 24/7 and that seems to have chase my friends away. Or that their girlfriends are more important, not sure which. Likely both. If not forced, I wouldn't come online like this to get help.",2,GramTooNoob,2018-03-23 02:23:38,dw3h7cl
868w56,dw3j870,"I thought of sending him to msia too but his relatives was extremely opposed to it since they would not be able to visit him that often. Putting him at Yio Chu Kang already pissed them off enough. The passport also had to be renew every 6 months but that is a minor convenience. To be honest, he could get much better care and facilities for the price of $1.2k++ SGD in Msia but its hard to be a good person so I just let him be.

I considered going for a crowdfunding option too but... honestly there are probably more people in life that needs help more than me. I think I am still considered low end middle class group. If someone can sponsor me to go for my degree, that's actually a big help. It won't solve the root problem but its still a positive step forward. Yet knowing Singapore... hmm I don't have money to run a president charity show on channel 8. That's why I concluded I just need to kill myself and the government will step in and take over my place. It sounds a little drastic but kind money would probably find more use helping the more unfortunate. Maybe some orphan who may become the next Steven Hawking.

When people are asking you to save yourselves, they are not asking you to abandon others, you must ensure your own improvement so you can help them in the future. There is no point going to waste taking this burden on your own. You need to focus inwards for both yourself and your family.

I've had multiple people use that as a hook to try to get me to attend, some are in so deep that they even truly believe that it is God's intention that Christians help raise each other up economically so that their tithes can increase so that their ""House of God"" can become more glorious.

868w56,dw5d5mf,"To be honest, I can't tell you full details cos I'm afraid of doxxing myself, but what I can say is of the problems I faced - health, relationships, being jobless/aimless in life - problems like health which can't be cured by money, I eventually accepted my condition even if others didn't accept me; for jobs, it was alright, I just took what can earn me some money while keeping a lookout for other jobs too; i eventually asked a not-close friend for work opportunities at his company and joined him. It was great for a few years but the conditions at the company gradually got worse with a change of systems, and I had to quit.

I think it really takes time and not giving up hope. It's also good to ask people for help, sometimes you have to be thickskinned. I think generally, a lot of people are glad to help. Would say it's more of friends and outsiders' help, rather than relatives.

Just to share a story:
I once interviewed this lady in her 50s, she told me that she had this butterfly pigmentation thing on her face in her late 20s. It just appeared on her face one day after a day in the sun, and it gradually got worse and spread. She sought help from doctors and also did painful chemical peels and applied creams, but her condition only got worse. It felt like she got cheated of a lot of money and she was single too. But she carried on going to work every day, putting on a thick layer of make-up, as she told me. This carried on for like 30 years or so. It was only in her mid 50s, when she finally found a cure or technology finally caught up with a laser at those skin clinics that could lighten her pigmentation problem, and she's much happier now.

When I was hearing her story, I felt sad for her, mainly because of the time, 30 years, that she spent being cowed and unhappy because of her skin condition, putting on thick makeup enduring stares every day. 

I thought to myself: If I have a condition that can't be cured now, and I know that I have to wait 30 more years for the cure, do I want to live like shit now, or do I want to live as happily as I can while waiting for the cure.

I actually don't have a clear idea of how means testing are truly calculated and what schemes are there to help me. After I put him in the nursing home, none of the social workers came to follow up and I have no idea how to even contact one.

Sisters don't earn much, one earn roughly $2k/mth with OT and another earn around $800/mth. Since I am not working now, the total household income is slightly under $3k and well seems that is considered high?

Maid vs nursing home wise, there are more benefits to putting him in a nursing home. They fetch him to & froth hospital appt which is an add since he needs wheelchair and I have no transport. He also needs insulin injections across the day and 20+ medications + a soft diet. I dunno whether the maid will handle that better. Also maid wise, if the maid get sick... I have a headache. I also have no room for the maid to sleep.. maybe store room but... that is kinda inhumane. Oh, he also gets physiotherapy at the nursing home, so that's a big plus. If with maid, maid will need to bring him to outpatient center instead, which once again, I don't have transport.

I actually wanted to rent out one of the rooms in the house to help pay for the nursing home but I don't own the house. Its his sister's house and they don't want to so... I don't want to say much. I'm just a guest myself, living under someone else's roof tbh.

868w56,dw3qg4e,"Here's a small primer from ""The Ethics of Confucius"" circa 1915:
http://www.sacred-texts.com/cfu/eoc/eoc09.htm

""The responsibilities of the father are of course more serious and grave. They extend even to the avoidance of such comradeship with his son as might be misunderstood and so tend to impair the son's veneration. Thus, as has already been quoted, it is said: 'I have also heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son.' 

He must keep himself a veritable hero in his son's eyes, in order that he may command, and may be worthy to command, his admiration and reverence. This also he must achieve in very truth and not by deception; for in the 'Li Ki' it is said: 'A boy should never be permitted to see an instance of deceit.'

Lest the son should thereby come to regard the. father otherwise than as an ever-watchful and loving guardian, happy in his son's well-doing and grieved, rather than wroth, at his misdoings,""

What people tend not to know is that even if Confucianism encourages people to know their place, stay in it, and never strive to get ahead or fall behind - for fear of societal collapse - the philosophy as intended was also equally strict on people in powerful positions to do their goddamn jobs.

Unfortunately, Confucius himself completely failed to realize that people in power would only cherry pick the parts of his advice that would benefit them and completely ignore the rest. Juuuuust like many other religions and philosophies, really! 

Zhuang Zi (who is another philosopher - or perhaps a group of disgruntled ones) would constantly bring this up whenever the subject of Confucianism is broached. :3 ",3,A-Chicken,2018-03-23 05:40:15,dw3ikjz

You are the child, he is the parent, you shouldn't have to parent your parent. Taking care of the sick is one thing, but if he has been nothing but a burden, expecting YOU to take care of him, then that is just plain wrong. Did he just have kids so he'll have a free baby-sitter to spoon-feed him for the rest of his life? What about the rest of your life?

Your dad is the one who never grew up, and probably never realized half the stuff you are talking about or had any insight.

I've heard about this act - but is there not a way to prove that your dad has been irresponsible his whole life (you can show how he has gambled away all his money and how you have had to pay for his bills even when you aren't earning much) ?  

Also, I know Asian cultures treat boys and girls differently, but your sisters got to step up. How old are they? If they are adults, they have to share this burden. And if they had chosen not to, then you shouldn't have to either. It's nice of you to want to support them, but dude - take care of yourself first. Since you said you didn't do anything wrong, tried your best, then don't take up unnecessary burdens. 

You are not a bad person if you left - you didn't fuck over your child right? You didn't gamble away your family's money right? So you're not a bad person. Do not feel guilty for saving yourself first. (Remember ""put on your oxygen mask first before helping others.

i believe that i'm not properly diagnosed initially (BPD vs depression) because:
a) i'm not old enough yet. some countries want to wait until 21 before deciding that someone's essentially emotionally uncontrollably unstable instead of just being a teenager

Try to distance her from her family and confront but in a calm manner when, if her parents ever come to realise that she's being independent more than half the time of her life.",5,DjSynergy,2015-07-22 13:41:54,3e398z

Ok my GF has thought of moving out. I have offered to help chip in until she has a permanent job. However as her school fees for her degree was paid for by her other elder sibling (started working for a few years so could afford to pay first), my GF feels obligated to pay back the amount first. 


She also plans to give allowance to her parents too (I told her not to but she insists, I can't change her mind on this). So after planning her finance if she wants to move out she won't have any much money left. 


I do wish she could move in with me but I'm still living with my parents and there isn't a spare room. I still think this is a future possibility so I will try to work it out. ",5,thrwaysgacc,2015-07-22 19:10:15,3e398z
3e398z,ctbf9l7,"The quickest ""solution"" given that she's in her 20s and already graduated is for her to move out. Rent a place somewhere, or stay with you for the immediate time being. Note that in both cases, there will be other repercussions to come should her parents pursue the matter that may make her feel worse but it still looks better than continuing to stay with her family.

After which you will have to monitor to see if things improve in her emotional and mental state. 

In the meantime, bring her to see a counselor

Living together with toxic people will make anyone depressed. I do leave my own home since I was 19. (by studying+working away from home and never went back, except annual visiting.) My parents/family are not bad people but they are business minded, money oriented and very vocal about my profession/choice of study. (e.g: How much I earned is same as their blue collar worker, they have more than 10 workers.) Words came out from them usually are not kind/gentle one. And they are very pushy people with no sense of personal privacy/boundary. For me .. leaving my own house at 19 (with their financial support) mean, I have to ""trial-live"" on my own without car, cooked meal, washer, maids and everything else. But I believe that was my best decision.

I don't know how much money she can make, I hope she can afford around 400$~500$ for rental. I don't know where she live/work but room-rental around Sengkang area is quite cheap.

Most of the parents now, when they are growing up have their own kind of mindset and mentality and also attributing their own enviroment pushes their way of living towards their children.

I believe the GF's mom has her own mindset and stance towards money and thus for behaving that way. 

I would strongly advise you, to just be there for her most of the time now, often letting her know that you will be there her, try to help her be strong, not just because of this situation also but because to Live is to be strong, death is always the quickest solution and often not the answer. 

Moving out is a temporarily solution and might not help the underlying issues. (relationship with the family)

Being strong means, she has to accept facts and unfairness that is dealt to her, she has to know she can change her enviroment in due time, she know that something to live for is worth that wait.

OP is under the impression that the medication and therapy had totally no effect, and it was his subsequent decision to force himself to ""wake up"" and get his act together that kickstart his recovery from depression, pointing out that if the person could just find a way to find a fresh start, things will be different.

This is no different from the very ill-conceived lines mental illness sufferers have to hear from their friends and family that says ""cheer up, things will get better"", ""get your act together"", and ""you just need to get a hobby/get more sunshine in your life"" or ""be more positive"". This self-motivation crap goes into the same dustbin as ""If I can do it, so can you"" and shows a lack of empathy for those who are regularly having suicidal thoughts and having no sense of hope in their life. 

Correlation does not imply causation.

Back then I stopped treatment rather early due to the same belief that the treatment had no effect. My own recovery was more than a year after I cease my own treatment, but years later, as much as I would like to think that my recovery was due to luck, my own efforts, or a grand twist of fate or whatsoever, I cannot ignore the possibility that maybe the treatment did have a delay effect in ways I do not realize. 

In my past experience of being there for other depression sufferers, as well as hearing from those who recovered from depression, the latter group has always shown that there is a ""long"" lull period before they recover regardless of whether they are still receiving treatment or have ceased it on their own before they ""recover"". 

During that phase, they each have to continue with life before they eventually recovered. Nearly all attribute it to some reason such as a decision to not give up, to religion, or whatever.

Someone else I knew who recovered from depression could start a similar post and said she found religion in their life and that's how she recovered after ceasing treatment.

But that isn't right. It shows a lack of understanding of how depression really works and how the recovery process works. 

As much as OP has good intentions, my experience of being there for others with mental illnesses tells me that this will be poorly misconceived by many people. There will end up having people who out of a lack of understanding and patience use this post by OP to point out to their depressed friends or family members to just get a fresh start thinking that depression can be cured that way.

How many combination of drugs did you try? Because if you tried just one and gave up, it doesn't mean that medication didn't work. Psychotic drugs react differently with different people and there are different combinations that doctors prescribe until you find the right one. Just because yours didn't work doesn't mean it won't work for the rest.

So you just stopped treatment and decided to focus on your study and it worked? You're considered lucky since you can just pull it together. Some people just can't. Period. They can't just ""find a fresh start"". Depression comes down to the chemical molecules inside you and also a little of emotional encouragement. Drugs and psychological counselling help with that.

  I'm not qualified to tell you that everything will get better. Maybe, maybe not. I also can't claim to know what you're going through. All I can do is tell you my experience, like many other of our brothers here. It is a unique experience, that only a handful of our singaporean sisters and foreign settlers can exchange with others.

Many of us older gents will probably cry foul, since most of us will have served 2.5 years, some even more =) but the time doesn't really matter. We all go through good times and bad times. some more than others. Most of us would have had a thunderflash in our tent at some stage. Stood in a parade square for hours and hours. Rejoice at the Cat 1 alarms. Most of us will now talk about how we had to train our chin-ups every day, and express our hatred of the legendary SBJ. 

Many of our dreams were destroyed, abandoned. Dreams of travel, or passionate endeavours. And when that happened, there was simply a void, filled only by days of hentak kaki.

I also clung on emotionally to a girl. She moved on as well. That hurt a lot, but what the service does is desynchronizes our journeys. But hey, on the bright side, I got to pick up one of them 18 year olds in a couple of years (and nowadays, I stay far far away from them =) ). 

Almost everyone of us, I'm sure, have thought ""hmm... I wonder how hard it would be to swim from Tekong to Singapore"". Hide under the jetty, and hitch a ride on the ferry, perhaps =). Honestly, I too wondered how I would get through it all. I also spent many days going through suicidal ideation. Some colleagues would try to get me to go to their church though I declined. I also didn't have such a large support group either as I wasn't too great at making friends (go figure). 

Eventually, though, I got out, as you will, but it is never over. I still can't look back fondly on those years. I still get nightmares. I went for therapy for a few months. I still struggle with the ideation. Things are better for me nowadays, but things could spiral out of control at any point. But at least I feel like I know what keeps me going currently: 

It's the realisation that *everyone is suffering*. 

They will not show it. They dare not, and cannot show it. To show weakness is to be inferior to others. To show sadness is to burden the ones close to them. They put on fake masks that brings joy and smiles to everyone, but struggle inside day by day. And when it gets too much, they act as a child reaching out for help; tantrums are thrown, tears are shed, throats are torned from screaming. Even the people that we look up to the most will find themselves in lost situations, and it is at that point that we realise our parents are also children.

I can't guarantee you that things will get better. But what I can tell you is that **you're not alone**. This isn't a ""hey, think about all these starving kids in Africa"" attempt. I'm not trying to belittle the issues that are close to your heart. What I'm saying is struggling is what gives meaning to our lives and makes us who we are in the future. And while everyone out there might seem to be coping just fine, they may simply be much better at hiding their feelings[1].

It may be hard, but look to the future, of which there is a long way ahead. There will be more obstacles in your way, and you will have to find ways around them. The top of the mountain is all the more satisfying the higher it is.

One day, pass on your experience to the ones who walk behind you.

2inua5,cl5o9a7,"While I can't give you any professional advice, I can say that I've been in your shoes.

When I when in army it felt like time stood still, the world in camp never changed, same old thing day in day out, doing the most meaningless things. I got very upset thinking that life out in the world was passing me by. 

On Sundays I would feel physically ill from the thought of having to book in at night. I don't think that I was depressed.. but I definitely felt caged and unhappy with life. For awhile I was very upset with my stay-in situation.

I would like to say that it got better for me, but it didn't. Things certainly looked up closer to my ORD date but otherwise I wasn't happy for the most of it. 

However looking back now, my biggest regret is that I didn't make more out of that 2 years. I have seen army mates who have become the best of pals, others who have been super garang in army convert that attitude to life now and are excelling in their fields. 

But for me? I don't have a single friend that was made in army. My bunk mates regularly meet-up and hang out and each others' houses but I am never called. 

I could have spent that 2 years picking up a skill but instead I chose to mope and be sad about it. If I could do it differently I would have been a more productive member of the army. 

This is a very rare time in life that you can completely try anything and fuck it up somehow and know that you'll still have a job, something to do, something to live for the very next day.

You can pick up a skill to practice in camp, make more friends, be a dick to people for fun, run more, get gold, get ripped, eat more, watch videos, anything! The army doesn't expect you to be smart at anything, just do the bare minimum and the army will love you. In no other circumstance you can find this kind of life.

What I would have done differently then is to do something that will have benefited me today, you think life is difficult? Wait till you ORD and you face the cage of Singaporean life.

Another time during guard duty, we basically went all ""fuck it"". On my final duty, I drew my rounds (was doing prowler), brought my stuff up to the guardroom bunk, and slept my two hours away.

You seem to have the idea that once you get connected to medical services you are doomed to a life of abnormal-ness based on what you observe of people who get connected. But the fact is seeking medical services in itself does not equal = life going down. That's because people who *didn't* seek help and destroyed their lives is not as **publicly noticeable** as those who *did* seek help and destroyed their lives (that's the danger of going undetected, unnoticed - you never know what happens to those who slip under the radar. You could disappear and no one has a very good clue why). In fact not seeking help could be far worse, because you are in denial (extremely true of people too tired to make sense of things, speaking from personal experience and research), and you have to cure yourself (a little problematic isn't it?).

Edit: Oh I just thought of an example. 2 wives, Wives A and B, suffer from abuse from their husbands. Wife A chooses to hide it from the world and continue getting abused because seeking help ""means I have a problem"" (which is wtf?! so if you don't seek help, the problem never existed, and the abuse was an imaginary ghost?). Wife B reveals it to the police, and even though there was short-term pain from getting separated from a husband 'she loved', in the end she regained proper freedom. Go figure OP! You can do it.

You always walk out of the school gate at the end (or out of ubin, wherever you do your camps), no matter how much you sweat.

Identifying the feelings, realising the source of said feelings will enable one to take actual steps to take action on them.

Looks like someone preferred bro'ing around in the gym, rather then hitting his 6Ps and pre-readings hmm?

If I am wrong, I apologise. If I am right...

Don't sign on if you are that person I think you are.  No comment for NSFs in SPF, but generally friends working as regulars in the police force, they are practically married to the job.  Brb 12 hours shift (and more) a day, being called back on off days and just too tired to do anything else.  Sure like any other jobs, you can find a way to ""lepak"", but you will just be miserable that way and it will just make you think of breaking bond. Yes, SPF does award sponsorships for officers to get a degree (the HALO award), but that is usually given to a small handful of people - officers who are hardworking and pretty much excellent officers (btw, SPF would rather keep you a PO then a SO; they need more POs then they do SOs).  Does a person who prefer ""lepak work"" fit the bill of a HALO award recipient?

I am guessing that your friends has alot to say about the  ""matreps"" in CD as well?  I can say that majority of them comes from difficult background, only secondary school educated and aren't so lucky in life.  So yeah, of course they are going to be envious of you rising above them, just because you have a diploma.  But so what?  Learn to be friends with them, learn that there are things you can learn from them and that they can learn from you. Heck, encourage them to get into ITE after ORD, you have high chances of becoming a specialist in CD, so use your higher status to help them improve.  I find that those dudes despite their tear-drop tattoo and that dot on the forehead, tend to be quite loyal friends once you have gained their trust.  So instead of trying to avoid them, treat them fairly and you will do fine in your 2 years in CD.

My advice.. proceed your NS in CD dude.  Meanwhile, pick up some important life skills like critical thinking, work ethics, time management and social skills while you are in there.  Work hard and don't slack, you will gain things that will be useful to you for life.  Get some new perspective and mature a little bit more then I think you would be ready to think about signing on.

First you have to ask yourself some questions and perform your own cost benefit analysis.

What's the cost of going to the SPF over serving your 2 years of NS in CD and working outside / getting a degree?

What's the cost of NOT going to the SPF? Will you be able to afford to finance a degree on your own? Do you need the 30k lump sum to jumpstart your 'career'?

Are you willing to pay that opportunity cost, the next best opportunity forgone?

Basically, what's your best alternative to a negotiated agreement / next best option? Would you be happy in that alternative?

Which schemes would you sign on for if offered? Have you prepared for the interview and trained hard? (not just in check, I mean IPPT gold, reliably.)

Would you be disappointed if you were not offered a scholarship / sponsorship for a degree after your service?

Would you dedicate yourself fully to the service (i.e were you always very interesting in joining the police force, can you contribute to the organization in a significant, meaningful way. This benefits both you and the organization as greater contribution leads to a faster career track, of course)

1. You are not going to know much about what you want at 22 years old. I don't know what i want at 21 years old as well. I took IT because I was so ignorant about adult work life that I choose something I knew to do: something to do with computers. It was kind of the wrong choice looking back. Its perfectly normal not knowing where the road leads you. I am sure many of the folks here are in that position.

2. You are feeling like you have to make the most important decision of your life. If you make the wrong move you are screwed. That's because up to this point you do not have to make so much decisions in life. There is a way to switch. Its important to make sound decisions, with good data and knowledge but if you fail, realize it early and pivot. I have seen folks realizing that after 1 or 2 years in their trained vocation that doesn't 'suit' them, and pivot. Let me share with you something: even at age 35, I don't see myself in this job for the next 20 years, and I dunno what to do. I think this is normal. What is important is whether you have that **second level skills** to find out how to pivot in life

3. Signing on for some people can be a long time, and for a lot that I observed can be a 5 to 10 year decision. When you are in there, there is this toxic culture at some places that tells you there is no future in there and you have to get out. For 7-8 years of my work, I worked with SAF regulars and NSFs, and I have seen folks that believe in their work, and the disillusioned ones.

4. You are afraid that you would be badly influenced. The problem is that you perhaps don't trust yourself. Environment factors influence a person very much. I was able to study well because my secondary school friends were conducive, but i can see a situation that I can turned out badly. If you anticipate that, surround yourself with a good environment! Learn to be selective about your environment!

5. I don't like my job. Haven't been since I graduated and work for 11 years. That doesn't mean it will suck. What matters in ANY job is that you BUILD UP COMPETENCY. If you become so good at something, it becomes easy for you. It suck less. You may learn to love it. You don't need passion at work. You need to be real good at it.

6. You talked about migrating but need to ensure your family is taken care of. Someone mentioned that the civil sector pays better for those that are less academically qualified. I agree. You mentioned contrasting thought about that $30,000. If you ask me at 35 is $30,000 a big deal, I would say... yes it is still a big deal for me. When I talked about **second level skills**, these are modules in Life University that you need to master, that is needed till you die. Wealth Management is one of these modules. If you failed this module you are f&*ked. Wealth Management is simple but not easy.Recently I shared [**some advice learn in my 20s for folks who are on the path of financial independence**](http://www.investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/my-advice-to-the-20-something-on-the-path-to-financial-independence/) this might be useful for you. You might also wanna check out [my generic formula that I use to build my wealth](http://www.investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/my-best-friend-asked-me-how-to-become-wealthy-this-is-what-i-told-him/). if you read through the 2 guides, you will realize how freaking important that $30,000 can be and not getting into debt.

7. When I was at reservist in the airforce, i saw a very detrimental culture there where the regulars make use of their pay to study a 4 year degree course part time and then quit.I say detrimental for the air force, but think about it, you don't need a sponsorship.Treat the few years as a way to get a degree WITHOUT going into debt. To be able to afford university is a matter of how flexible your brain is in coming up with solutions. [read this](http://www.investmentmoats.com/budgeting/getting-your-child-to-pay-for-their-own-university-fees/)

8. you think you hit rock bottom because you think 22 years old is very old. what about folks like us at 35. I wouldn't even dare to say i have seen everything. How you view life experience is [like this graph here](http://i.imgur.com/U5pZT0a.jpg)

9. Take inspiration from [this millionaire base ball pitcher who lives in a 1977 van](http://www.investmentmoats.com/financial-independence/the-millionaire-baseball-pitcher-who-lives-in-a-1978-beat-up-van/).

377kvg,crl5sh3,"i'm not really qualified to answer but when has that ever stopped me from giving an opinion, so here goes:

you feel like you hit rock-bottom, take a breather before deciding.

Uniformed services means regimentation: you **must** be able to conform and follow the rules if you want to 'make it'. 

I think that's the baseline if anyone asked me. You must be able to meet that requirement at the minimum.

Then there's passion and drive. If you just want to slack there's actually lots of people in uniformed services that don't really like the work they do; but if you have such an attitude it's not gonna help in whatever job you do lol srsly.

all regulars have to do some form of shiftwork at the beginning. office hours/desk jobs only come later.

usually advancement requires doing frontline shit at the beginning.

imo the most worth it vocation is NPCO, provided you have the right attitude (passion, drive, service, integrity). The work gives you a lot of real experience, and that's where you begin to accumulate detective (nowadays IO) experience. That to me is the most police of police work and the most rewarding/challenging. It also has the added benefit of being just a little bit more useful even when you don't necessarily have that same level of physical fitness. [e.g. private investigators, criminal defence work].

on the other hand there's lots of other departments and units in SPF. Maybe PCG might suit you. Once you're au fait with the technical skills I heard it's pretty much sit in boat/cutter the whole shift, of course keeping watch etc etc I can't go into more details without being unfair to its image but you can ask around.

Also, shift work is shift work, that's how it is. You will get tired/sleepy but hey your team mates will as well. People are human.

If you look around the market, gahmen uniformed services pay pretty well for non-degree holders in general  - and has structured advancement prospects and training. I mean unless you feel like doing something with you diploma in the private sector (which you say you don't) it can be considered.

As for sponsorship thing I've heard people signing on with O levels getting sponsored for their diploma all the way to degree. 

Lastly, adopt a positive attitude; because SPF (or CD) involve serious work so they wouldn't want half-hearted people. don't hang around too much with negative people that put you down.",1,Classifyd,2015-05-27 00:58:02,377kvg

My advice is also the same: serve NS first, mature a bit, & pick up some life skills along the way. You'll need them to adjust to the realities of working life later on, regimentation or not.

Don't give up your diploma too. Many tertiary grads don't work in the same field they study for. But having the paper qualification entitles you to a better basic pay grade than otherwise.

If you meant a more ""senang"" or ""mudah"" career (instead of ""lepak"") in the uniformed services, take a look at their MSO/MSS support staff jobs which are office-based & organized like their counterparts in the civil service.

1. For your first paragraph, you're partly right bro. I was doing well in Y1, but hit rock-bottom when I realize I'm struggling really hard with coding in Y2. I attended UT clinics...read coding books in the library, did W3schools.com practises.. asked those who are better than me to teach me and gave me tips and shortcuts. It's still the same man. Coding requires years of practise, and with me jumping from Business school to IT, it really is a culture shock for me. I guess it's something I'm not meant to do.

About second paragraph, you have nothing but the truth. Yes, I'm confused now with what I want to do after NS, but I'm not lying with what I meant by ""lepak"". I should've used a more better word, but nah, I don't regret it. The replies are good.

3p7h6q,cw3tega,Hi hi OP. Fyi your skin condition will require either of the following treatments to have a guaranteed positive result: chemical peels or laser treatment. Please don't be intrigued by beauty salons that don't offer either of the two. I would save more money and spend on actual effective treatment instead. Try Freia Medical. Dr Ma is a meticulous doctor. ,4,loonylovegood,2015-10-19 00:42:05,3p7h6q
3p7h6q,cw3wys9,"No, don't get facials from cosmeticians. It can make things much worse if you have sensitivity to the ingredients used.

I would suggest seeing a dermatologist. Your acne scars can be treated via things like chemical peels, laser resurfacing or microdermabrasion. Not only that, but the dermatologist can prescribe a Retinoid (or Isotretinoin if the acne is severe) or anbitiotics to help with your acne issues.

The cheapest route is probably to get a referral to the NSC. The other option is to go to clinics like Maple that feature rather good medical skin care. While that can be more expensive, it's a good compromise between going the private route while not needing to pay the really high prices associated with derms from the private hospitals.",2,ceddya,2015-10-19 05:04:17,3p7h6q

9hwsh9,e6fhgqu,"If this is the school that is next to the Shell station, and in the west near a certain mall, I have attended it. To be honest, it did scar me mentally and emotionally.

I believe there are still some good teachers left, but many of them left due to inner politics and some cases of ""corruption"". The sadism of the teachers is observable, and I am often under the impression that these teachers think very highly of themselves. Especially the teachers in charge of the student council.

Things are only going to get tougher because it is an IP school, you still have many years to go. Transferring is a tedious process, so I do not exactly encourage it unless it is a last resort.

Here are some advices I could give you. There are a few ways to go about this:

1) Get really good grades(start studying like hell)
One thing I observed in the school is that the teachers are rather biased against students who perform poorly. They treat them like deviances. While some teachers do extent help, their impression of you is quite different from that of top scorers. 

To beat the system, first conquer it. Follow the rules, don't be late for school etc. Try to fit in first.

Once you are not mark as a deliquent (by deliquent I mean doing poorly in test), it will give you more free realm in the school

2) Think critically, and learn to not give a shit.
The student council, in retrospect, are really puppets of the teachers. And the teachers have certain ideology of their own that are not representative of the student population.

I realise only after graduation that many of the ideas the student council, in essence the teachers, are trying to implement is rather...full of shit. 

There is no other way to go about it.

There is a time when they did sexual education, and they labelled the whole male student population as ""sexual predators"". I'm not kidding, they were blatantly exhibiting sexism and advocating nazi-feminism in their speech.

There was also a toxic level of emphasis on leadership, as if it was the only quality that matters. They organised leadership camps that repeats the same formula every time, as well as all-boys-camp that felt like BMT. During these all-boys camps, we have to call our teachers 'sir', treating them as officers.

I have seen really smart students buying into their ideology. They were acting out of character during these camps, kinda like those Youth leaders during Nazi era or Mao.

Leadership is something cultivated over time for many people, it is not something forced out of you after a three-day camp.

That's why it is vital to always think for yourself and analyse the school's policies critically. Know your priorities, understand what really matters, and learn to filter these excessive noises. Don't mindlessly follow the crowd, but also don't stand out too much.

Most importantly, learn to not give a fuck.
It's not going to be easy. 

3) You are responsible for everything that happens to you.

This is a ideal that I believe, if taken the right way, empowers you to change your life. 

It's true, none of the terrible things that happened to you is your fault. They are terrible things, terrible people, terrible circumstances...fuck them. It's not your fault.

However, the problems in your life doesn't go away by shifting the blame. Removing yourself from the equation is only delaying the issues. Indeed, these terrible events is not your fault, but how you choose to deal with them is your responsibility. You are not a victim, you are just someone with terrible luck. A person can choose to live in depression for his dead child, or move on with his life. He has his responsibility to the people who cares about him, and most importantly his responsibility to his own life. Nothing takes that responsibility away from him.

It might be delusional, but never underestimate the power one obtains from facing his responsibility. ""With great responsibility comes great power"". Understand that these issues you are facing are not permanent, and you are stronger than your problems. You have the choice, and responsibility, to handle your life. You are in charge of your life. You are stronger than your problems, and you can deal with  them in your own way. Not by blowing up the school of course. I know you want to.

Things will get better. Or worse. But you are responsible for whatever that happens. You are in charge, you are not powerless.

Things do get better for me after graduation, I hope it does for you too.

I wish you all the best in that certain school.",30,entropyboi,2018-09-23 02:38:49,9hwsh9
9hwsh9,e6fp0da,"Hang in there! My mother once told me this, “why let the people that you don’t like, that don’t care about you, determine what happens in your life? Why let these people, who will disappear after 1-2 years, affect your grades and achievements, things that will stay with you for life? Why let them exert such a strong influence on you, or do you want to reserve that place for people that you are closer to?”

I’ve had bad experiences in primary school as well, due to my sometimes extreme views and bold nature. There were teachers that physically abused students for getting their math problems wrong, teachers that singles out students (myself included) for shaming, teachers that yelled at me and threw my submitted work onto the ground, classmates that called me names, ignored and ostracised me. 

I worked silently myself, and thought “who are they to judge me?” I obtained multiple awards in various academic contests and olympiads then, and DSA’d into a good school. 

> Your method is shit!

Well this one solved me multiple questions and won me an award. You can have fun with the shitty method taught by the teacher.

> Ya la ya la you're so smart right? Go away lah, smart kid!""

Ok, have fun with your TYS, I’m going back to RuneScape. I already have a confirmed place in a good secondary school.

In the end, I got a 265 for the PSLE, and was ranked #4 in school. Ranks 1-3 were pretty nice people that i was on decent terms with, so theres no salt about that. 

In secondary school and JC, one thing I’ve learnt is that demerit points generally dont mean shit. The highest scoring students in my class skipped 90% of lectures and are frequent late comers, much to the ire of the teachers. Just don’t do any stupid shit that gets you suspended or expelled. The main goal in an IP school is to do well enough to get into a university course of your choice, and maybe get a scholarship if you want. When it comes to those, no one will care about that time you got a demerit point for doodling, or the time you were late for class (or didn’t show up at all!) unless it was a serious disciplinary record that schools are forced to disclose. 

> “Helping her to revise? Don't bullshit me! You always try to be different and it makes me very irritated. Do you really think you have the choice to do what you want? Stop making the teachers pissed off, I'm telling you.""

Well you actually do, the the first choice you need to make is to ignore toxic teachers like these, and it isn’t “just” ignore them. You need to know that toxic people like this teacher and your bullies in primary school are actively causing harm to you, and you need to cut off any emotional ties ASAP. From what I’ve seen among my peers from primary school to JC, the most accomplished ones always did things their own way. 

> And what the fuck was that about? What's wrong with being different? Oi, we are humans leh. We all have our views and perspectives and you, piece of shit, should learn to respect that shoudn't you? How the fuck are you able to know so much about me to be able to evaluate what's good and what's bad for me so confidently when you barely even know me? Go become a fortune teller lah.

Theres nothing wrong with being different. But unfortunately, many singaporeans have not learnt how to respect different views and perspectives yet. The Straits Times comments section shows this pretty well. This teacher seems to be one of them, so don’t place too much weight on his words.

My advice for you might sound cliche but you really have to stop looking at yourself as a victim.  
  
> Have fun with your mentally handicaped child.  

Thinking that you are mentally handicapped isn't gonna help the situation you are going through, try changing your attitude. You can't do anything about your situation (you can't transfer school, fire your teachers or beat up your classmates) so you have to learn to adapt and just (sadly) do what they ask you to do. Unfortunately, there isn't much room for special snowflakes in Singapore so just try to be normal.

You will have difficulties communicating with most people. However, you you will benefit is so many other ways. Making money is so much easier for people like us.  


2) Be strong. Speak when you feel like speaking, do what you want to do. Live the way you want to live. If people don't like you, so what? Be yourself fearlessly.  


3) Find your own people. There will probably be few people in your life that you can truly click with but they exist. Go and find them. We don't need many friends. Just a few good ones.  


4) Pursue knowledge and wisdom to improve your life. You have a good mind, use it.  


5) This is the most important thing. It is difficult to understand: Learn to see and act in a less objective but more feeling way during social situation. ",4,Mockingbirddd,2018-09-23 02:09:51,9hwsh9
9hwsh9,e6fmdye,"To be quite honest, I was a bit cynical about just how bad the teachers were in your story. A part of me, probably because I have some experience with education in general, said that surely at least one teacher around you is not absolutely dogshit, and that perhaps you are exaggerating a fair bit of the details or that there is a fair bit of confirmation bias on your part.

But then a part of me says ""What if he isnt?"" and so here I am trying to help and to listen and hopefully offer some perspective.

If you need a ear, and I know it is not quite the same because I am not your teacher; if you dont mind giving an educator a shot to help you where others may have let slip, drop me a PM. ",4,dubbuffet,2018-09-23 05:02:46,9hwsh9

Jesus Christ that's just a male form of slut-shaming (I'm assuming you're male? Feel free to correct me). The girl who did that to you deserves no respect. 

Your SAP teachers appear to be really big assholes. Shaming you for helping classmates and verbally abusing you as a form of scolding? That's unwarranted behavior. 

Besides your Dad, do you have your Mom or Siblings to talk to? Or any classmates you currently have that you trust? Talking with someone can alleviate some of the bottled-up emotions you're having. With all the shit you and your classmates have to put up with, y'all deserve better. Something like this should not go unnoticed to the public eye.

A therapist might help you with your social anxiety problems. Due to the fact that you're stuttering it's definitely very severe. 

The only disagreement I have with your post is this part:

>> A woman dresses in a way that exposes lots of skin; a man finds her attractive and rapes her. In court, the woman is sentenced to jail because she was the one that caused the man to rape her.

> \^\^Obviously, this is immoral and wrong, right? Becaue it's the man's choice whether to rape her or not and he has full control over whether to do it or not.

> AND, just like how its 100% the man's choice whether to rape her or not, it is 100% my classmates' choice whether to get influenced by me or not. Why am I being blamed?

I don't honestly think you're a negative infleunce to your classmates. But those who are should be blamed as well. Stating that the negative-influenced are completely at fault is a form of victim-blaming. Negative influencers in the schools may have bad intentions; they encourage students to smoke or do drugs, get wrapped up in gang fights or distract them from their studies. Just as it is the man's fault to rape an innocent woman, so is the bad-influencer's fault for causing problems in the school.

Teachers very rarely threaten dp for the first time, meaning you're likely a repeat offender (of doodling in class) but why are you feeling victimised for this? You're the one at fault here.

""Stop making your teachers pissed off"" probably implies repeat behaviour even across classes. For that same anecdote, ever consider that given your past behaviour that the teacher is justified in thinking you aren't actually teaching her but doing smth else?

The list goes on. These are purely speculations, so I could definitely be wrong and attacking you without a basis, but if ""everyone is out to get you"" and you're so seldom at fault then there's definitely something you're not telling us, or noticing yourself.

9hwsh9,e6gzq1v,"This reminds me of back in primary and secondary school, similar experiences although I never got good grades so more pressure from Le momma, anyway, I hated SG’s competitive nature and hated the fact that you don’t really have much of a say in what you want to do (unless you’re either Sibei good at it, even then it’s not worth unless you ‘aka your family or government’ are earning boatloads of $$$ or fame, e.g Olympic swimmer) 

Teachers don’t really give too much shits once they ascertain you’re either too useless or no potential, I had a Cher that literally yelled at me to give up pure bio in front of the whole class as I was doing terrible in that subject. She was yelling at the entire class for not doing well in general anyway so she was on a roll. Ironically, some of my classmates became teachers so idk if it was just me, I swore never to be like them.

Unfortunately that’s SG’s mentality tho, value through merit, you gotta prove you’re worth it or you’re trash. Either you suck it up and live with it or somehow find something you’re good at and make ppl pay you for it. 

Also unfortunately, I’m one of the lucky ones that got an overseas education, let me tell you, in my honest opinion, I like the less cut-throat atmosphere (I also felt more motivated to actually try harder) there. I know not many Singaporeans are able to ‘escape’ like I did but perhaps when you enter Uni (I have no doubts you’ll definitely make it), you can try to get an overseas exchange gig (will most likely have to either get scholarships [tough but you have to try], or work part time, or do what a friend of mine did and sign a government contract (I think it was 4 years?). I know, I know, why sign your life away? Well if you hate the system, you can have a number of options:

1) live with it and just whine about how bad it is (I do that often)

2) escape to another country that you’ve fallen in love with [in my case, I found my loved one here and I love the weather (not hot and humid)]

3) perhaps the best solution but also the toughest, Join the system and try to change it from the inside. You can either get out of a sinking ship or try to fix it and save the rest of the people onboard.

Either one is up to you, it’s your life after all. Just know that once you’re on your own, your world is your oyster (I never understood that saying). I’m just trying to say that your struggles are real but also temporary. There will always be another day, another struggle, but you’ll find, as you grow older that these issues take lesser priority in your life (I mean seriously, you’ll be more worried about your phone bill or something). 

Last but not least (I’m prob missing a lot of things and also I’m pretty naive in SG stuff, I haven’t been back in a while), go find some friends who have similar hobbies with you, reddit seems to be one way this can happen, join a club or something (I had tons of fun with classmates who played 40k *for the greater good!*)

Ehh, that’s my two cents? I know it’s not saying a lot as I’m lucky to have the means of going overseas but I honestly believe you can be happy after secondary school or school in general.

TL:DR, school sucks, but it’s temporary and these ppl will hardly be in your life again if you so choose. Just keep on living and eventually you’ll find yourself remembering these bad times as a fleeting memory.

9hwsh9,e6h1kcb,"A lot of humans and teachers are idiots. My school had relatively decent teachers, but there were still a few bad ones which I had a few run-ins or poor experiences (nothing terrible).

But I think your real issue might not entirely be with the environment but with your own psychology. There are bullies everywhere in many schools, but they generally only attack those who they sense they can prey on. It seems like you have been traumatised, creating a sense of weakness and worthlessness in yourself that bad people exploit. I would say that the best thing for you is not necessarily to seek a school counseler, but to challenge your own self to be braver, to stand up for yourself, to confront the bullies and their behavior whether they are students or teachers. The counseler may not help, and a school transfer may lead to same problems. But if you gain courage, strength, and respect for yourself, you can deal with any people from any environment.

Looking back, I would have shown much less respect and attention to the bad teachers. If you think they are unreasonable, walk away or ignore them, and if/ when they try to escalate the matter, just explain what happened. You can even dare them to escalate the matter if you think you are in the right. Judging by the way you type, you are probably smarter and more sensible than a lot of the teachers, but psychologically you are used to being in a subordinate/ deferential role which they can see and exploit.

You don't have to please any of them and their unreasonable-ness. There was an episode in JC where a teacher asked for my name after catching me doing something unorthodox (not really wrong or mischievous) and I just ignored her request. Eventually, she tracked me down (she was teaching a class and some of her students knew me) and she acted as if she 'got me', but nothing happened since I didn't even do anything wrong. But this was after I had matured a bit during JC. If I had the same maturity in high school as I have now, I would have been a lot ruder and less deferential to the poor behavior displayed by teachers.

Ok, you might be on the way to depression. Depressed people can look like the most happiest people in the world.. like Robin Williams.

What you need is a goal for yourself, not something that benefits you like lifting weights to look good, learning day trading to make more money for yourself.

You want something that can help you do something for others, maybe go to for volunteer work for old folk or animals. I prefer animals because im a bit cunty sometimes but animals makes me melts.. its hard sometimes to wear gloves to handle dogd cause of religion but its worth those doggy eyes (https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/a37nvk/volunteering-is-the-best-kept-secret-for-mental-health-stressweek2017)

You want to spend time with other people, gaming behind a computer screen is different from board game night with like minded people. Use Eventbrite to see what might interest you and go from there.

Even if you do something or learning by yourself, such as learning the saxophone like i am now, but you need to know it how will that help you mixed with people of similiar interest. Maybe a jam session or something.. thing is to keep learning new things.

Best thing to do when you feel depressed, is not to sleep.. never sleep. You are feeding it... Go for a walk (https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/walk-depression/).. to where? I dont know, just put on your slippers and pick a direction and obey the traffic rules and you be alright.

Routine work for me is something we got to go through, but what we do in the free time is what define us.

And lastly, you also might be a introvert like me. You might think, nah... Im not introverted, im loud and sassy.

Think of it this way, extrovert feels recharged when talking to people and being coup up and alone for too long makes them sad and depressed.
Introverts, get recharged by some alone time but when they need to be the life of the party, they will tap on that charged up source. (https://www.psychotactics.com/the-main-difference-between-extroverts-and-introverts/)

Understand that, you dont have to be or act happy all the time... It will tire you out. If it happens on that day you feeling melancholic, just keep your mouth shut and chill for the time being, other people will understand and once you ready to talk and be a happier version of yourself, You can even say ""sorry, i was a bit tired and lazy to talk just now.. one of those days you know?""

What else.... Stoicism, red pill and mgtows. The last 2 is purely for reading, take these methods with a grain of salt because some of it is Yishun level of crazy (i can make that joke because im from yishun) but there are alot of wisdom in there too... Stay away from incels.

In closing, no tldr and goodluck. You need help to talk about this thing.. just pm me. You dont have to go through life lonely.

The difference between alone and lonely is being alone is being by yourself, being lonely is being in a group of people and still feel alone.",32,ismetrix,2018-10-02 05:06:18,9kflr0

There really doesn't seem to be many avenues for people to start seeking help for their mental health, so I was really glad that there's such a team that I can approach. I basically arranged for an interview with them and they had me sit for a consultation with a psychiatrist. What i liked was that everything that happens there is off the records. Following that, they do give advice on what options you can choose. For me, I agreed on counselling sessions with their team's social worker but I did ultimately ask for a referral to a hospital. They do take into account your preferences (unless they have reason to believe you are in danger). For example, I refused to go to IMH because my sister works there, and I refused SGH because my friend had a terrible experience there. CHAT managed to arrange an appointment with KTPH within 2 weeks (which is surprising fast) and that's where I go to now.

I am not sure what you meant by ""it will take a long time to see a psychologist"" and you talked about your medication. It is likely that you got the terms confused. A psychiatrist is who you are looking for and he will look at you and prescribe your medication. The first line of defence against mental illness in this country is still medication, so if it is urgent and you are running out of medication, you are able to get an immediate referral.

However, the government has always seen psychotherapy and counseling as optional, thus, there are usually not enough psychologists and you will have to wait for an appointment.",1,FahadiHussein,2017-07-26 02:02:34,6pezoy
6pezoy,dm14xqy,"hi! girl who has/had depression anxiety borderline personality disorder and was failed by singapore's mental healthcare but is much better now due to learning to take care of myself and find coping methods + homeopathic remedies:

-tell the polyclinic doctor your symptoms maybe embellish a little to get a sooner appt date. 
-maybe dont go to imh if not necessary (its abit incriminating + asian mindsets + stigma [im an imh patient])
- if super urgent/suicidal and such go to the ER but it probably will be in your records
- re: records, my psychiatrists always told me you dont have to declare them its your privacy unless i mean of course you have psychotic breaks that might happen at work that might cause danger to other people/yourself, my advice is if youre stable dont bother declaring

- geylang polyclinic has ""IMH"" psychiatrists and treatment 

- polyclinics can give basic anxiety meds for sleep if thats what you need

- so far for me i just go to the polyclinic, talk abt my history, they give me a referral and i get one pretty quick

- IMH has 2 clinics, for the wealthy and for everyone else. the ward is actly pretty fking nice lol its like a hotel, theres a gym theatre personal chef silk pyjamas and stuff (just that u have unstable roommates)

- I havent found an IMH doctor thats dedicated and cares, they just did the bare minimum and often were cynical and gave u the old asian tough love kind of care (my doctors were Indian nationals who were super harsh with me when i was fragile and a mess > i gave up cuz they reminded me of my abusive dad > probably shdnt give up and keep trying)

but its not their fault i guess, theres too many and theyre restricted by all the laws and such so they get so cold when treating patients

- mental healthcare system for my sister worked out good tho, shes getting treated for anxiety and used to (and still is) working for govt bodies (now in a different sector)
- bit more difficult if you have a history of suicidal behavious + psychotic breaks (will let u know when i get my shit tgt and embark on a career)
- DONT try ECT unless rly rly rly out of hand, try inpatient and rly rly try everything. had a friend that did ECT at mount alvernia (i think), she had to relearn how to read and write
- local hospitals always have medical social workers to apply for subsidy but sadly its a long process and if you dont fit the income bracket u need to give alot of paper work (maybe show loans of the people u live with to show u need the subsidy)
- local hospitals are good in the sense that u can pay later and say youre in the process of MSW (medical social worker) then you can pay like 10$ or sth first 
- so far my friends with suicidal hospital records to skill related jobs, ive yet to come across someone who has my type of medical records and works for govt so i rly dont know if its incriminating its more of a bitch to explain to recruiters why u have a three year blank of ""doing nothing"" when youre actly in and out of hospitals

A referral from the polyclinic won't take months. It's at most 5 weeks, early if you need urgent medical care. I got mine about 4 weeks after getting a referral. You first get assessed at the polyclinic and do your best to be truthful, do not underplay or overplay yourself. After the assessment you will most likely receive a referral letter. Some clinics have psychiatrists on standby and they can prescribe medication for you while you wait to see a specialist.

Psychologists are the ones that focus on psychotherapy; they talk to you and explore thoughts, feelings, actions and try to help you understand your situation and formulate a plan on how to manage your situation. Psychiatrists tailer and dispense medication for your needs. 

Perhaps public doctors have a bad rep in the past, however, most of the public doctors I've seen are friendly and caring. There's a few bad ones but as an outpatient you can always change doctors. I personally receive great care from them.

Prices are very reasonable too, especially if you're Singaporean & subsidized. Iirc citizens that are in need receive further subsidies; I know of another patient that only pays a few dollars every time they see their docs. If you're strictly going to see a psychiatrist, the price after subsidy and medisave is usually $20-40. If you also see a psychologist at the same time then it is a bit more expensive, an additional $50-70 per session. 

At the topic of prices let's talk about insurance. Mental health insurance in Singapore is next to nothing. I am paying for a top tier medical insurance from Great Eastern and I only manage to claim $5000 yearly for any inpatient costs, and really little for outpatient cost that I don't bother. They need to step up their game. I don't know what medishield helps with but I can imagine it is similar. It's truly sad. 

Alternative options for mental healthcare: 

Private mental healthcare is fantastic here, but expensive. I am fortunate enough to be able to afford seeing a psychologist at Mt Elizabeth, I would recommend it if you can afford it. However, I do get my medication from Queensway Community Clinic. It is part of the IMH umbrella and the doctors there also serve at IMH. It is actually part of the Queensway Polyclinic. The reason I brought this up is because IMH is way too far from where I live (bukit timah). It may be an option for you if you're in a similar geographical situation as me.

NUH, NTFH, GH, CGH all too have a psych department and can dispense medication, and may strike a good balance between IMH and private practices. However slots are limited and I have no experience with them, so I can't comment.

All in all, I feel like if you need serious urgent help, go to their A&E especially if you are suicidal. Let loved ones know of your situation so that you can have support. If not do go the polyclinic route. I wish you the best and if need be, do pm me. Good luck and stay safe :)",10,madfudz,2017-07-26 06:02:21,dkoufqu

Secondly, a colleague once told me that since independence, the government prefers the quick way of sedating the mentally ill through medication, which is why the practice still lingers on today.

3swp8o,cx11mkj,"I think that you should tell your mum's relatives what is going on before making any decisions. That way, they can help your mum alongside you and understand what exactly is happening before passing judgement. If they refuse to listen or if they think you're unfilial (the most common insult/accusation of nearly every Chinese family,) then you know that you shouldn't turn to them for help.

But since they are family, they should be less judgemental and be more willing to listen and help because that is what they are here for. Explain to them what is happening and what has been going on as calmly as you can. It will be hard to remain calm, so you can pause and take deep breaths while telling an aunt before continuing. It is also apparent that this crisis is too big for you to handle alone, so some intervention was in order anyway. 

After communicating with them, it would be useful to come up with an action plan so that as many people who can and are willing to help will lend a hand, and then you can talk about staying somewhere else. Be it staying with an aunt or uncle or moving in with your father, the decision that they help you make should be based on your welfare, and not be coloured by the dislike they feel for your father. At this point, this is all about the emotional well-being of you and your family, not anything about the quarrels in the past.

You should also tell your friends. Even if they can't help you, emotional support is very important. I can't stress this enough because sometimes you need to vent, and it can be depressing if you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to. Your school teachers/counsellors may also be able to help as well to figure out a solution, or to just lend a listening ear.

The other option would be talking to your dad, and to see if he's ok with helping to rent a room for you. I have two cousins who have had to live in dorm rooms (or hostels,) as their mother couldn't care for them anymore due to a mental illness. Perhaps an arrangement like that would help as well.

What I do regret is cutting off our relationship for a time after that happened.  If anything would have happened to her I would have never forgiven myself.  If you can find some way to make it clear to everyone that you still love your mother, but that you can't bear the situation any more and that's the only reason you're leaving, they may be able to come to terms with it.  Especially if it's clear you're still reaching out to her with love and kindness.

Also it's clear that you're extremely frustrated.  If this disagreement is devolving into shouting and high-intensity arguments, consider that your mom is mentally ill and it's up to you to exercise more control over the conversation.  Try to keep a level head even when you're fuming inside.  It's the only way I was able to convince family and friends that I wasn't the crazy one, because I kept a level head about it and explained the situation calmly.  One strategy is the criticism sandwich.  Start by saying something good about her, and how much you love her, then calmly explain your issue, and be sure to end with another kindness before she is able to interject and become upset about what you said.  That goes for any ongoing issues with the hoarding as well as the conversation you may inevitably have about leaving.

3swp8o,cx1j4gk,"hey there,

many people are telling you that your dad is the best shot, but i think it's also important to consider about how well you know your dad's current situation before making a decision.

is he doing well financially? emotionally? mentally?
is he together with another woman? still sleeping around? married with new kids?

it would be best for you to get out from the predicament that you're in without having to find yourself in yet another one. if your dad's current situation is messed up, then it'd be good to consider your relatives who (i assume) you are more familiar with.

what you really need now is a respite from all this stress that you've been shouldering for such a long time, and that can only come from being with healthy family (not meaning no problems, but at least not significantly dysfunctional) with responsible adults who can give you good counsel and a conducive avenue for rehab.

assuming you hope to help your mom get better in time, i think talking to a relative from your maternal side could be the best shot. this is also because you know your cousins well and they'd probably be a lot more hospitable to you than your dad's new woman/family would. your cousins will also be able to lend you much needed emotional support. 

whatever your choice is, try to find a responsible adult to live in with - one that can provide you with a healthy environment to readjust and reconsider how you want to move forward from this. ",5,ehtoboy,2015-11-16 16:50:27,3swp8o

You have two choices. I can sense that you still care a lot about your mother, despite your frustration. You have to stage an intervention. Tell your mother's sisters and get them to make your mother see sense. 

The other option would be to move in with your dad and never look back but I don't think you'll be able to make that decision easily. Sorry things are so hard for you. You seem very resilient actually and I hope you find a solution soon. ",4,,2015-11-16 16:51:19,3swp8o
3swp8o,cx14yt1,"I'm going to be extremely straightforward and practical here, no comforting words. 

First, *cut your loses*, at this point the need to improve your living conditions has far out weights the need to maintain your relationship with your mom and the people around you. 

You have prioritise your alternative living places quite nicely. 

Like the list, if at all possible, you'd dad should be the first and only person you should move in with. It would setting your living space nicely for a few months at least while you try to sort things out at your mom's house. 

However, if you are insistent with staying with your extended family, consider if they can take you in. If you want to approach them about it, contact them and tell them in a straight forward manner. Take a few pictures if your mom's house and message your aunts and uncles if you could meet them at their house in when they are free, explain what is going on with back at your mom's house and show them the pictures to emphasis your problems. See if you can work out a living solution with them from then. 

At this point, there is no reason to hide or put up a facade. Let everyone of your cousin, aunts, and uncles know your problem. This is not something you can handle by yourself anymore, you need a family intervention. 

One more thing, your school boarding school should be your last resort, a contiency plan. I would not recommend living with your friends as it brings a lot of problem and people who don't have to get involved. 

Once you have settle your living space, it's time to get down to business. Your living space may have improved but that doesn't mean your mom has and that should be your next goal. 

I am not really familiar with what to do here but the my idea would be to shift your mom to somewhere first, while they house gets clean up, then let her return to the house and then get her to seek help. At least this way, both you, your bro and your mom have somewhere sanitary to live, while she tires to sort out her mental issues. 

Currently, the first idea I'm thinking if is thag maybe you could get some outside help from family services, but I am also not too familiar with what services there are so I need to do a bit of Googling. 

The other idea is to get your family to help clean up the house and keep your mom away from the house as everyone clean. The only problem with this is that not everyone can sync up their schedules together, and that everyone must agree that something needs to be done to your mom's house. 

So far that's what I can think up of which is kinda as good of a plan as I can come up with without knowing anything personal about you. 

But all I know is that the thing triggered inside of you is the ""fuck this shit, I'm not doing this anymore"" moment. This is the moment when you cut all the negative, no matter the cost. If you need anything, you can PM me. 

Good luck OP, and God speed.

3swp8o,cx1dc4c,"What you need to do now is to calm down. By calm down I do not mean a constant reacting, rushing to make a decision or doing something. You are like in a state of heightened anxious flux right now, going berserk, trying to deal with all the problems at one go. When you are awake, do not do things like deleting the post, then re-posting it again later on. Stop, take a step back, and assess the situation calmly. Only then can people help you.

**Only** viable option is to move in with your dad. It's basically weighing between your sanity and the relationships you have with the relatives on your maternal side. If I were you, I would like to keep my sanity very much thank you. And besides, if your relatives truly care about you, they would eventually see the truth and understand. If they don't, what exactly did you lose? You would have merely lost a bunch of pple who just never ever understand nor care. 

Moving in with an uncle or auntie isn't a long term solution. Moving in with a friend shows that you aren't even thinking straight, if you move in with a friend, your mum may come knocking on your friend's door creating problems for your friend and their family. Begging your school again shows that you haven't thought this through properly. The school is unlikely to allow this to begin with.

All options except moving in with your dad is unlikely to be a long term option.

And as I said at the start, deal with one problem at a time. 

The way I see you describe is, you are trying to solve all the following problems concurrently 
- how your moving out will affect your mum
- what's going to happen to your brother
- how my relatives will think of me 

Just focus on getting sanctuary with your dad for now and you can deal with subsequent problems one at a time later on when things are more settled down.

anyway let an uncle advise you further.

to any problems and finding the solution to it, you need to identify what is going wrong. in the first post, many told you that your mom has depression which i do agree, hoarding is a mental illness if you know.

I actually pity both your parent and of course you and your brother, your dad probably found out that it is impossible for your mom to change that is why he went the easy way out having affair.

your mom being unable to afford things from young and start her hoarding spree is a torrent of unwanted stress and anxiety for your family.

as an engineer... we see problems as no problems.. there are solution but are you strong enough to take it on? i know as a 17 yr old lass, you are suppose to have fun with friends, living in a ordinary house etc but do remember that your case may be out of ordinary but definitely not the worst.

end of the day, are you willing that change? because change is an action not a word of advise, not something you speak but act.

I hope you does! so here are ways of solving this chunk of mess!

* even though you fight with your mom now, doesn't mean that you have to stop reminding her that she need to stop hoarding. like a child, to teach someone is to keep reminding it. you will be damn tired everyday for doing this but if the goal is for a cleaner house, PLEASE DO IT for your sake!

* start packing in small amount of her hoarding junk™ daily, put it in a briefcase and move it to the trash, don't let her see it anyway, if you gonna ask her permission, she won't allow anyway. you want to rid the roaches, you need to do this.

* start clearing your sanctuary first, this is where your peace is, her winter clothes? throw them away! 

* get lemon grass oil or essence, its pretty easy to get it from many places. roaches don't like them so start with your sanctuary, spray it at every corner you have, those accessible area first, then when you cleared up some part of your sanctuary, spray it too. 

* whenever you clear an area, sweep and mop your floor, clean your wall at least, those cracks and gaps you say on the wall? you will need to paint it. these take time and effort everyday a little bit, you will start seeing effect of a cleaner house.

* when these are cleared in your room, fix the broken electronics if you can, if you can't get someone else to help you. you should let your bf know about your situation seriously, this is where you will know if he is a keeper or not anyway.

* your mom would start noticing that some of her stuff being thrown away when you start moving it her stuff in the living room. so this will be the last 2nd item you will do.

* start cleaning the room full of book where the shelf came down. find a way to access it seriously, i'm pretty sure it is the most nasty place you every find, it could be like 10 year of dust and crap inside, be brave man.... 

* donate all these books to schools or whereever they need, if you have the time, do a PDF scan these books or download ebooks just if your mom want it back, tell her new age people don't read books anyway, we have ipads/android/kindles.

* when you finally clean up that room full of books, please start with your kitchen first, you can now get someone into the house to fix the broken stuff like heater, lamp etc. 

* when your mom kpkb about it again, tell her family members of her hoarding personal she has. tell them you need a clean space and you have already clean up that much, you show effort to clean up and proven that your mom indeed has hoarding syndrome. 

* let your mom knows you love her, you didn't side your dad for what he has done to her, tell her that she is breaking you and your brother up because of her hoarding, tell her you don't need all these books/junks, you need her and these junks is a bad memories of your childhood.

A (significant) portion of your mom's alimony is technically ment for you and your brothers upkeep. Your mom is just the custodian of it as both of you are minors. If your mom was found to not be of sound mind then she cant be your legal guardian and manage your finances for you. Now im not a lawyer but im sure there is a mechanism to declare her to be unfit to manage your affairs for you and thus allowing you access to funds you require to move out. Public policy Is highly protective of minors and **im sure some legal industry redditors can point her to some pro bono advice**.

sorry to see this post late, but here's what I would advise, take note that some of what I said will overlap with what others have shared.

The first step you can and should do is to see a MP. The MP can write a letter to HDB and it's possible for them to direct you to a welfare home or homeless shelter. MP letters can carry a lot of weight depending on the situation. They could also refer you to a family service centre where the social workers there might be able to help you, be it financially through Comcare or with the housing issues.

Solve the housing issue thing first, and any other resources you need, I would be able to easily assist. 

But the most important thing I wish to tell you is, do not give up hope. And as much as you resent your dad, and as much as it is a terrible situation for you all these years, I hope that you would be able to choose to not see yourself as a victim and understand that you still have a bright future ahead of you. Yes it may be difficult for you to envision or see that bright future now, but there is as long as you don't give up.

Her mother is unsympathetic, which is lousy parenting, but not a crime. ""But her teacher says so, that's why she got wrong impression."" Eh Auntie, check your facts before scolding your daughter, maybe?

> constantly trying to improve herself by taking notes during class and studying individually at home

Well, yeah. Everyone who wants good grades does this. Self-study, group study session, tuition, at home, at Starbucks.

And my mom retorted her saying she never expected me to be a high flyer, so long as I am happy that's most important. My mom is my idol till today. 

A lot of pressure from schools to outperform on results especially those independent schools where they need to keep their ranking etc. It's almost like a corporate responsibility to answer to the board of directors hence the culture is very brutal. But to be fair, I also had nurturing teachers who wasn't like that. 

Parents need to understand that school today is very different from when they were schooling. The pressure to be a perfect student is outrageous. Every child is different and have strengths and weaknesses like any human being. Why need to emotionally threaten your kid with tears? I am so sorry that your friend has to suffer like that, she is lucky she has you as a friend. Encourage her to be resilient.

9jmtio,e6t0hzv,"In the end, people must find their own strength and conviction to deal with their own problems. Yes, it might not be easy, but this is how things often are (and there is satisfaction overcoming challenges).

The idea that 'things/people' aren't good enough is often a common enough situation that one eventually will run into if they live in society. The problem isn't that there are people who find fault or think you aren't good enough, but that you try to please them and try to live up to their standards. The idea or feeling of 'not being good enough' is often a dysfunctional pattern by itself, and being an ingrained pattern of dissatisfaction, there will never be an outcome where things will ever be good enough. Rich, attractive, famous celebrities crash and burn out on drugs and feel that life is not good enough because life will never be good enough if one holds onto that mentality.

If a person is to live their own life, a life of their own terms and not one of people-pleasing, they have to develop their own strength and courage to be themselves. Your friend now has her teachers and parents telling her that she is not good enough, and when she graduates and goes on to work, she will find employers and colleagues telling her she is not good enough. Is she going to keep feeling terrible and helpless because others tell she is not good enough, or should she develop the strength and inner sense of self-worth to ignore them and have confidence in herself?

***

What your friend should do is to decide that she can no longer be a people-pleaser and that she will do what she feels best for her. If the teacher finds fault and threatens to call her parents, she should say 'go ahead. I have done my best and if my best is not good enough for you, so be it'. And if the mother berates her for being a terrible daughter, she should respond ' I have done my best, and if my best is not good enough for you, so be it'.

No, that's why I said you're either a troll or you are highly intelligent (can't think of a better word) for your age.

It's statistically way more likely that you are a troll in reddit. But after looking at your post history I'm convinced you are who you say you are.

I actually identify somewhat with what you are going through as I attended the GEP and my friends and I faced some situations similar to yours (didn't get particularly stressed about PSLE because my parents assured me that they didn't care but gave me shit after I got 269, etc) 

Singaporeans are generally rigid in their thinking and will dismiss your thoughts due to your age. You need to find an adult IRL who doesn't immediately dismiss you that you can discuss your situation with and seek advice from. Ideally your school should have a teacher or someone like that as well, eg a school counselor or something. Otherwise you can pm me if you want to chat. I can understand how it's hard to trust someone in your situation after getting shit on many times but the sad truth is without you parents or a teacher to champion you you basically have no way to address your situation. 

I read your ""school is killing me"" post. 

It seems like you are depressed and have not been able to seek help? Have you talked to your parents about it? Otherwise, you should definitely speak to someone in your school about it. You can pm me anytime if you want to discuss your options.

>EDIT: Yes I am studying in what everyone calls a ""top school"". SAP school, IP programme.

8e3zfy,dxt3gtb,"Do consider maintaining a ""side hustle"" while working a regular job. Many here are recommending a fastfood job, but you mentioned that you have a knack for assembling PCs. I feel this is a service you can market and slowly grow via social media and word-of-mouth. 

In fact you can expand the scope to include smaller jobs such as video card upgrade installation, or hard drive replacement, etc. 

What I'm getting at is to put your eggs in other baskets when you can. While doing so may not be entirely successful, it will open up new paths for your life to take. Thereby giving you more and better options to upgrade your situation. 

Some good tips on starting a side-hustle here: https://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/07/30/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-i-confronting-your-objections/ ",4,gentlemansincebirth,2018-04-23 17:44:10,8e3zfy
8e3zfy,dxt5swu,"You need a few things. 

1) Your hearing problem is pretty much the cause of everything. You should seek medical advice asap. At the same time, look for the social work / financial assistance office to see if you can get some subsidies for medical treatment. You need to get it treated because hearing is important for yourself and also for any future studies and work. 

2) You need money. Either from starting a business, or from a job (full time or part time). Some sort of finances. Your highest education is PSLE and this limits the potential range of jobs you can do. You need to think of a way to solve this fast. In short, you need to improve yourself in order to get better work opportunities. 

Communication is important in many jobs and social interactions. Hearing difficulties will be a big problem because if you can't understand others, it will be hard to respond. This will not only affect your education but also work with colleagues. 

Once your get some sort of income, seriously consider going back to school or take up a course somewhere. Your passion is in IT, however, IT requires specialized skill sets. It is not something that you can easily pick up. Others have spent years and years in education on it. 

3)  Work out a plan for your family's finances. Working in a fast food, or anywhere else at the moment will be a challenge for you. If you actually have to feed your entire family, the income from such jobs is insufficient. The hard truth would be that even if it means that you have a job, you will not be able to provide sufficiently for your family. Maybe you will barely be able to provide by working long and hard hours, at the cost of your health. But you will get older, and your body weaker. It is a natural part of life and by then, you may be too old to learn and not as strong as before. You will be stuck on the treadmill running towards the next pay check for your entire life. And by that time, it may not be enough. 

Try to see how much leeway you can get. How much income would you barely need and set aside the rest for self improvement. There is this skillsfuture thing right now and I suggest looking at the website and speak to one of the operators or what to see how they can assist you. 

4) Other forms of work. There are some online work which communicate via email or text which means you actually dont need to ""hear"" your clients. You can be a freelance designer, coder, translator etc etc. 

5) Have you been through NS? You can consider going to NS. Because of your hearing problem, you will most likely be a non combat vocation. You get some allowance and your family would have one less mouth to feed for 2 years. You can scrimp and save and use that time to think on how to improve your situation. Education / technical courses is the only way forward. (Unless you have a knack for business) ",5,Vyrena,2018-04-23 18:29:20,8e3zfy

I didn't drop out of secondary school, but through a combination of laziness and depression, I did really badly for o levels, and barely got into a diploma I have near to no interest in. 


Right now, I really want to drop out, go do NS, then try to enroll in another diploma. But that would create so much trouble for everyone... My parents... Me.... My parents. 


I hate having to make all these decisions and I don't even know if they're the right ones. I feel like I'm not equipped to handle this stupid life.

Apart from that, do have a serious talk with her about how much You love her. Assure her on how much she means to You. Slowly ease into telling her how much it hurts You to see her hurt herself but mention the fact that if she ever intentionally hurt herself because of an argument with You, you'll be even more angry and upset. 

Explain to her that for her to be able to accept that you love her, she has to learn to love herself more. Also know that, it's hard to stop cutting yourself but small steps do play a part in helping. For example, getting rid of the blades that she use. Ask her and make her dump the blade away into the rubbish bin or chute where she can never retrieve. As much as You think it doesn't matter, it's symbolic and it affects her psychological. Also, I'm guessing her cuts look like llllllll on the wrist? Do note that if a person wants to kill themselves, they will cut like this ""_______""
I'm hoping it's the first one so at least You know she's not too far gone yet.

Lastly, explain to her what she is doing is emotional blackmail and how if she keeps doing this, one day You will not be able to take it and you will walk away. After telling her all of these, assure her that You still love her very much and that You want to be there for her every step of the way for her to be a happier and healthier version of herself.

Good intentions and love are fantastic but when it comes to psychological issues and self harm, sometimes you have to accept that she might need professional help. I wouldn't pressure her into it, let her know that you're there for her always, but also that it's a serious problem and there are professionals who can help her far better than you can.",8,dekonig,2015-09-16 00:09:13,3kze30
3kze30,cv2686s,"She needs to figure out a healthier way to distract herself. Maybe going for a walk, writing, drawing, singing, cooking? (There are other ways to get a dose of endorphins.)

Explain that you understand that she's got her own way of dealing with emotional anguish, but it's not healthy, & it worries you. Be patient when you're talking to her. Show her that you're concerned, not that what she's doing displeases you. Listen to what she has to say, then suggest a healthier alternative.

It's not going to be easy because she's been cutting for a while, & to her, it's a tested & proven method of coping.

Having said all of that, don't be an emotional hostage in your own relationship. I know it's horrible to have to live with that fear, but there's not much you can do really. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

What you can do for yourself, is to not feel responsible when she chooses to hurt herself. & if all else fails, like /u/dekonig mentioned, get her to seek professional help.

3kze30,cv2dtmq,"Short reply due to using phone. 

Those who cut, do so to help themselves feel the pain.They do not know how to deal with/express the emotional pain they feel inside, thus they cut in order to feel the physical pain instead. When you argue with your gf, she feels hurt, she feels pain, turmoil inside, but she doesn't know how to cope with it. Cutting herself makes her pain feel real. 

From what you have described, what your girlfriend needs is a counselor/therapist to help her work through her emotional issues. 

As for yourself, if you are having some form of anxiety disorder, it's really rather a bad combination. Because to deal with someone who self-harms, you need patience, and you need to be able to actually accept her in spite of the fact that she's cutting herself. You need to be able to listen, be calm even if you know she's cutting herself. You need to know that this is NOT an attention-seeking attempt as much as what others might say. And no, she is not doing this as an easy way out. She doesn't know how else to cope.

Bear in mind that as her partner, you are NOT her therapist. You are not here to fix her. You are here to love her, that means accepting her, helping her to get help from professional sources. This means that you do not have to feel inadequate even though it's a natural feeling to have, because it was never your responsibility to solve.

The feelings of anger/frustration is understandable, but however, actions resulting from anger/rage is counterproductive. 

Your own anger merely stems from your own feelings of inadequacy. See things in a different paradigm, and you will be able to deal with this better.

She often tells me she's ""only alive because of me"". I've brought it up to her but she is helpless in trying to change, and so am I. I can hope that with enough love and encouragement she will grow to love herself and know that she herself is worth living for.

I do constantly express my love with words and actions, and whenever I sense any doubt on her side, I am quick to address it. I know she knows I love her, and from this recent incident, she knows I'll get mad and upset if she hurts herself. (Though I don't think she understand the pain I feel)

Yes, she cuts like ""||||||"", and I know she has no intention to end her life. When I first found out, I was unable to get her to get rid of the blade, but in a spur of anger I snapped at her to listen to me, and she did. After speaking to her again yesterday, she has assured me that she will not cut herself again unless we break, which is far from what is desired. However, after much being firm on my side, she has agreed to seek professional help if she ever cuts again.

I did mention that I feel like she's holding me emotional hostage, although I cannot bring up the part about me being unable to take it and walking away if this continues. She has made it clear she'll face suicidal thoughts if I leave, and I don't want her to deal with the feeling that she may face such pain in future.

Secondly, I went through a similar case with my SO before. SO actually sat over a ledge while I was sleeping. SCDF and SPF were alerted and came to the scene. However, SO decided against acting on those thoughts, and came back to the house before SCDF and SPF could find who it was on the ledge. I convinced SO to admit to officers at the scene, because:

1. They would definitely investigate thoroughly and it would almost be certain they would find out who it was on that ledge, as my neighbourhood had many CCTVs.

2. SO would likely be dealt with more harshly if admission of guilt was not ASAP, as it was impossible to miss the presence of SCDF and SPF at the scene and therefore it would almost definitely be counted against her when considering the case. 

So SO admitted to officers at the scene, and I accompanied her to the psych review and was released on the same day. We both had to give statements, separately. Thereafter, SO had to report regularly to police station, akin to probation. After a few months, SO was let off with a formal warning and no repercussions since.

My absolutely serious takeaway for anyone in this thread is that if faced with someone contemplating suicide to talk, visit, call, interfere with their plans. Its not a life time commitment. In the two cases I personally have been involved in, one took a 5 minute call to her family to go and talk to her and the other I personally called the guy and spoke to him.

7x10na,du65gjx,"This is something anxiety does. Whether or not something actually happened, someone with severe anxiety would usually have something on their minds that can make them uncomfortable with confrontation, panicky or easily frightened. 


What they think about may not actually be anything bad, but it can be something that bothers them greatly; Say, forgetting whether the stove at home was switched off and there isn't anyone who could check for you while you're unable to return. In this example, this is a bad situation that happened, but people with anxiety would feel this with a lot more situations, like making phone calls, deciding what to eat or entering an elevator alone with a stranger.


It may sound silly to worry excessively over something that may not be real or negative to most people, but they are extremely real and potentially horrifying to the individual. If something drastic happens (like OP here, who had to face civilian figures of authority for some reason), the anxiety will be amplified and may drive someone to do something needlessly drastic because of fear.

I would point you towards school counsellors, but you mentioned work so I don't think you're in school...? I did a little bit of research on this topic last year, actually, and here's an email I dug out:

> We usually charge an hourly fee of $20 if you are not working.  Our website is www.counsel.org.sg and you can get more information about our Centre and the services we offer before making a decision to see one of our therapists.    We usually recommend 3-4 sessions to feel you are being helped.  Ours is on a fortnightly basis. 
>  
> You are at liberty to stop sessions whenever you want to – even after one session if you assess that your issue for the moment is resolved or you won’t find it helpful if you were to continue.

Oogachaga also offers counselling at $60/hr - they have couples/family sessions for $80/hr. If you let them know that you have trouble paying I believe they will offer lower rates. I'm not sure how related this is to your problems, but they also ""operate a free hotline specialized in dealing with LGBTQ issues as well. Thus, you may call 6226 2002 to reach any of our hotline volunteers. Our hotline operates on Tue, Wed & Thur, from 7p.m. to 10p.m. and on Sat from 2p.m. to 6p.m.""

The hospitals also have psychiatry departments with clinicians. I don't know how much they charge. A friend of mine sees someone at NUH, I think. I would suggest your intake appointment be with a psychiatrist, just so that they can determine if you might be better helped by medication in addition to therapy/counselling.

I feel you on the cost thing - it's ridiculous that such an essential service costs so much. I would suggest you always try to explain your situation - counselling is social work after all, and I know that many therapists see clients on a sliding scale based on how much they can afford. So explain that you have limited funds and see how they respond.

Something about time, though: therapy 'hours' are usually 45-50 minutes long (at least in the US where I have more experience with this) so you might not have to leave work as early as you think.

The most helpful thing I've encountered in mental health is to **be kind to yourself**. Recovery takes time, like recovering from any other illness - and it's a slow process, and there will be times when it feels like you've taken one step forwards and two steps back. So be kind to yourself. And keep us posted. (Another helpful thing: keeping track of your progress, especially during counselling. Writing, in general, is good - as long as you don't do it too much and go into what's called ""depressive rumination"" [google it])

One last word regarding freezing up - I know EXACTLY what that's like. When I first decided to finally try and talk to people (out loud, not online) about feeling down, I would open my mouth and try really hard and literally *nothing* would come out and I would feel so frustrated...I know it's terrifying sometimes to have to talk and explain yourself. That's fine. Opening up is hard, and it takes practice. 

Oh! Another thing: if your therapist isn't actually helpful and there's no improvement after 4-ish sessions, or you're consistently leaving sessions feeling worse than when you came in, feel free to ask for a referral and change. They won't be offended, and you won't be wasting money with someone who isn't helping you get better.

I really hope you find something that works for you. Feel free to message me with follow-up.

215yvd,cgaihf4,"Given cost is an issue, I would agree with quietowlet's suggestion to get a referral from the polyclinic. They may refer you either to IMH or a satellite clinic.  As s/he points out, getting to the head of the queue may take some time, so remember to mention your thoughts of self-harm.

While you're waiting, your local family service centre (Comcare helpline can help connect you - 18002220000) may be able to provide support. Services are usually free/low cost.

If things get to a point that you think you might act on your thoughts to hurt yourself, walk into IMH A&E.  They are open 24/7.  Mention to the MO along the way that you'll need the MSW to help. How much they are able to assist will depend on your particular circumstances.

Finally, kudos for getting help.  Unfortunately, as others have observed, not every professional helper is going to be right for everyone.  You may have to be persistent to get the help that you need.  Best wishes for your recovery!",2,mouseytung,2014-03-25 04:56:39,215yvd
215yvd,cga8b2z,"Your symptoms are textbook bipolar disorder, formerly known as maniac-depressive disorder because your up phases are known as ""maniac"" while your down phases are ""depressive"".  Many great people have suffered from bipolarity, especially those who are artistically inclined: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_bipolar_disorder

Yes, you _should_ see someone professionally.  However, it's not easy to do so in Singapore, especially if cost is an issue.  A good start may be simply to just start opening up to some of your friends, especially those who have a history of being good listeners without a need to jump in with inane, dismissive comments every other sentence.  You don't have to get to the root of the problem in these initial sessions: just say that you've been not really feeling yourself these days, that something's out of sorts, that you just want someone to talk to, and see how they react.  If they seem open and willing to listen, see if you can talk about it, in a roundabout peripheral way.

Of course, not everyone is blessed enough to have such friends.  If things get really bad, consider just going to a polyclinic and asking a doctor for a referral or some other options.  Most medical doctors should have protocol and procedure that they follow when they see a patient with mental problems, and they may be able to point you in the right direction.

Finally, don't feel ashamed that you have this problem.  You're most certainly not alone.  In fact, if anything you're in illustrious company, as the wikipedia page will tell you.  Seeking help for this condition is no more shameful than going to the doctor because you have a cold: it's no more or less a medical condition than a flu.  Chin up!

When I was on the way to a relapse, I went with IMH. It's around $30 with subsidy. Since cost is a big factor, you might want to consider this, but it will take time before you can schedule an appointment (it was a month's wait for me). Make sure you get referral from a polyclinic. You can get an appointment without a referral, but it's going to be more expensive.",1,quietowlet,2014-03-24 21:05:01,215yvd

As someone here suggested, get yourself to a polyclinic asap, tell the doctor how you feel and say want a referral to imh, the polyclinic will liaise with imh to fix an appointment for you.

Once at imh, you'll speak to the equivalent of a general doctor there first and be given a diagnosis before being matched to a particular clinic to treat you.

I think such a consultation at imh will only set you back $30+

To not be more flexible. I was conditioned to be a rather inflexible person (family issues), unable to adapt well to different environments. This has caused me to be socially impaired, and has limited my capabilities.

2. Getting pressured into applying for US uni when i didnt want to

Sure it has shaped me and allowed me to grow into the person who I am today.

But I was also depressed, overworked, and too stressed out for my own good. I have a problem saying no. Join debates again even though I had already wanted to leave the scene to make up for 3 man team? Yeah ok why not. Hi can you join us in this math competition? Ok sure thing bro, anything for a friend. Hi can you help us emcee our CCA concert? Yeah alright i love doing it anyway

With so many commitments. I had to force myself to study for a week before promos in J1. I had already skipped midyears so everything would be weighted on promos.

By the time J1 was over I knew I burnt out. But it was too late to back out tbh. I had already made too many commitments that would carry over to the next year. Everyday in April and May I went home past 10pm due to rehearsals/preparation for competitions/competitions/external workshops

To compensate I studied from 8-8 for a month before Prelims in July, then after a week break studied from 8 to past 10 in school everyday. On weekends Id go to the library or en empty CCA room in my secondary school. 

Burnt out. Wasnt fun. Didnt have time to myself to enjoy what I wanted to do.

2. I also got caught up being pressured by all my teachers to apply to a foreign Uni. Did my SATs for $110, applied to 4 unis for $80 each halfheartedly knowing that if i didnt get a scholarship that I didnt really want I wouldnt be able to afford it.

I chickened out of applying for the scholarship due to my indecisiveness but I had already applied for the unis. The worst part was that I had actually gotten accepted into Yale. But I didnt tell anyone that I rejected it for SMU because everyone would question and question and I just didnt want people to know that I wasted all of my parents and teachers and mentors time trying to apply to a foreign Uni to only reject it. My parents are getting old so I wanted to stay at home. But more than that I cant let them pay for my uni fees either. Its insanely more than we are able to afford including accomodation and food. Felt easier to just say I got rejected from everything instead of the full story.

And out of the full lecture room of people apparently applying to US unis from my JC.

I have had many regrets, mostly due to my rash nature what with my ADHD and lack of self-awareness to cope with it (I mean even my parents refused to let me see a psych till I was in JC because they always thought I was just making excuses to be lazy)

Here are some of the main ones

1) not pressuring my parents into letting me get help for my ADHD sooner. Parents: if your child is telling you to let them see a psychiatrist something is usually very wrong and you are probably too blind/disbelieving to see it. Cos of it I couldnt get help for my annoying behaviour and consistent lack of focus early and my early school life was not the greatest

2) not transferring to a different primary school. The all-boys primary school I went to had a culture that rejected my type of person and I have a feeling that a change of environment would have been immensly helpful in shaping who I was and am

3) not applying for sst or any enrichment programs in my secondary school. As i had/still have a deep interest in doing cool things for the sake of doing cool things for fun SST's curriculum wouldve helped me kickstart my venturing into learning things like programming and robotics early. Similar goes for secondary school enrichment programs but more for biotech stuff

4) screwing up the Band SYF in secondary school. Cant really say much more lest I dox myself more than I already have but lets just say I played when I didnt have to for which I still cant explain why and fked things up for everyone. We got a silver that year and I still have nightmares about it to this day

5) Not going on the japanese exchange trip with the band. Going to japan last year really opened my eyes to the concept of culture, respect and doing things for the sake of tradition, concepts I could never really grasp till then. If I had gone back when I was still early in secondary school maybe I wouldnt have continued being such a shithead

6) being a cunt to female classmates when I was in lower sec. After 6 years surrounded my guys I was pretty freaked out interacting with females my age back in sec 1 and people knew that. So there was this joke where people shipped me and this random girl that apparently said she liked me or something but somehow I came to the conclusion to act like shit towards her. Yeah I also get cringy nightmares about this

7) not taking physics in secondary school. I had quite a but of interest in physics, heck I study it in my spare time nowadays but back then a bad experience with a science teacher in lower sec caused me to not take physics back then and I instead took bio. Regret it quite a bit cos I had to then learn everything on my own time in addition to mugging bio which was the main reason for my name

8) not joining a sports cca in primary school. I distinctly remember I used to be an active person who enjoyed running but my parents never really had the time to take me outdoors and I just settled into a sedentary lifestyle before primary school. However in primary school I had 2 distinct opportunities to be in sports ccas I enjoyed : Tennis and softball. However I quit tennis for who knows what stupid reason and I was too lazy/scared to look for the teacher in charge of softball. Now here I am learning softball independently and trying my damndest to try and becoming healthy again

Dammit Im only 18 and yet I have made too many regrets, many of which still keep me awake at night or send me into panic attacks but I guess theyre better than simple lack of initiative as I can still learn from them :/",2,Muggerchugger,2018-02-05 07:12:43,7v33d2

5eq1v7,daei4mg,"Sorry to say that you can't magically give a person purpose in life. That is the one thing that everyone needs but everyone needs to find on their own.

From your description of your mother now and previously, she probably suffers from some mental condition (depression, anxiety, confusion). You need to seek some medical help in identifying it. To 'take care' of your parents is a huge burden and there is no room for half-ass effort so I urge you to consider seriously if you want to get involved.

With the proper help I think your mother's condition would improve (much effort and time required on your part). However, this is also related to what you want to do in life. Most important thing is to reduce the amount of regrets you have there is just no way to do everything.

If you do not feel like helping your mother overcome her issues, you can help your brother. Talk to him often, make sure he isn't stressed or depressed. If the environment is stressful or abusive he could end up with mental issues as well.

I feel blessed as my parents are doing everything for me and I have never had such issues even while working now. I hope everything works out well for your family.",31,nova9001,2016-11-25 17:03:53,5eq1v7

If she is threatening suicide, please report it to the police for handling. (Suicide attempts are illegal.) If she follows through it is not your fault. YOu will need to slowly disconnect her from your life to properly heal. We have choices. If you want to help her, you could alert her church pastor and inform him before hand you will not help her in any other way.

5eq1v7,dagcgif,"Glad to hear you made it out. It is never easy to leave a toxic home, especially when you've lived in it for almost all your life- for better or worse you'll always carry some of its poison within you. But now that you're out, it will never be able to eat you alive the way it would have if you were still stuck in that miasma. Never go back. Love does not mean wasting away together.

About your mother, there is little you can do to help her find a new purpose in life. You can think of her like an empty glass filled to the brim with the toxic thoughts and emotions that have been eating away that your family for years. For her to find new purpose, she will first have to pour away those thoughts, the anger and blame towards your father, and her fixation on having absolute control over the events and people in her life.

You cannot fill her with purpose when she is already full of resentment and unhappiness. There is no space in her heart or mind for your intentions, no matter how good. And although she doesn't necessarily have to pour everything bad away to find space for good, there would be an inevitable corrupting influence if she persists in holding on to those toxic thoughts. It will warp any positive changes in her life to feed the negative, and that is meaningless to you as her daughter.

Again my advice to you would be the same. Love and support your Mother as far as you can, without being consumed by her. You do not have to accept the things that she does, but accept her for better or worse and find it in your heart to love her as she is. There is little you can do to change her at this point save dragging her by force to a doctor. And that may not necessarily bring positive change as is the problem with mental disorders- the patient has to participate out of their own free will rather than feigning compliance just to better manipulate the good intentions of loved ones. She has to make the choice for herself or it will never work.

As for your brother, communicate with him, daily if possible. When you were there to share the burden with him, he could have a moment or two to breathe. But now that he is alone there, there is no rest from her overwhelming influence. 

Humans are not made to function under constant pressure, and everyone has a breaking point. Having someone to talk to, and share the burden relieves the pressure a little, and that puts off the boiling point for a little longer. So talk with him (ask him about his day, how he is coping, and if he is doing ok), and if he is receptive, encourage him to talk with your Dad as well. 

There is nothing like the relief of knowing you have someone (financially AND emotionally) stable to rely on when things go bad. Now more than ever, you have to remind him that there is someone who CAN and WILL catch him when he falls. Do not let him get sucked in too deep, or to forget that he has other family he can rely on. 

It can be terrifying to feel like you're the only one holding things together, that sort of fear can paralyse you and stop you from verbalising your own personal problems out of fear that everything around you will collapse if you show one bit of weakness. He is just a kid, and shouldn't feel like he has the world on his shoulders. Remind him that he is just that- a kid, and that he can and should find help if he really needs it (even if it isn't from you or your dad) rather than trying to bottle everything up.

Nothing more I can add, but I hope things work out for you and your brother. Everyone has their own respective lives to live, if you (or your brother) suspend your lives to allow your mother's to continue, in a way you are killing yourself to let her lead her's. That is no answer either.

Regrets abound either way, a wasted life is the result at either end. However both you and your brother's cups are still empty enough to be filled with something better, and her's is way too full to be receptive to anything else. There is no blame for whatever choice you make, and imo the desire to live your own life is not something that a mother should ever punish her child for having.",2,dungalot,2016-11-27 07:36:50,5eq1v7

Stay close to him and let him see that there is a good life for him when he is older. Invite him to your place now and then too if that is possible and let him feel what family life should be even.

Yea try not to make your mother jump to her death but your long term priority should always be the well being of your brother.

Honestly speaking, there is nothing much u can do about ur mum. Her current state is a result of years of slight mental instability or depression and habits. I think u should focus on ur brother and urself.

First of all, staying in campus gives u more freedom and less room for tension, this might help improve ur relationship with ur mum if you do go back home once awhile. Just endure the short stay at home and try to please her when u are back. One important thing is make sure that you are eligible for hall stay in the next following years. Not sure u are in ntu or nus but most halls require u to participate in activities in order to stay next yr. Also rmb to make friends in hall so that you got company and emotional support. Although i understand it would be hard to talk to ur frens about this issue, but maybe one day u will get a fren that is close enough to share this burden.

Next, do talk to ur brother more often, thru phone or whatsapp so that he wont feel that he is alone in this demise while his sister has left him for ""safety"". I worry alot about his emotional state, as his current age is most susceptible to bad influence. Especially if he found accompany with a wrong group fren outside. And try to find opportunity for ur brother to attending boarding school. This would be better than ask him to seek refuge from ur dad. Although this might take away one of the remaining emotional support for ur mum. But i think having a church would still provide sufficient spiritual support. As both u and ur brother has and is experiencing the same situation, dun be afraid to open up more to each other about how u feel about the state of the family and ur mother. (not sure how close u are woth ur brother) Anyway, ur brother is old enough to has his own opinion on the issue so do listen to how he feels about it.

5eq1v7,daf8cf0,"Good on you for overcoming what you have and doing well in your studies. First of all, you are not alone. You're dealing with a lot for a young person and it is important to take care of yourself so you don't burn out or manifest deeper issues later on in life in your own relationships and marriage. For now, focus on you. Get counseling for yourself. See a professional who can reflect back to you in a healthy and supportive way so you can find mental and emotional balance and not have to put on a tough front all the time as a scholar and a big sister. It is very important that you do this, and pm me if you need help getting connected with some resources. 

Hoarding is an epidemic also in Singapore, the materialism and culture of competition and lack, zero sum mindsets, all promote this so much that many times it is not even acknowledged as a serious issue. Maybe your or your mum's purpose in life is to ultimately create support groups for recovering hoarders or liberate is all from the traps of material possessions, I don't know, and you are right because in this whole challenge therein lies your purpose and destiny. So seek it out and be patient with yourself. Small steps and little battles. Go easy on yourself, don't put so much pressure on having to get straight As because by golly you have a lot to deal with. And have fun and relax as much as you can. When your mother sees you thriving and relaxed she will begin to relax also. Maybe not anytime soon but people do mellow out as they age. Hope is on your side.

Apart from OCD, has she been diagnosed with any other mental illnesses? It sounds like she suffers from manic episodes, and a fair amount of paranoia. Note: I'm not trying to diagnose her, just pointing out what I think based on the behaviors you described.

I recommend bringing her to a mental health professional for assessment, if you can. With her behavior and all, I don't think it would be a great idea to bring this up to her, so you might have to get the police involved and tell them everything that has been happening. I doubt there would be legal repercussions, but just make sure that when they're involved, tell them you'd like to get help for her. There's an A&E in IMH, which you can bring her to in an ambulance (in restraints, if necessary).

4rq82j,d5523sv,"I posted earlier yesterday but mostly just a short reply. Now that I have more time, I'll give you a more detailed response.

In all your post, you did not mention about your mum. Your dad's depression condition and his passive attitude towards the situation strikes across to me that your mum is no longer in your family's life, be it physically or emotionally somehow. I could be wrong but that's what I'm sensing.

I am more concerned about you than your sister. For your sister, the issue is simply a matter of getting her professional/medical help, ie. seeing a psychiatrist and getting meds. As I advised earlier, if your dad isn't willing to do anything due to finance issues or whatever, you should approach a social worker at the nearest Family Service Centre and ask for counsel on this situation. Alternatively as /u/muachee has mentioned, go to SAMH (Singapore Association of Mental Health) and seek help there. 

But when it comes to you, you mentioned that you dropped out of JC. You sound like you are trying to retake A levels as a private candidate from your post. You mentioned that you have no one to talk to. This is not good. You need to have friends who can be there for you and support you. With all that's happening at home, the last thing you should be doing is to close yourself off trying to fend for life on your own. *You are not alone*

You have already taken the courage to seek help here. Go one step further, help yourself, get support so that you can walk this world with a more emotionally stable footing. 

My offer still stands. If you need a listening ear or support to walk you through this period of time, you are always welcomed to drop me a message.",7,Hope83,2016-07-09 17:37:35,4rq82j
4rq82j,d53rws3,"Hi OP,  Agree with other posters, this sounds like paranoia and psychosis. Had experience with mentally ill family member with similar psychotic episode. Strongly suggest getting her into IMH for treatment cos it sounds serious. She could be a danger to others or herself. 

Here's what I know from personal experience. 

You can call 1777 for non emergency ambulance to your house to take her to IMH's A&E. Emphasise the fact that she's physically hurting your family members and yourself so there's a danger. Ambulance staff will try to persuade her first but if not they will physically restrain her (strap her on stretcher etc) if she keeps being violent. 

If she's likely to turn violent or refuse to open the door, you need to get police involved to help. I didn't need to get police, but got some other relatives to ""act"" as if they are visiting the house. Mentally ill family member opened the door to let them in and BAM. It took some trickery or persuasion to get them to go without a struggle, including we had to act along with their hallucination. YMMV. 

There is a law that allow you to forcefully commit your family member who is mentally unsound for psychiatric treatment, if they refuse to do so. Not so sure about the finer details but your parents may need to be the ones instead of you. I didn't have to use it but I discussed it with IMH doctors on the possibility. My family member ended up being cooperative in staying in IMH after a while when the psychotic drugs started working. 

Singapore Association of Mental Health has a good helpline u can call for advice. I did that. They also have very good counselling and support services (support groups, advice) for family members who are affected by a loved one with mental illness. I used their support services a LOT and it was very helpful. Pls give them a try and persuade ur dad.",12,,2016-07-08 19:12:36,4rq82j

The other day he threatened to kill me because of something I said. I couldn't sleep last night as well. I know I'm not as bad as you but I feel helpless too. I just try to work long hours and get out of the house.

Put your personal safety and well-being first, always. If you find that it's best to get her hospitalised for YOUR sanity and well-being, sure take the plunge. If having somewhere else to go where you can avoid her and siam far far is better for you in the short term, go ahead. 

It's very tough to have a family member who is mentally ill, especially when you are stuck in the same house and other family members kind of give up and don't want to do anything. Don't feel bad if you sometimes feel so desperate you just want to pack up and run away and never go back. Or if you just get so angry at your sister and also your dad. Or you doubt/blame yourself. It's a lot of complicated feelings. It is best to get some counselling for yourself to sort it out when you feel ready to open up. I heard that SAMH is able to offer some free/subsidized counselling if you really have financial difficulty, check with them if you get in touch.

I also want to encourage you that things do get better in the long run. Either you will be able to find the means to move out, avoiding her completely, or maybe sending her to IMH and treatment has some effect so things calm down at home. Many times I just wanted to run away from home cos I didn't feel like I could handle my family member and commit them to IMH. But they started being worse like running out in the middle of the night then disappearing for hours, throw their money away (literally) or nearly getting knocked down by traffic. Thats when I told myself I had to try the IMH and ambulance route. It was damn scary but few years later now? I am so glad I did it.

My brother graduated from sim full time with a rather general degree in management in the worst employment period known in Singapore. One year he works contract at ntuc income earning 1600.

Now he is earning 7000, with good cash flow to manage a stable life. 

The degree is an entry point. If you cannot take a similar high paying job as a start, what is wrong with that? Are you not willing to work harder than the nus ntu grad to rank higher? 

Just accept the chance to prove yourself an learn what is important : the competency. If you get good your reputation develops. 

Future job depends on you reputation as a good worker, leader.  sometimes your starting base is low and you have to accept to work harder (or is that not what you want)

I work in a segment where we take in sim, private degree folks and ex regulars.  

Those who become managers became managers not because of their degree but how they seperate themselves. They have humility to learn, open to ideas, stoic. 

Those that move on enjoy great careers because they have a good rep and keep in touch with friends in the same industry or silo. 

To me if a degree is an entry point, sign on and a private degree is a great option because at 25 you end up without debt versus some local uni grad without support from parents. 

All these stuff does not matter so much if you do not manage your wealth well. If this area is new to you, you might eventually be chasing an income that burns you out. 

Your question should be sign on what vocation. 

Your question should be this is my ideal track: I want to sign on for 6 years come out, go into x industry doing this or this, critique my plan 

Your question should be how many of you start from a low salary and eventually end up well. What are the actions and reflections that impact the most ",1,kyith,2016-05-16 17:12:24,4jbk44

I have many private uni grads in my firm (me included as mentioned) it's not a factor that stops people from hiring you, especially if you have straight A's or good grades - it shows your calibre.

Secondly, unisim is a newly established university, so employers' perception of it is definitely not gonna be as positive as NTU.

4jbk44,d3711pf,"You need to open up your mind and see the synergies between a mathematical degree and what there is in the real world.

For example, take statistics, do well in it, take up coding from codeacademy and you essentially will be armed with the right skills for the data analytics/management boom coming in 3-5 years. 

Don't limit your mind to thinking that whether you study has to relate to what you work in the future. I have engineering friends doing marketing roles, bio engineering friends doing supply chain roles, so on and so forth. University trains critical thinking. It may correlate with what you do in the future, but it is definitely not a causality. 

You have clearly made many bad life choices to end up with a sub-optimal A level results that have landed you in this current circumstance. I would strongly advise you to take the NTU math degree, work hard at it, get first class and do extra curricular learning/clubs to increase your own value. 

What I'm hearing from you is that your fear isn't that you can't pay off your tuition loan debts when you graduate. Deep down, it might be the insecurity of you doing well in your degree which results in you not getting a decent paying job of >$3k. That is where you need to stop. Make an active change in your life and mindset to stop procrastinating, put first things first and go out and get that first class honors. It is definitely possible for you, it just depends on how much effort you put in. Don't compromise on yourself, else you would just crash and burn and wonder why you took the NTU math degree, rake up a load of debt and not have signed on many years ago. 

A last thing you need to know is that coming out from the Army into the workforce is difficult. From my knowledge with hiring managers, they tend to prefer not to hire people from the Army. This is because Army is very bureaucratic (more so than the govt), and the stereotype is that people from the Army cannot ""chiong"". They are perceived as ""nua"" and are, hence, not seemed as the best choice. Esp if you are a Wospec, which is seen as inferior to officers. So take that in mind and choose wisely.

You are the master of your life. Don't make the mistakes that you made before that landed you in this situation, thinking of the What Ifs. Take control and make sure that life from here on has as little mistakes as possible.  ",1,streamofmight,2016-05-16 18:21:05,d35ilud

Anyway, main challenge was finding a job. People from the private unis are the most affected whenever you read a report about youth and fresh grad unemployment. They make up the bulk of the numbers. Think at least 80%-90% of local uni grads find jobs even before graduation and those that don't are usually by their own choice(ie. gap year etc). Private uni grads have a much smaller scope where for example unless you at least have a 2nd upper degree you can almost forget about joining the civil service unless you have some exceptional standout skill else where. Once you take out Sales and events positions you are pretty much left with the admin, ops, customer service positions as the main types of jobs for something generic like a business degree.

School fees for SIM-UOL aren't that much more expensive than local uni, roughly about 28k for a 3 year course. However there are alot more misc fees like the exam fees which have been increasing every year so its almost 2k per year for the exam. And if you wish to have summer school overseas it has to be paid for at your own expense so that ranges from 6k-10k+ depending on which country your summer school is. The summer school btw isn't even a full semester so really few people can afford it.

Finally, unless you are studying something IT related be prepared to have a significantly lower starting pay compared to the local uni grads. The disparity can easily be 1k or even double yours if you compare to the average mgmt trainee or associate in the finance industry. Private uni starting pay is around 2.4k-2.8k whilst local uni is at least 3k.

4jbk44,d3ez767,"Well, firstly, if you're heading on the WOSPEC route, you'll be sent to MP training school in MP Command first. You'll learn things such as military law, firearms training and self defense techniques.There won't be any field camps but you'd still have a few route marches since you're a regular. Training school period lasts for around 2 months and you'd be expected to stay in during the weekdays. 

Once you pass out, you'd either stay within the command to work in one of the units or posted out to work with security troopers. Chances are it will be the former. 

So what are the four units? They are the Military Police Training School, Enforcement Unit, Detention Barracks and Special Investigative Unit. 

There're quite a number if regulars studying part time. If I were you, I'd try my best to get posted to training school as an instructor as their work schedule is much more 'predictible' and thus easier to fit in your studying around.

That being said, studying while working requires alot of discipline. If you are leaving the force after getting your degree, make sure you get the best possible grades you can. It will be hard, but it's definitely doable.

3oqafn,cw07fmg,"Your mother is depressed as heck. Depression is the worst. Part of your mind tells you to just get on with life, find other things worth living for and all that. But a BIG part of your mind and body just doesn't want to cooperate. Imagine being your own dead weight. This is why depressed people often think of death. It is seriously exhausting living like this. (source: am depressed).

Hoarding is a symptom of physiological problems. Depression is a leading cause and based on what you said, I think your father's affair and a bunch of other things have contributed to your mother's hoarding.  Some people over eat, some people drink......some people hoard. I think she might also have some anxiety issues.

However, there must be a willingness to change. Like if you were to tell me, do this and this...you will be able to snap out of this depressive rut and be normal again...I would do it in a heartbeat. I haven't totally given up yet. But not everyone is like this. Some depressed people just don't see the point anymore.

I read that people who hoard are not really aware of their behaviour. They don't really see a problem with it. I used to overeat like crazy. While I knew I was overeating, I was OK with it until I ate the large amount of food and then the regret will kick in. I think this is because there is a physical outcome to overeating aka FAT. Whereas hoarding is just 'stuff' in the house....I don't know if you can attach feelings of regret and inadequacy to hoarding. 

Have you seen the show 'Hoarders'. Look for it online. The hoarders go into a full meltdown when things get removed from their house. But the family members are told not to give in. It is very hard because you love your mother and don't want to see her upset but remember you have to do this for her well being and your brother. 

Your mother needs help. She needs to see a professional but she may not be receptive to this right now. She needs to know how her actions are affecting her children. You need to sit her down and tell her everything, even if she cries or gets defensive. Tell her you are not attacking her or judging her. 

You need to be strong. Perhaps you can begin to de-clutter while she is in the house (after having the talk with her). Start off with the unopened stock of things in the house. Do you really need her to get it for you? If you know where it is (look for it), just put it online and sell it away. And then start selling or giving away books. Start with your books first.

3oqafn,cw089pn,"Hi OP,

There isn't a simple solution to hoarding. It requires the person to be willing to seek help but as with most hoarders, they typically don't and require intervention from others.

You will need to speak to a social worker at the nearest Family Service Centre to see how they can help you in this matter. Let the helping line professionals look into this. The other possibility is for you to see the MP although they may eventually direct you to the FSC as well. 

Don't think too far at this point. Focus on short term constructive steps that you are able to take. When the day comes where there needs to be a massive cleaning up to be done, there are many ways to seek help to get it done, you won't need to worry about cleaning it all up with ur sibling. 

As for the struggle on being filial and respectful, i have always told my own teenage mentees/students that taking a firm stance and speaking up on an impt issue with your parents doesn't mean you are not being filial.

Rudeness is more of how you say something, not so much of what you say.

I've seen mountains of clothes, mattresses crawling with bedbugs, but I've never seen an entire room surrendered to roaches.

What a social help group can do to help you is recognize that your house's case is severe, and gradually make the resources needed to help you change things available to you. Please don't try to shoulder this alone, it's a huge undertaking to turn this around, but it can definitely be done. Volunteers to help you sort out your house, help for your mom, they can make it happen, though it may take some time.

Here's what you can do:  
For your sanity  
* Get the key to your room and keep it locked when you are not around, to prevent more junk from piling up.  
* Start clearing up your room, get rid of things that are not yours either by selling them or stuffing them in the master bedroom. ( If you are not good at clearing stuff, set aside one hour every Saturday where you cannot do anything but clear stuff, you'll break the clutter down eventually)  
* Your mom will probably kick up a fuss about this, you have to stand your ground, and not give in.  
* After you have got yourself a livable room, you can carry on to the living room toilets, any common rooms. Whatever you can't get rid of, keep them in your mother's private rooms, e.g. master bedroom, study, etc.  
* If you can afford it, get some maid cleaning solution to help. e.g.   http://www.income.com.sg/value-added-services/referral-services/domestic-cleaning   
For your Mom's depression  
* Draw whatever blinds that neighbors cannot look in from, sunlight is very important to maintain one's mood.  
* Set up routines, preferably ones that involve social interactions, e.g. a routine part time job, fixed exercise class. You know your mom best, use whatever motivation you can think of to keep her going to these activities.   
For your mom's hoarding:   
* Every once in a while (not every time, this is important) bring up that her hoarding is hurting you or your brother, use extremely specific examples as much as possible, e.g. the insects from the junk piles are leading to rashes, skin issues. Especially when she brings up that they can be useful to you or your brother.    
* Get her items with the money you get from selling the junk, e.g small gold jewelery. Take her out to dinner or show affection occasionally when she helps to clear the junk. The ultimate goal here is for her to associate getting rid of junk with  good feelings or rewards.     
* Do not forcibly remove any junk from her private rooms, you need to leave those areas under her control.

I'm was too young and cowardly to say ""No Dad, even if you gave it away, nobody will want it"". We had old memorabilia such as glass and cracked lanterns that he treasured but we never displayed in our house, old paintings of the initial business he started with my grandfather, old bicycles we never ride anymore.

Eventually when I moved out due to another unrelated argument, I started to stand up for myself more when I moved back in. I think the ""scare"" convinced my father that he could actually lose me.

The real change came when we started to move from a bigger HDB flat to a smaller HDB flat and I took the opportunity to get rid of everything. We had limited space, we bought a new smaller flat and I did not want to pay extra money for the movers to take multiple trips.

We got rid of the mugs save one carton (which we still don't use, he tried to give some cartons to our neighbours and they rejected it. Oh man, you should have seen my Dad's face. He was so sad :*( )

My advice, make 3 goals. Short (within 1 year), middle (3-5 years) and long term (>5years) goals. For example, short term goal can be to clean up the toilet and install a lock. Middle term, to study hard, get into uni and hall. Long term, work hard, earn loads, buy a flat, move your mum out and start from zero to help her with her hoarding. Having clear tangible goals help keep me sane, knowing things will get better. Hope it helps you too.

Also, Char Siew Cockroach made me laugh like siao so later I will share my own funny/sad experiences battling my hoarder parents.

This is how I tackled my mother's problem. It's by no means perfect and also it's still a work in progress, but if you're looking for small solutions that will diminish the big problem then maybe this will help:

**1) Cockroach Infestation Problem**

If you call pest-control and pest bomb the entire cockroach colony in your bathroom & apartment, they will just crawl out and hide elsewhere and that's not what you want. Your neighbors will all complain coz they now have new brown guests. 

The trick is to kill them slowly and gradually. Let me introduce you to a glorious poison called [Roach Chalk](http://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-cockroach-chalk.html)
They affect the roach's brain and causes them to go haywire - something that fills me with glee coz I hate roaches.
Buy these in bulk and put it on all doorways to demarcate rooms where cockroaches aren't supposed to enter/cross. You can get them from those variety household item shops in places like Marine Parade Central. Just show the aunties the picture and ask if they stock.

Word of warning, this is literally poison so wear gloves when u touch them. **NEVER TOUCH THESE & THEN TOUCH FOOD.**

2nd weapon: [Roach Baits](http://www.fairprice.com.sg/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&catalogId=10051&categoryId=13722&productId=25464&errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&langId=-1&top_category=&parent_category_rn=13722&storeId=10001) that slowly kills the roach and then kills other roaches that eat them.

Buy these in bulk also. Throw these inside the bathroom; just randomly scatter them. Because roaches eat anything, eventually one of the roaches will eat this. And they will all start to die slowly.
Also, stick these all over the house. 2 for every doorway. 1 for every corner. Roaches like to crawl close to the floor along the wall, so that is where you should stick these.

I used to live in a roach-infested apartment that had roaches coming up from the drain daily. So you also need to cover the drain. Get a cup or a plate (something that roaches can't chew through) and turn it upside down. I'm sure your mom won't miss the plate.

Hopefully, after some months you will see that the population of roaches is getting smaller.

**2) Your mum's hoarding & the excuses she uses**

Your mum will always say something like, ""This (book, toy, shirt) is still good. Don't throw away. Still can use for your kids."" ""I just want to provide the best for you."" These are all bullshit.

You gotta break down that argument because at the end of the day these are all excuses for hoarding things that she does not really need. You can say things like, ""By the time I have kids, these things would be so old they would fall apart / are moldy / the information in them would be outdated. Let's get rid of them now so OTHER PEOPLE can use them."" (This is my go-to argument) 

Because in the hoarder brain, they excuse themselves from throwing their stuff away by saying that these are all good things and will be usable some day. And at some level that might be true, but the sheer amount they hoard shows that ultimately they don't use that stuff as much as they would like to (or at all). And ultimately, they are just finding excuses for their own uncontrollable behaviour. And love for your children / providing for your children is a very compelling excuse.

Your second argument comes from yourself. Since you are in IP I'm assuming A levels is coming real soon within 1 or 2 years. This is a good way to start a conversation with your mum and get her to start making changes. Explain to her that after A levels comes uni, and when you graduate and eventually get married or whatever, there is no way you or your husband can live in the house, or even bring him back home coz it's so unpresentable. Tell her you won't have time to clean up since you will be busy from now on. If the situation becomes so bad, the neighbors will call police to forcibly remove her from the apartment. This is not something that she wants, nor is it something that you want.

I won't cover the mental health resources to help your mum's hoarding because other people have commented on them.

But as a general rule, it is good if you can slowly introduce habits for your mum. e.g. taiji class at the nearby CC or smth. It gets her out of the house and gives you time to clear out the stuff. Also, most taiji aunties are kaypoh so maybe after a while she will feel pressure to clean up her house.

These changes will help give your mum some sense of accomplishment/like her life is getting better/she is healthier. I understand it's not easy to recover from divorce, esp when one party was cheating. But she has to start somewhere and feel like her life is in control. And how she can do that is to make decisions for her health like exercise, and then gradually clear things out to improve her environment.

**3) Throwing things secretly**

Start with the stuff she can't see. Like items buried under other items or things in your room. Throw 5 items a day. Set a target for your brother too. Get a lock for ur room.

Also, if you throw outside at the garbage area for your building or on your floor (if the rubbish chute is outside), she can see it and then bring it back in (I know this because my parents used to dumpster dive). So leave the stuff on another floor or throw the bulky stuff like the luggage in the next building (troublesome I know).

**3) Selling stuff on Carousell**

This is more time consuming and I honestly think you need a friend to help you. Because you need to sort through your stuff and pick what can be sold or not. Also, you need to constantly update your items so that it comes out on top so people view them and it can be annoying.

But as a general rule, if you can sell the usable items cheap enough, someone else will surely buy them. Use good lighting / edit the picture, take the picture outdoors with a white background.

If you want to bulk sell, you can call [Cash Converters](http://www.cashconvertersasia.com/sg/we-buy/) and ask them to come down to your place and pick up everything. They won't give a good price but at least they can take away some of the bulkiest items like the heaviest books etc.

You can go see your MP if you need some direction as to which agencies to contact. Get her some professional mental help and physical help to clean up the house. You could hire some cleaners and movers, they should not be that expensive with that alimony. Hoarding is a vicious cycle that entrenches her mental instability.

Now is not the time to be embarrassed. What you want is all the help you can get. Face shouldn't even be an issue here. Are there any teachers in school that you can approach for help? 

I think a part of why your mum hoards is because she is allowed to. Cut off her $6000 and she would probably be less able to hoard. Would there be any way to get the $6000 to be controlled by someone else that is more responsible? Or have a big chunk of it go into savings for yours and your brothers future? My fear is that the spending goes out of control and you and your brother are left to fend for yourselves without financial support.

Lastly, don't throw away those books if you can help it. You can have a book sale or as a last resort you can just donate them to salvation army. Or sell them on carousel.",1,Wheat-gen-stein,2015-10-16 19:08:23,3oqafn
3oqafn,cw1ksf3,my SO mum is a hoarder too but she been growing up like this since her dad left very early in her life. The only way to beat this is to burn the house...or move out. You can try to clean up things yourself but it will still come back.,1,myr0n,2015-10-16 21:43:41,3oqafn
3oqafn,cw1nfb4,"HI I am very sorry to hear about your living conditions. I too live with a hoarder until I moved out. My father is one. Then I married one without knowing he is one. The underlying condition of a hoarder is a mental problem. It is typically anxiety, and hoarder gives the hoarder an outlet for expressing the control they don't have over their lives. For my husband, I print out hoarding articles, I print out examples, i don't nag but actively encourage him when he throws things away. Even if it is only a box. You must know it is impossible to declutter secretly. It makes the anxious person feel more anxious and betrayed.

You will also need to accept that your home may be slightly decluttered it will not be your expectation of an empty home. 

There is something that I would suggest that you work on which could bring a sense of control for your mom which is the alimony. Most people who are hoarders may have problems with finances or they could be overally frugal because they fear the day that might come when their world is overturned. I would suggest that you start helping to manage the budget by tracking every household expenditure. If your mom buys something that is not neccessary, question her purchase. She might be upset but explain that you are helping to ensure she saves enough for retirement, rainy day, wasteful etc whatever that appeals to the hoarding side of her. This may an effective way to control her hoarding. This didn't work for my husband and my dad because they are way more frugal than me. :| Hope it helps you.

3oqafn,d1g0as2,"Hi OP, I have a parent who hoards books as well. Dad still has books from when he was in uni and toys for us from 30 years ago. After I moved into hall in uni, I returned home to find that my bedroom has been overtaken by junk and since then (7 years ago) I've been sleeping in the living room sofa. Be prepared that once you're not living at home, you will be surrendering the space to junk and might never dig your room back. 

I was shocked to find out I had no room to stay when I came back. During the 4 years in uni, whenever I return home, I will see more junk piling up in my room. However, I believed my parents when they said that they will clear out the room when I return home. That didn't happen.

**Here is what I wished I did** - during uni, plan your finances carefully and take up part time jobs if possible, so you can save some cash to rent after uni ends. What saved my sanity was renting rooms on weekends to take a breather in. I found a friend with a spare place for about $40-80 a day, and rented saturday nights. Other den that, spend as much time outside as possible - Library and cafes with free wifi are good places, so is SMU because its an open area with power plugs, and a good environment. Get a friend to accompany you because hiding out from your house does get lonely and you feel like a fugitive, and get involved with activities outside. 

**The best solution for books** is to bring them to the library and give them away there - the library has an exchange section where anyone can dump books to be given away free for others to take. 

Whenever I do that, there will be a group of people who crowds around and takes books, and I sometime chat with them and recommend books to their interests. Its more fulfilling then dumping at Salvation army or carouselling them.

I tried Carousell and gumtree for selling books, but realized that maintaining the chats and accounts too tiring and time consuming. Please spend the time more constructively, posting books online and waiting for buyers is not worth the money you earn from it. 

**While throwing away the hoarder's stuff will make the hoarder anxious**, I have since learnt that there is so much junk that the hoarder doesn't even remember or know what they have. 

Sometimes when I throw away things, they will whine and say things like those are still useful and blame you for it even when it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes when I ask them if something is okay to throw, they look at me and say ""I don't remember I still have this"" - but now that they remember you can't throw it. I always kick myself during those situations, because I could have thrown it out without them knowing it. 

**I have approached FSC and various counsellors for help**, but they provided minimal help. In fact, FSC asked me to consider if its my fault for not talking to my parents about it properly, even though I told them I've told my parents about it many times. Each time I go I just break down in tears and they don't help or offer any feasible solutions, and I spend the rest of the day depressed. However, I only approached them when I was 28, so things might be different for you as you're still a minor. 

**The best advice I've gotten from a counsellor** was to move out. I had been reluctant to do so for many reasons - filial piety, taking care of my siblings who are still staying with my parents, etc. However, I moved out last year, and it has been such a great experience. 

I don't have to always be alert and afraid of being yelled at for things, I don't have to protect my things (I stayed in the storeroom for the previous 2 years and had to keep my personal set of utensils in my wardrobe because the kitchen was too dirty, coz parents slept in the 2 living room sofas) or be afraid of my things going missing, and I don't have to be stressed out by the mess at home when I return home everyday. Same situation - lights broken, pipe leaking, but parents too ashamed of hoard to get repairmen in. Siblings showering in the dark now. 

I try my best to fix things for them when I go back, but my help is not always appreciated.  

I sleep so much better. I swear. This is the best thing that will happen to you. Being able to sleep. It took me a year to feel comfortable in a bed - I constantly went outside to sleep in the sofa for the first 6 months after moving out, but now bed is good. 

**If you move out, however, there will be friends who blame you for protecting your sanity.** That happened to me, from friends I've had for 15 years, who say that your mom cares for you, your mom only wants the best for you, how can you do this to your family, etc. You'll feel supremely guilty. However, they don't understand, they aren't there when I had to carry my laundry 10 blocks away every week, so don't blame them and move on with your life. (by the way, please find a laundry service for your clothes. You can get a 1kg bag of clothes washed for $5, don't waste time hand washing them. You can also get the laundry service to collect and deliver to your doorstep, but I've discovered that laundry services are everywhere these days, in shopping malls and under hdb blocks.)

Singapore being what it is, people's view is that it is too expensive for rent and you don't have an adequate reason to rent. People will shame you for spending money needlessly. They will stress you about finances and question you as a person, on top of seeing you as unfilial and ungrateful. Don't tell anyone you're staying away from your family if possible. 

**WRT hyperventilating and panic attacks, it happens to me too.** I've been so stressed about my living situation my whole life that I've hyperventilated with friends who luckily took care of me. If I hyperventilated at home, I will be shouted at too. Once I was choking on something on my knees on the floor gasping for breath and both my siblings continued chilling at the sofa and shouted at me to stop scaring them. When my mom slammed the door onto my thumb because I didn't close the door fast enough and neighbours might look in and see the hoarding, she yelled at me for bursting into tears. So don't expect sympathy for your feelings at home, you're better off with your friends for emotional support. 

One last piece of advice: **DO NOT get attached with a boy just to have a place to stay.** I made that mistake repeatedly, and always end up with either abusive guys or guys with boundary problems who just want to take advantage of you. Don't rush a relationship because someone promises you a place - or because you're subconciously looking for a place to escape to. Don't let any guys know about your hoarding situation unless you're sure of their good character. That is the priority in maintaining good relationships, and you don't want more emotional baggage.

You're strong, you can do it. :)

Hey OP, dont be too hard on yourself as well and certainly don't self-diagnose yourself as bipolar. We all have our ups and downs in life, it doesn't mean we have bipolar disorder. I think it's great that you recognize the problem and are seeking help!

You may have to change the way you interact with your mom and start to put yourself and your brothers well-being in front of her perceived happiness(Though this ""happiness"" is destructive for the whole family, herself included). It seems to me that you put your mothers happiness in front of everything in the family even though her behaviour is extremely selfish and is destroying the family. No need to be mean but you can diffinitively be firm and start to ask for concrete steps and results. **Your and your brothers well being and quality of life has value that she needs to respect too!**

3oqafn,cx8wtv9,"Having once been stuck in a similar situation, although my mom's hoarding never got as bad- but similar dynamics with a distant Father that had an affair / emotionally manipulative and self-destructive mom- I would like to say that you should not be responsible for your mom's resentment towards your father, and should never feel like you have to give one parent up to keep another.

They should both love you, and want what is best for you- regardless of their feelings for each other. The moment one of them uses your affection for them, to hurt the other parent- that is immensely unhealthy behaviour, and it would end up destroying any positive relationship you could have with either of them.

I was fed quite a lot of stories about how evil and terrible my dad was, and as he was away from home most of the time he could not defend himself. But at the same time, my mother's reliance on me was suffocating, although I felt comforted that she trusted me.

It wasn't until my mom passed away, that I was able to regain a sense of balance, to patch things up with my dad, and to see the situation from a more neutral perspective. They both had their faults, but my mom should never have made me feel like being my dad's daughter was an unforgivable betrayal. Her problem with him, should have been settled with him- and not me.

With the distance, I could begin to understand why he stayed away. Not why he strayed, but why he found it so hard to be with her. I didn't fault him for leaving- I used to wish everyday that I could escape from the house, and from the worst parts of my mom. When things were good, it was really good. But more often than not it was bad.

At the end of the day my mom wasn't a healthy person, and she did a lot of things that wasn't right for me or for her. As much as I love her, I felt like I was being sucked into a very dark and narrow world- and that wasn't making me happy or healthy either.

...I'm glad that my dad didn't resent me for taking my mom's side, when I felt that she needed me. But at the same time, I feel sad for leaving him alone, when really it should never have been a him or her scenario.

So OP...what I'm saying is: give your dad a chance to be a dad to you, and learn how to love your mom, but not to allow her to use you as a weapon to hurt your dad. When she does that, it hurts not just him- but you as well. Be there for her, be supportive and loving, but don't sacrifice your relationships just to make her happy- as her happiness/unhappiness is beyond your control.",1,dungalot,2015-11-23 02:42:40,cw1szkh

You will always be able to have life changing experiences at any time in your life. Stuff that you can only do at uni/with uni friends usually comprises drinking, sex, and drugs.

Granted working life ain't a bed of roses but it is precisely the crazy idea that we must all have a terrific social and eventful life in uni will only make us feel lousy about yourself. If you ask me, I would say the jc/poly to uni period is potentially the most pretentious time of our lives, where most people may or may not be having fun but very few are true to themselves. Some people call it growing up pains, I call it a massive disconnect from being congruent.

Depression can be a hallowing experience and even after you recovered, you wonder whether you could ever be the same again, whether you can be back to being the person you used to be and whether the depression journey has taken away so much from you that you are basically handicapped or crippled for the rest of your life. 

You mentioned you feel like crying when you see the freshies. I think you might be grieving.  That said,  don't compare yourself to anyone else. Many of them may be facing inner struggles, trying so hard to fit.

Regarding loneliness: have you considered joining a club or interest group? It's the start of a new academic year - it's a good chance to make friends! If you're in NUS, I think NUS is currently having some sort of fair on today in the sports hall. Or just go for their welcome teas - there should be a few, since it's the beginning of the academic year. 

Talk to someone you sit next to in lecture/class. This doesn't always work - you may not click, but talking to people is a lot like that. It's a hit-and-miss thing - you won't click with everyone, but the point is to keep trying until you do. Don't be put off by big groups.

Depending on your course/major/school culture, speaking up in class sometimes works - partly because people think you're smart/interesting, and approach you for notes/more in-depth class discussion.

Something else about being self-conscious that has helped me: fake it until you make it. It doesn't matter what you're thinking inside: people are only going to be seeing the outside (for first impressions anyway). And besides: if you do anything embarrassing, you're only going to be in NUS for one more year. They aren't going to remember it/be around to judge you.

It's good that you recognise your depression and you try to seek help but it would be better to actively seek help from actual counsellors rather than redditors on the net. ",1,dadablacksheep,2014-08-15 20:46:46,2dlmuu
2dlmuu,cjqto96,"While uni may be a good time to make friends, it's also not the only opportunity you have.

Anyway, your social issues and poor grades seem to stem from your anxiety (social anxiety disorder, perhaps?) and depression. These two things have exceeding high co-morbidity, and I speak from experience that you're not going to be able to overcome these things alone.

This is why I'm honestly recommending that you seek counsel from a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Medications can help with your anxiety and depression, and psychotherapy is particularly helpful (if nothing else, it's very cathartic to speak to someone who gets what you're going through). IMH provides excellent treatment, but if you would like more discretion, you can always consider the private route if you can afford it.

Anyway, the bottom line is that you should really seek some form of counseling. Don't get stuck in your current status quo. With proper help, your social life and grades can rebuilt, so there's always hope!

I was actually rather depressed as well in the 2 years leading up to university (i notice it now). Life just generally felt so boring and pointless; my daily routine was just go school, back home, procrastinate and barely study.

Life is better now since I've gotten into uni but you should know that now you're healthier/in better shape, you need to put the effort in to getting yourself out there. 

Join some clubs that interest you, do volunteer work, join a sport club (with like weekly games) or just go run/gym. You need to give your mind some times to just focus on one thing and forget about your 'problems'. 

I felt like being a 'yes' man for awhile really helped me; this meaning that whenever an opportunity for me to participate in something arose, I would grab it - even if i didn't feel like it or i was a bit busy.

I just hope that I will get more confident again. I lost almost all my confidence in uni. Funny thing is the uni I go to is supposed to make me more outspoken and confident.

Trust me, it's just a feeling. It's a *lie*. Your brain has a habit of lying to you when you're depressed.

What you have to do now is to fight the negative thoughts. The most practical ways that I have personally used (in no particular order) are:

* 1) *Exercise regularly*

Like, every day. Even when you don't feel like it. Even when you feel like shit. Just go out there and run, do a gym workout, or whatever makes you sweat (although personally I find aerobic exercise more efficacious than anaerobic exercise). The endorphin boost will help you tremendously. You'll notice that you'll start feeling a little more positive, and maybe that life just isn't so shitty as you thought it was an hour ago.

* 2)* Seek counseling* 

Your uni mental health center is a good place to start. For one, it's free. Secondly, staff working there are specially trained to deal with mental health problems specific to the college student/young adult population. So you'll get counselors more sympathetic *and* more knowledgeable about your plight than some random GP/psychiatrist. Of course, if you have a doctor you can trust (e.g. the one you saw for your sickness) by all means open up to them, they'll be more than willing to help you.

* 3) *Get a pet*

I know, right? Get a pet, he says. Trust me, it does help with your depression. Looking after an animal that is more helpless than yourself will help relieve the cycle of negative thoughts in your mind by providing a cute and furry (I'm thinking hamster here haha) distraction. Obviously if you live in the dorms then no point in smuggling one on campus, but do try to get access to other people's pets if possible. Even if you're not an animal person, the principle works.


Try it out. Hope the above advice helps you as much as it has helped me.


> I guess the uni I chose really believes in trial by fire...

BTW, Could you elaborate on that? The ""trial by fire"" sounds like an artifact of your course rather than the uni, IMHO.

Depending on the size of the club and the people turning up and the varing friendliness of the people, the club members may initiate conversation with you. Making friends might work, it might not, it might need more time to do so - but life is partly about taking these kinds of risks. Anyway, if it goes wrong (you don't get to talk to anyone, you aren't interested in the clubs), you don't know anyone there, so you can just walk out (politely) and try again at the next club.

I think I get what you're saying. I let myself do that because it feels like de-stressing. But I've also tried to recognise that this isn't productive, so after some time of doing this (which I monitor strictly - e.g., I'll give myself the whole bus ride to indulge in these thoughts), I force myself to do other things, like messing around on the internet (e.g. on reddit).

2br62k,cj89kk4,"Hi

I've been battling depression on/off for the past 6 years. Anyway, you have two options - you can see a psychiatrist at one of the private hospitals (or those with their own independent clinics), but those will set you back at least $180 per session. They'll help formulate a diagnosis and prescribe anti-depressants.

Additionally, I've found that seeing a psychologist for CBT or EFT is a really good complement to the meds since they help you learn coping techniques. If you see one privately, expect to pay roughly the same amount of at least $150 per hour.

However, if you find these charges too expensive like I did, you may wish to consider IMH. In particular, the Sayang Wellness Clinic is kind of the 'privatized' wing of IMH. Charges are much lower, and as a current patient, I can attest to the fact the care provided there is excellent (especially the nurses, they are extremely friendly). I found it to be the best balance between being affordable while still allowing me a higher degree of privacy.

So say your bill is $100, you will have to pay the first $30 or so, and 10% of the balance. Which means you got to pay $37. The balance may be deducted by your cpf. There is a cap on how much you can use and iirc, it's $400 per year. 

EDIT: to use your cpf, you've to fill in a form and also your psychiatrist got to sign, saying that you have depression. And each visit, you got to let the person at the counter know you will be using cpf to pay during registration and not wait till payment. ",3,teamaniac,2014-07-26 23:43:39,2br62k

* There can/will be side effects, both to getting on the medication and getting off the medication. Nausea, appetite changes - the side effects vary depending on the medication. 
* There is no one type of anti-depressant, and not all of them will work for you. So you can spend two months trying one, determining that it doesn't work, then a month getting off the anti-depressant, trying a new one, etc. Time frames vary, but if you are unlucky, a counsellor will be much faster.
* Cost. 
* Being on anti-depressants also have side effects. 

I recommend going to a counsellor first and then asking them if they have a referral to a psychiatrist. I've heard good things about the [Counselling and Care Centre](http://www.counsel.org.sg/) for starters. Counselling/talk therapy could potentially take less time than medication.

Rental usually is around 500 to 700 for a room. That may or may not include utility bills. Also there is a security deposit and a minimum occupancy of 6 months usually. 

Buying say a private studio apartment  in 2018, if you want it cheaper would be around the  500k range if you don't mind living somewhere further. That would mean forking out at least 1.5k monthly . Also don't forget you can't loan this at 100% of the cost. On top of that if you have agent that will be cost, other fees and duty to pay too. 

So you need a big chunk of change first, then if you can afford the mortgage, then it might be feasible. Don't forget the loan on top will always change their variable unless it is hdb loan which is fixed at 2.5%. Also I haven't include renovation too. That's another bomb.

1. Obvious one here is rent somewhere, though this will eat into your potential savings for a house in anything you want to put away on top of your CPF. I know its nice to have cast especially at your age and wages are low, but i wish i saved more when I was younger.  

2. Spend less time at home, you said you have an outdoor hobby which requires space, great, do more of it, spend more time with friends, any study you want to do, do it outside where you can, with less distractions at home you'll get more done.  

3. Suck it up for a couple of years and put every cent you can into savings, get yourself a house deposit together with the goal of buying something. This will mean sacrifice and tolerance but it will give you the most freedom in the long run.  


I feel that Asian family culture with many living under 1 roof greatly increases your ability to save, for me I turned 18 and I was paying rent at home, as well as bills and food. If you can tolerate it a little longer I recommend option 3. If you move to renting you are literally throwing your money away, if you are able to buy a house, even a 2 bdrm, you can rent one out and thats money back into your pocket, reducing the repayment and essentially forcing you to save in the way of maintaining an asset.

Without a hospital admission, it may take a while to get an outpatient appointment through a polyclinic referral. Private clinics are really, really expensive.

If it's the latter that's been causing you distress, then you shouldn't beat yourself up over it but try to take small steps to improve yourself as a person.

I highly recommend checking out what Dr Jordan Peterson has to say about dealing with mental health - and life - issues [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5QRiJZ0Go) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7E_4c_s9y8) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuQgJxYriYI) [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GSf5cYCvE&list=PL_K7XH1AIG8z6Vh8DjwUHCDoXHMf9bMLZ&index=4) [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSV5KJqSlFY) [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFeIRVueNRM) [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJxcLyg3-Q) [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU) [9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0) [10](https://youtu.be/v0Qm8I2cCAE) [11](https://youtu.be/XbOeO_frzvg)]. He's helped me change my perspective on mental health and some others quite a lot. His advice has been indispensable to me and has been largely responsible for getting me to try to put my life back on track. ",20,doctorwhybother98,2017-10-10 23:02:59,do5qauv
75eq2i,do5qn2x,"Is it affecting your daily routines? basically seek help if you think you can't recover on your own. in your example, a question to ask yourself would be 'can I get out of this guilty loop that only worsens?'. if you don't think you can, then seek help. And yes, it is as simple as that. Because of the stigma of seeking mental professional help, things that can be nipped in the bud quickly usually end up snowballing into something serious (which is the bulk of what is portrayed in the media sadly). so if you think nothing is working, seek help ! early intervention like counselling/therapy can save you alot of cost.",3,swimNotsink,2017-10-10 22:12:46,do5qauv

75eq2i,do5vzk1,"IMH can be a very horrid place, it's seen as a last resort type of institution from what I've gathered from other patients. Mental healthcare in general can be very frustrating anywhere. You will meet psychiatrists who will, it seems, just throw pills at the wall until one sticks. In the process, you may be on a cocktail of drugs some with side effects you will need additional medication to counteract. Therapists, I've found, are not the most trained either. Certain therapies that are being utilised in other developed nations have not made their way here and you really have to demand to see specific doctors/professionals to get the right treatment. And if you have a cluster B disorder, it's even worse because you are seen as having something ""incurable"" and are therefore hopeless. But this is also a problem with mental healthcare in general, the field is constantly changing and certain disorders have a lot of stigmas which the experts themselves exhibit.

The nurses came across as prison wardens and were extremely rude to the patients, and the entire place came across as a prison or an asylum to keep 'the crazies' locked in for the benefit of society rather than for their recovery and rehabilitation. The sad part is that quite a few of the patients are so far gone that they don't even realise they are being mistreated. The moment I walked into the ward and saw how things were like I made a hell lot of noise and got myself discharged in 5 hours. The funny part is, the day right after I got admitted and discharged I was out in town running some errands and I bumped into one of the nurses who was rude to me, we made eye contact and she looked like she had seen a ghost.",2,y08hci0299,2017-10-11 12:06:00,do5tess

The down vote say otherwise... frankly and I'm not joking... It's part of the bullying in this society that drives people to this thoughts. To admit, about 1-2 years ago, I had the same thought too while being inside a deep collective corporate bullying.

But surviving it makes me stronger, even if learning this after almost 3 decades of my life. 

Things that doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Things that do kill you, and it's all over.

Lastly, rather than coming up with ""we'll talk to you everything, we'll help you"", I rather highlight those with genuine intentions and skills to handle those with depression.

9emz81,e5q1gum,"Here's a few suggestions I would give ...

1) If you intend on going into some specific career path/job, you can start acquiring most of those skills even on your own, even at home - don't be one of those people that shows up on the first day of work and barely even understands what the company does or anything about the industry - do your research.  These days you're seconds away from having access to anything and everything you can think of.

2) Don't overthink it and find yourself paralysed from the panic of feeling unprepared. Go in, and ask questions, ask questions, ask questions, then ask some more questions.  More often than not it's not about what you know, it's about how quickly you can learn on the job. Don't just do the minimum required for your job - go out of your way to understand how the work that you're doing fits into the bigger picture, how it relates to all other processes in the company.

3) As someone who has hired, fired and managed plenty of plenty over the years - believe me when I say that almost everything you learn in uni is going to be useless - don't care if you were homeschooled or went to Harvard.  Most people for whom it's their first job, have no idea what they're doing. The ones that think they know what they're doing are often the biggest headaches to deal with.  The people who do the best and get promoted the fastest are the ones who are constantly asking questions and trying to understand things outside of their immediate responsibilities.

4) Spend 10x more time listening than talking.",5,michaelflux,2018-09-11 06:00:21,9emz81

Adding onto that, are your parents aware and supporting your decision? If yes, then just see a psychiatrist, tell him everything including the fact that you want a gap year. He needs to know everything and what you want before he can officiate a letter addressed to your school. Talking to your school counsellor would only end up involving a lot of people trying to convince you to stay, and possible alienation if they treat you abnormally(speaking from my personal experience so it may differ)

Speaking of personal experience, I too had a gap year when I was young after O levels, due to my MDD getting more severe. Gap year doesn't mean being at home alone everyday, wanking off to games or sleeping 16 hrs a day. It will just become more severe. You need to have a hobby, and people around you supporting you to have a breather and actually improve.

I don't know if someone as young as I am is qualified to give advice, but take what you will...

You've basically made a post on reddit asking for help, then dismissed all the advice people give you. Cmon...

The easiest way to live life is to not care too much. Now I'm not saying you should go to school dressed in a singlet and sweatpants, and sleep in lectures. Just do what you have to do, and don't sweat the small stuff.

So what if a few people leave your life? They wouldn't have been good friends anyway. So what if someone hates your guts? Who're they in the long run? Who is anyone in the long run? 

Think of one popular person in your workplace/school. Don't you hate his guts? Does he care? Think of it this way: for every one person who hates you, there are several others who think you're the bees knees.

I'm not going to say that our lives are completely alike. But I can see some similarities between us. Granted, I had social anxiety for very different reasons. But I, and everyone I know who's had social anxiety got over it by simply not caring as much. It won't go away overnight, but over time you'll realise ""I wouldn't have done this 3 months ago"". It's a long process. But it's one you have to undergo if you want to be a productive adult in modern society.

I find it easier to talk to people after a while when I start to ask them a few questions everyday, whether the questions are relevant to each other is another story.

382as8,crruq3b,"Hm. 

About making friends:

Common interests and habits usually help people to make friends with each other, because at the very least you guys can become acquaintances haha. After that it's more reliant on chemistry between the two of you, whether you can get along, whether you think like each other, etc. Join a CCA in school, go to events and stuff and put yourself out of your comfort zone. 

If you don't dare to move out of your comfort zone, that's the problem - you're too afraid to chase after anything, and too lazy to expend the effort required to do so. Nothing's really going to come easy.

Anxieties in general - it's okay to worry. I worry a lot too. I kind of realized that the things I worry about never seem to happen, and that it's always the unexpected things (things that will not occur to you, even in your worrying) that really gets me, so.. I guess it's all down to attitude? 

Just tell yourself that for whatever you do, everything can be reduced to a series of steps - 小事大事都一步一步做就是了. After all, 船到桥头自然直. Haha. So even though you're worrying a lot, try to be able to put those thoughts aside and move, step by step, to achieve what you want.

72qtnx,dnkmcdg,"So from someone who was you, 8 years ago. 

Bad relationship blah blah, so I didn't want to go to class at all, and well my gpa died. This led to me fighting with my parents as they believed my grades were because of computer games (i switch skirt-chasing hours into LoL hours). I didn't think they believed that my gpa is because of a relationship, and didn't feel like telling them (they never wanted me to have one). 

I had a few suicidal attempts, to the point I would write a contract with my parents on how to parent me. They sign or I go. It got so bad that I ran away from home, 8 days before my internship to graduate at all.

I talked to people. Not parents or counselors or psychologists (seen them all tho). I talked to people, friends. Their friends friends. The one thing friends can give you what professionals cannot, is that some friends are in worst states than you. You literally talk to them and feel how pointless my problem was.

I told myself. Ok look this suicide thing won't fix shit. I think on like the 8th day, if I did not report to school, that's my graduation. I went up to the highest floor, completely sober. Had to do it sober. I told myself, ok if you think your problems are unsolvable. Jump. Do it. 

I stared blank at the sky for a good minute, then I went back to my friend's house. Tomorrow still going to happen, tomorrow you drag yourself to internship. What's the point? You can't be lucky or see the change in winds by being dead. Stick it out another 6 months. I mean, live out the hell a little longer. Does it matter if you die today or tomorrow?

And I told myself. Ok I'll kill myself next week. Next week man, next week. At least go and spend finish your money on steak. Get wasted on drugs or something. Die with a big bang. That made me happy to continue. Big bang death. 

The more I thought about it, the more I needed this big bang. I couldn't just die now, 2 weeks into internship. Kinda lame no?

It kept me ""safe"" for six months until I graduated. And halfway, my director sat me down and explained to me my options. There was but 1 option I had. So perhaps I was lucky, perhaps you may not have the same fortune.

But it took me 4 months living through hell to find the golden ticket. 4 months thinking, planning, deciding, my death. And suddenly, things were a TINY bit better.

I'm not going to say life turned out better for me. Army was bliss. But after army.... In university, I formed a suicide pact with an online stranger. I couldn't finish school, finished the rest of it at home, doing online classes.

I wouldn't say still that life became better.

After graduating half a year late, I worked in FnB for 2 years, unable to find a job. Unfortunately, I somehow convinced the stranger that life was pretty fun. She cancelled the pact. So damn, there goes my not-dying-alone plan.

I finally am working, but again, I still wouldn't say I'm okay. I was an alcoholic smoker. I burnt my health freely on purpose.

right now? I can't say life is good. but hey, I got a girlfriend smarter than me, im either an alcoholic or smoker now (so i either drink today or have a cigarette, but some days i can drink for a week and be clean on cigarettes. actually managed to quit smoking for a bit, first time in 8 years). surviving all those years? 8 years of hell, but hey i also now have 8 years of fantastic awesome memories. i hate life still, but i also love life too.

But you know, as much as im struggling now, right now, if you ask me, was it worth keeping myself alive? putting myself through all the mental breakdowns that i saw coming a mile away? the tearing apart of my family, the isolation of my friends. 

Yes. Yes it was worth it. Because if I ever could have a chat with you over some coffee, you wouldn't be hearing the pain I went through for 8 years making the decision to live. You'll hear of all my marvelous tales while we laugh about the events I've been through. At the end of the day you'll be like ""wow he's pretty awesome.""

Did you know I broke down laughing when I went to get a tattoo? So hard the artist scolded me cuz he kept laughing. So hard the manager came out to see what was happening and broke out laughing. 

And so many more of these stories. But hey, at 18, standing there at the ledge. My god. Ask me back then if I wanted to kill myself? Yes the intent is fully there. I did not forsee how I could have ended up where I am now. 

So my advice to you? Life can't get better if you're dead. Life may not get better while you're still alive, but hey, it can. not all the time. but it can. and sometimes, the little times that it can, makes you feel happy for living that long to experience it. 

Edit: Lemme write some happier stories and have a virtual coffee with you all in stuck mrts.

#1 The Singaporeanism is real.

I was overseas and found two NUS people, who somehow decided to invite me on their ocean road trip. I, was the specific reason why while hiking, I misled 80% of the people going downhill. Im the reason we got lost basically, all because of square rocks (i said, hey that's a square rock. singapore don't have square rocks. wow. so i mean if this is the first time im seeing it, then obviously this wasn't the way we went up, since then I would have noticed it. so it must be this other way. fuck. my. logic. LOL). so ok halfway we realize we are lost and have no idea where we are. 

this german girl has a gopro cam, and she starts doing the whole ""last moments caught on tape before death"" with the i love you mummy daddy stuff. camera got passed around. The dutch, british, american, two australians, all did that i love you thing. the camera was passed to us. all three of us did not start with i love you. we all started with ""ok remember to fill out the insurance form to take the money for our deaths. i've transferred mine to ntuc so you can just call them up, the number on their website etc... oh and i love you mummy daddy"" 

One of the dutch people was like ""oh damn singaporean students are so... amazing even in the face of death. your *parents must have been so glad* to have you guys as their children""

uhhh... HAHAHA. thanks singapore. <3


#2 Ultimate Lazy Technique for army (im office boy)

I used to be late to work for army. Everytime I'm late, I sign one guard duty. in office, guard duty refers to coming in at 7am and book out 6.30pm (normal time is 8am or something, im always late, i don't remember what the exact time is. that's how often i am and 5.30pm is the normal time everyone books out). How bad was it? Guard duty by
right is rotated among everyone assuming nobody kena guard duty (and normally nobody kena. at most 1 month the Mdm give out 2-3 guard duties as punishment).

I remember that month had 31 days. I did 31 days of guard duty. 

The day after I finally finished my 31-day course, im just milling about the office (im admin) so then the dental Mdm comes up and starts yelling where the newspaper was. Im like oh fuck that is my job (admin job is pick up newspaper everymorning from downstairs). She sees me. FUCK GG. She turns to the guy doing guard duty and scolds him. HE GETS UP TO TAKE NEWSPAPER. wait what?? HE APOLOGIZES. ???

Next day I observe. The person assigned to guard duty picks up the newspaper as well. I've been doing guard duty so long that everybody, including the ranking staff, assumed it was the guard to pick up newspaper. I've never picked it up since for the next 19 months.

Holyshit talk about lazy. I always laugh whenever the guard picks up the newspaper thereon. It took 21 months for my best friend (ah, i never had one before. 21 year old then get best friend. if i died at 18... haha die without having known a best friend. really sia. best friends are fun to have) to figure out it was MY job. he also uhm... found out that about the 25 extra things he does is also my job. to the point he did his own investigation and realize uhm....

i give him do everything that is my job that i lazy to do. which is. everything.

later on, about 5-6 years, in a way, i saved his life too. apparently the longer you live, the more lives you save or something. i've saved about 4 lives since from suicide. and all not on purpose one. they just... decide to keep living. don't even know why. i specifically rejected the counselling course in psychology when i was studying for my diploma/degree so im definitely 100% uncertified to counsel. it's there on my resume. failed counselling module.

HAHAHA. i know. it's just funny to me. well. today i put on my nice looking shirt that i took from my brother cuz i have no taste in clothes, and im off to a business meeting (lolol look at mr lazy going for meeting), and i have a shitton of work to do until monday. im reluctantly a relatively functioning working adult now. or something. 

time to drag myself out of the house, just like i did, 8 years ago. :D

That being said, if they're still really stubborn, then try to make the best out of your situation. Ik it's easier said than done, but in cases like this where you can't change the situation, you've got a choice whether you want to go through it happily or suicidal-y (?).

It seems like perhaps you have shut yourself emotionally from them, due to fear of disappointment, scolding, depression. Please when you are feeling down and suicidal, always remember that a parent's love is unconditional, and not contingent on you doing well in school, holding a great job etc. Do try to communicate with your parents, connect on an emotional level, don't be afraid to show your insecurities and fears. Also, having come through the system and pretty much aced everything through uni and post-grad, you will find that success and especially wealth has very little to do with results or your education cert, but more to do with how rugged and how mch you are willing to work for your success.
Again, please don't commit suicide. I would die if I knew my daughter was considering something like that. Please try to talk to your parents, and if you need more help feel free to PM me.",40,requiem2104,2017-09-28 00:48:06,72qtnx

I always tell people this: ""If you can do something about it, just do your best. If you can't, don't worry yourself sick over something you can't possibly change"".  

It may seem naive to not think about the future in our competitive country. But learn to start investing in yourself, do what you can to improve yourself. You have to start loving and respecting yourself, then can we expect others to do the same. Everyone has their own pace in life, don't bother chasing. People with ADHD take even 8 years to finish college with people labelling us as lazy and ourselves thinking we are just incompetent.  

Small victories, they should always be celebrated. That way you don't lose sight of your progress as a person. That way you know how far you've come, how much you've had to go through to get here.  


By the way if you have issues focusing, can't see your next step or just feel like you can't do well, visit /r/ADHD and find out how much they struggle with everyday life and how they celebrate simple things like being able to go through a simple day being able to follow through with their schedule or even the big ones like completing a degree in 8 years where normally it would take 4.

Do what you have to, until you can do what you want to.

Talk to someone about it - a trusted friend, a school counselor, a family member. Talk to them not about the low GPA but about you wanting to commit suicide over it. The reason for being alive is not about obtaining a perfect GPA (7 billion people on earth and how many do you think have that?). Neither is it about failing.

Your passion is history, mine is too. Pick up books and keep reading them in your spare time (or watch countless history documentaries online!). You don't have to study your passion nor even make it your career. Passion gives us a reason to live and it may be useful for you to keep yourself filled with it now.

Getting into the banking industry with those grades would be difficult at best; but is that really what you want?

I want to share it is not all doom and gloom. I was in a normal course for one year. I did move to express but I was always close to the bottom. My classmates were really good at studying. I manage to get into polytechnic even though my grades could get me to jc. It was not a high ranking jc. I went to polytechnic and was a consistent c performer. My parents could afford for me to attend university in Australia. At that time it was considered buying a degree. At university I was mainly a strong c performer. I did well only in research or assignments. I don't perform well in exams at all. I did a few years of work and decided why not do a masters degree. I did one part time. Again I was a strong c performer. My highlight was my thesis. I was told I got the best marks of my whole class. At work doing a masters is a handicap. Bosses don't like someone who has better educational qualifications than them. 

 Every part of my studying life I thought of suicide. I had strong suicide ideation at university. I didn't tell anyone because if I did it I didn't want to be stopped. But I didn't. Don't know why. Perhaps because I was finally in the final year and I was doing assignments and research. 

I work in a bank. I started as a call center agent. My pay is just like everyone else - disappointingly low. Still that way now. But of course other people will think it is high. It's about perspective because all the people I work with have pay way higher than me. It has not changed for ten years. About half of my work life I lead a team. I still do but the pay and the grade? Seriously the co could do better. 

What I want to tell you is how well you do at school has no bearing on your work life. All you need to do is to just finish it. You will be good at some things. Perhaps not studying but at least you finished it.

72qtnx,dnksu48,"Grades and studies are not the end points in life. While it may seem very important to you currently, on hindsight it will not break you as a person. 

I'd recommend a good communication session with your educated parents if you deem the pressure from them is too much. You'll have to find a way to initiate it and make it fruitful. If intending to communicate, first come up with your intentions. Don't start one without firm outcomes as it will get no where. 

Considering the JC route if you are one who can study sounds really good to me too, if you wish to and think you are able to enter university especially local U. Doesn't matter you are a little later than peers, don't have to mind opinions or judgements from others.

One thing I'd like to share with you, not sure how insightful will it be. To me, there are a few ways I view tertiary education.

1) gain necessary knowledge and skills to specific fields and open up career paths - scientists, engineers, medical, etc.
2) gain necessary non-textbook skills and mature yourself, such as life skills, project skills etc. Think of science degree holders being recruited by local banks. They hire you for their analytical brains and people skills, not what they memorized for exams.

Like you, I really like history and wars/conflicts and religion. My grades were ok (mainly because I liked what I was studying) and that allowed me to find a well-paying job. 

Now I help out with recruitment for my company and many students ask how they can prepare for our interviews, or whether their degree is relevant for us. My answer is that the subject doesn't matter, it's more whether you have an interest in the work (current affairs) and whether you have a brain. 

So there ARE options if you decide to try the JC/Uni route and study something you like!

72qtnx,dnm4obv,"**Some background**

I did poly doing a course I never liked because it was something foisted on me by my parents. That being said I got a pretty shitty GPA as well and couldn't get into local Uni (Par UniSim) and I ended up going overseas to study.

Ended up studying something I wanted, but then slowly discovered it wasn't something I was still extremely passionate about. Finished uni, came back to Singapore to a pretty dismal economy, ended up working for an MNC in a totally unrelated field (to both poly and uni studies).

**Couple of things you need to know**

I've learnt over the years that the secret to people who ""do well"" in life don't particularly do well because they were extremely passionate about something but because they made it a point to excel whatever task is infront of them. This is whether or not that task is of their own choosing.

Yes you're in a course that bores you, something you're probably disinterested in etc. But to be honest and giving you the hard truth that you need to hear; Getting 2 GPA in poly isn't about passion or competency or even ability. I've seen people who can't rub two brain cells together manage a 3.2 GPA by sheer effort alone, and this is in something like Chemical Engineering. You have to take a good hard look at yourself and determine if you want to continue on this path of doing badly and feeling sorry about it and yourself or finally take the step to owning your problems and rising above it. 

If for example you do not, take comfort that (if you're male) that national service will force you to do so inevitably. 

Also the secret to success isn't grades, despite what you've been taught your entire life about success (in this rather outmoded education system) The secret to success in life is personal excellence. Doing whatever you choose to do with incredible self drive. 

**And what I challenge you to do is:**

1. Make the best of your circumstances. Find a way to score well for the next 1 year of your poly. Talk to lecturers, tell them you're willing to make the best of what you have and ask them to set aside time to help you, go for every consultation and sit through every lecture multiple times.

2. If you're passionate about something in life, excel in it, keep moving forward and don't give yourself excuses. Push yourself to be better at it. For me it was video games and video game economies. I started writing guides, had my own youtube channel at one point and did general numbercrunching/theorycrafting. Prior to finding work I made about 10k USD total from games. It was why I got hired into the job I'm currently at and why I could turn down an opportunity to work at Amazon, it wasn't my grades, its just that I excelled at something.

3. Learn how to think positively, it is the most essential skill in life. You mentioned it already, your parents are well educated and you're probably in the upper to middle crust of Singaporean society. Count your blessings, take a full stock of the opportunities still afforded to you and don't throw them away. Life isn't just about the now but the potential opportunities that it has to offer. I went through my own bout of depression and being suicidal but here I am today working in decent job, making a decent living and engaged to someone I love and cherish. Also from my experience many decent companies will, despite your grades, hire you for your positive mental can-do attitude.

4. Also last but not the least. As I'm about to get married next year and possibly have kids sometime in the distant future it is slowly dawning on me that anyone who's a new parent is just about as lost as a cave man in a physics symposium as to how to raise a child. It's a huge responsibility that most of us aren't ready to take on, and to be honest I don't think anyone is or will be. Your parents did what they thought was right for you given their circumstances and their experiences in life. If they are well meaning and I assume they are, do try to cut them some slack. We all spent the early parts of our lives learning to be workers in this economy, how to survive and put food on the table. Parenthood is something almost all of us weren't trained to do. TL:DR your parents muddled through trying to raise a child the best they could, you will possibly do it to. Love them as much as you can, forgive them of their mistakes and put the past behind. Keep moving forward. 

Wishing you all the best.",2,FluffyPortalWanker,2017-09-28 20:59:17,72qtnx

Having worked in a bank for many years, I have seen so many kinds of people with various qualifications, ESPECIALLY in back office. Back office is nothing math of finance related, you just have to be hardworking and put in the hours - it's a lot of paperwork, really. Please don’t be too clever and apply for a BO job through the banks’ career portal, you’ll be fighting with local uni grads. Instead, go through a recruiter, ie. Recruit Express, etc etc (you know what I mean). They’ll start with putting you in a temp 6-month BO contract. Once you have that on your resume, it’s easier for your to get another contract job or hopefully a permanent job.

Now, let me address your attitude. I can sense a big “woe is me” tone from you. A lot of people in the world have to do things they don’t want to do. Your parents expect this out of you, deal with it. Please put in the effort and try to at least bump up your GPA in Year 3. You think school is hard? Try working.

There is always shortage of analytical people in these areas field. Having a knowledge of the banking skills could help you gain employment in the banking industry on another discipline. Things like data visualisation, AR, and predicative analytics are areas that mathematical. Some Australia university's are also in Singapore with a good reputation and and have lower entry requirements and are well connected to banking industry.

72qtnx,dnkqjqb,"Please don't take your own life just because of your poor grades. You are only 18, you still have your whole life ahead of you. You think it might end your suffering and despair, but in reality you're only transferring them to your parents and friends. 

Spend some time sitting down and thinking about what you REALLY want out of life. A degree? Happiness? A well-paying job? You said you liked humanities, but there wasn't any humanities-related course in poly, so you're in banking diploma now. It's okay. Explore your education options after your banking diploma, and come up with a plan. Don't listen to your parents advice, or whatever you hear from them and your friends. It's your life, why should they determine it?

From what I can infer, you're most probably afraid of being judged and looked down upon by other people. In life, you have to learn not to give a shit. Don't think too much of what people might or might not think about you, as you could use the time to further improve and better yourself.

Try to appreciate the small things in life. You are already quite lucky to be born in Singapore, to be in Poly studying, have ample food, water and a warm shelter. I am not trying to put you down or criticise you, but many more other people are experiencing worse in this world. What about those elderly who are still working odd jobs to support themselves, day-in and day-out? 

My current advice to you is, finish Poly. After poly, take a gap year or 2, and meanwhile search for new options to pursue your passion/goals, either overseas or locally. Craft a good plan, and swear by it. 

If you need anyone to talk to, you can call the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), or message me over Reddit. I am always willing to lend you an ear.",1,lockheed_2000,2017-09-28 04:26:18,72qtnx
72qtnx,dnkr4m9,"There's also the option of just finishing your diploma and switching industries ( be it humanities or sales or whatever you want ). 

At the end of the day, EXPERIENCE is worth three times more than some official piece of paper. For example, my parents - my dad has a diploma in electric eng. and my mom has an 'O' level cert. But through hardwork and determination they gave me a very comfy life - the diploma holder ironically never even worked in anything related to electric engineering!! He worked in sales for over 10 years now then switched to become a field application engineer ( for touchscreen company ) and is now earning maybe 7k+ per month minimum. He says it's mostly on the job training. 

Besides, if you do well in the work industry you will definitely shine and progress. 
For example if you worked this job for 5+ years maybe your employer may give you the opportunity to take up a degree and may even pay fully for your course. Of course, maybe you will lose out to your friends in terms or income but if you shine the peanut enough it will glitter.

I thought being in NTU was at least a secure platform for my future, but guess not. The one thing you should keep in mind is be adaptable, if you're adaptable you can achieve anything, that's something we are not familiar with because we all crave for stability.

You are still young less than 25. You never know how life will turn out or throw you sweet surprises. 

You might be disappointed with yourself but don't worry too much, maybe go for a jog, exercise and clear your mind, then think about what's the next step, where do you want your life to go, then take a tiny step towards that.. 

There are jobs related to history. Some government related jobs like Home Affairs, state courts, mica, museums, schools, they hire arts, history, social science graduates, to work for them. Writing policies or other diverse work. It's not a dead end. Being good at history means you're able to read/decipher/analyse textually, understand social contexts, and form cohesive arguments.

Always remember that you are not limited by what you graduate by. I studied business tourism and now I'm in a job of a very different nature that I love, and it took me 2-3 jobs before I got to it. There are times I took a downgrade in pay, even now some friends think I'm earning lesser than 'deemed desireable'' in society. But I'm happy (and frugal) and I'm living well beyond my needs.

Do not despair. You'll never let down your parents, as long as you do yourself fair and honest. 

Don't cut out opportunities. Don't focus only on local Uni/institutions and don't forget that this is not your final step in learning. You will always have an opportunity to continue in lifelong learning. It may not be now that you can do History, but you will definitely have an opportunity to do so.

Be proactive and continue asking anyone you know in poly as well. Ask for alternatives, if you don't the right answer keep asking and be persistent. If they don't know the answer, ask if they know whom might have an answer and ask him/her!

When I was young, I work part time to pay for my studies since I didn't had the support of my family when I go into IT. Things went well for me in the company, I was smart and respected so I thought job experience was more important than paper. Thus, I stopped after getting a diploma. But after leaving my job, I ended up in a weird situation. Everywhere a degree is needed, and this stupid requirement has made me feel like killing myself. It's not my fault that I cannot afford a degree. 

I'm not the smartest person but I'm not stupid either. I even won Singapore best startup but couldn't afford to go on the overseas mentorship opportunity. In the end, I failed my startup cause I had no money to expand too. Money always limit my options and money is not something I can simply go out and grab from a tree. Am I destine to fail just because I'm poor? And because I'm poor, I'm branded stupid? When I finally saved enough to go for my degree, my father had a stroke and I had to withdrew to pay for his medical needs. Is that my fault? Why am I so bad lucked?

Long story short, you aren't the only one who made bad choices but I'm still here and much older than you. It's nothing wrong to want to feel like killing yourself. We all have expectations, (be it our own or other's) and we try to live up to those. Virtual reality has also taught us that when things goes wrong, just reset. Windows crash? Just restart. Virus? Just reinstall. Real life interestingly works the same. But restarting or reinstalling is just a workaround method, its not going to help me when the same problem pop up again. So what I'm going to do instead, is make the best out of my time here, learn as much as I can from my mistakes and try not to do the same in my next life.

Then you have 2 options, depending on how much confidence you have in your humanities subjects and keeping :

1. Take private A levels in 2018 (sorry, 2017 exams already started). You'll finish around the same time as your current poly classmates, so not a lot of time wasted, and if you're confident enough in your own ability to cope you can even save your parents the school fees.

72qtnx,dnkl9al,"You're trying too hard to not be a disappointment to your parents. As someone who has been there and moved on, don't live the life that they want. You have 60+ more years to live. Are you sure this is the path you want to go? Odds are, half way down that road your parents will pass away and it won't matter anymore. I know it sounds harsh but sometimes you have to be selfish for you own sanity. Don't be that person who wakes up one morning in their 40s and realised they've wasted their entire life just to please others.   
If finance is not your thing, don't do it. Pushing yourself is not going to work if you have no interest. I know that quite well as a teacher.   
I've had a really rough teen years with my parents but it all went well. I was really rebellious and skipped school all the time. I only did this because I hated my course and I didn't know how to tell them. My parents didn't believe I was interested in a course only available in a private school. I dropped out of ITE, worked 3 jobs for 6months and made a deal with my mother to pay half of the school fees. I'm in the industry now and can finally prove to her that I made it and am really interested in my field.    
In your case, I understand getting to uni is pretty much impossible. Drop out. Stop wasting time. Find out if there are any private schools offering your course or if you can take the exams as a private student and study on your own. I think NIE might have something.    
My parents still hate me for the things I did when I was in a school but everything turned out well now and we have a great relationship. I wish that I had talked to her instead of being rebellious and a terrible daughter. Things will turn out well for you too as long as you follow your passion. Don't be afraid to do drastic things. I know it'll seem like a safer and more comfortable bet to stay in poly and just go with the flow. But you know you're screwed. Wake up and get out. Don't go the flow if you don't belong.

> The middleman alleged that he had met Su two days prior to the fatal leap and had assuaged him that he would find another job for him. He added that he did not expect Su to day that he wanted to return home the next day, or that Su would commit suicide.

> Su has been cremated in Singapore. His ashes will be sent back to his hometown in China.

46iprr,d05h4vk,"Absolutely heartbreaking, I can relate as I was a blur kid in army, its not smth that can be changed easily. I can relate to his troubles adapting, I got emotional and confused when I enlisted, cried in my room sometimes, having low self-esteem and slight depression from loneliness while trying to adapt to an unforgiving environment, sergeants n section mates calling me blur and all, but luckily I snapped out of it. It must have been turmoil for him deep inside with his family problems as well. Even though society has this perceived notion that ""if you cant even cope with BMT you are weak"", some people carry along a real emotional and psychological baggage inside them that intensify in this kind of high-stress/authoritative environment, causing them to snap and even suicide... this is something that the army should actively check for and provide active sources of help for enlistees even before/when they enlist, e.g. sergeants offering to chat with enlistees during admin time for any issues instead of an one-off formal event... because some people will not speak up for themselves until prompted to.

People react differently to NS, and a minority are unable to tolerate the training/work even though they might be reasonable. There is a certain degree of challenge in identifying such individuals, the ideal scenario would be that they undergo medical review and be given unfit-to-serve status.

Back when I was in NS as an officer, there was this general storeman who went AWOL for more than half a year with all sorts of reasons. I had to search for him. His store had almost no work, and the other storemen were just sitting around most days listening to music in the store.

46iprr,d05m5a4,"You are right, it is difficult to encourage this behaviour in such an environment. 


For the sergeants, while they have to enforce discipline and be strict, they can remind/inform their platoon consistently in the first few weeks on the avenues that recruits could seek help, be it through walking in anytime during admin time in their offices to chat about legitmate issues they face, or calling the counsellor hotline/sms service. They can also promote a helpful culture by reminding the platoon to help people who are more blur and people behave strangely/seem unable to adapt. Sergeants should not overshame anyone who often does badly/mark anyone and warn recruits who do so will be punished, but of course they should still be strict and enforce discipline. Furthermore, to inform that any recruit can take the initiative to raise it up to the superiors of anyone needing help as well.


In terms of counselling, a private box could be set up for recruits to write their problems and the counsellor will contact them, or even allow for SMSing a number anoymously. People who face depression would be unlikely to call the counsellor hotline themselves, and sometimes they do not want to talk to the superiors who are strict/fierce. Finally, sergeants interviewing each recruit could ask more relevant questions about the personal life of the recruit, giving reassurance to the person as well that it will be kept confidental and they are always available to help, instead of doing it like a routine job (for me, I did not feel inclined to tell the sergeant my problems because it felt like he was doing for the sake of doing it and did not feel confident enough to tell him my problems). Finally as the other user added, MO should stop behaving like douchebags and be more professional in helping people with depression.

1rbux1,cdm0g1z,"The PAP is very similar to American Republicans on economic issues.

Income inequalities due to capitalism are not properly corrected due to the excuse of ""work ethic, self-reliance, no hands-out"" blahblahblah, all of which only make sense when you ignore context

What is the context? That the cost of living in Singapore IS high when medical costs are involved (if you are relatively healthy the cost of living is still manageable), that many forms of economic labor (mainly unskilled labor, but also some forms of skilled labor) pay insufficiently, and the social safety net is unreliable

Of course, the government will ramble on about ""upgrading skills"", although common sense will tell you that a portion of our population will ONLY be able to do unskilled labor due to various deficiencies (mainly intelligence but perhaps also temperament, life circumstances, personality, age, etcetra). Politically Correct people will never mention this (and neither do most bloggers and academics) although it is such an obvious phenomenon.

What is the solution? I'm not in favor of a welfare state but i think its common sense to redistribute massive wealth inequalities. This would indefinitely result in lower cash flows and a decline in economic activity since Singapore would be ""less competitive"". 

Here lies the crux; do we want ""economic competitiveness"" or a more compassionate, commonsensical society ie Do we want more millionaires, or do we want a fairer, more egalitarian country? Since higher taxes = more redistribution but also = less economic activity = less millionaires

(The two are not necessarily exclusive, but in the context of Singapore and the way in which the government frames the issue and dictates economic policy, it is. Extraordinary government can accomplish both at the same time, but the present PAP leadership is quite mediocre (and this should be obvious to everyone via observing indicators such as decreasing quality of life, increasing unhappiness, election results))",9,junnies,2013-11-25 11:35:39,cdls9i9

South Korea conscripts are respected because they risk their lives against the ongoing threat of North Korea. Same with Taiwan with China and Israel with Hamas. People know they are protected through the sacrifice of these conscripts.

Singapore, on the other hand, is one of the only country with a peace-time full time conscription system, design to protect us against......who? Because we have people forced into government service to play soldier full time with no tangible enemy, they are seen more as ""paying their tax"" in the form of their time rather than actual soldiers.

This is despite all the 'success stories' of parents bringing up graduate children by working such menial jobs, especially in the last generation.

6xy943,dmjeiip,"I followed the case closely when the news first broke. It was a relatively straightforward case of suicide, but the grieving family blew up the matter into a full-fledged tinfoil hat conspiracy. IMO, the family refused to accept the possibility that their son had committed suicide because it was against their religious beliefs (his Mum is a pastor).

Most of the family's ""evidence"" of foul play was refuted during the coroner's inquiry by independent, US-based experts. For example, the family consulted their own ""expert"" who claimed that Shane had wounds consistent with him being strangled to death. However, [2 US chief medical examiners refuted these claims](http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1243390/us-experts-reject-murder-theory-shane-todds-death-singapore), and agreed with the Singapore pathologists' findings that Shane had committed suicide. When testifying during the inquiry, the Todds' expert witness [withdrew his claims](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shane-todd-inquiry-parents-us-based-expert-recants-finding-that-dr-todd-was-strangled) that Shane had injuries caused by strangulation. The Todds' expert witness also admitted that he was not a certified forensic pathologist and did not receive formal training in the subject.

The family also got their own ""computer expert"" who claimed that someone looked at Shane's external hard drive after he died (presumably the ""assassin"" who killed him to steal secrets). However, it turns out that this was simply the police who were looking through the deceased's belongings. This was further [corroborated by the FBI](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shane-todd-inquiry-fbi-backs-evidence-that-police-had-recovered-and-examined-hard-drive).",27,cowbungaa,2017-09-04 22:01:50,6xy943

and while i can't say much about assassins. there are tons of spies employed by MNCs and high tech firms to steal rival's technologies or patents etc. but it isn't james bond level stuff. far more mundane. and hardly spoken outside the industry.

but more to the case. the deceased was found to have left a note praising his employers and company which his gf found surprising cos he hated his job. 
 
and spf itself kinda cockup the investigation a bit. kinda feeds into parents view that there is a coverup. cos they never dust the scene for fingerprints to see if another person or assassin was in the scene. and they accessed his computer right there using password they got off a piece of paper instead of bringing back to their tech lab. 

then when found out in court justified their actions by saying official guidelines can be deviated from.

297au4,cii61i3,"I think I will try to give a more elaborate response.

Suicide hotlines such as SOS requires the suicidal individual in question to call them. They will not call the person themselves. 

As you are not close to her nor know her well I presume, the most straightforward idea is to inform her parents directly. This isn't the best solution but it is the ""safest"" option tentatively.

There will be people who advocate speaking to her first. Ideally if you are capable of reaching out to her, knowing what to say and knowing what not to say, this is indeed the best approach in preventing her from ending her life if she was indeed contemplating such. However, the reverse can also happen if you say the wrong things or approach this in a manner where she feels uncomfortable. 

My view is, first assume the worst as in she's thinking of suicide and treat it as a very serious situation. However, in your words with either her or the parents, do not jump to conclusions that she is thinking of such but rather gently approach it in a ""you are concerned about what might be happening"" stance. 

If you speak to her parents, the responsibility will then lie on her parents to address the issue with her. If her parents don't handle it well, she will panic and feel worse but then this leaves you off the hook since the responsibility is no longer yours in a way thus the safest option for you. Someone on suicidewatch mentioned this as well.

In the hospital I was questioned by the police, I didn't dare to tell them I jumped, so I just said I fell and didn't remember what happened. I was a coward.

After the incident my parents seemed to understand and stopped the caning practice. I was still nagged on daily, though I had a lot more free time for myself.

58qzql,d92upbl,"> ""She heard her lamenting in Mandarin, saying 'I only asked for 70 marks, I don't expect you to get 80 marks,'"" Insp Ong added.

I'm going to say it: Some people really don't deserve to be parents. This mother is one of those people. I know next to nothing about them personally, but what I've read is enough to conclude that the boy's grades were just the tip of the iceberg in the list of reasons that drove him to suicide. The bulk of the iceberg is most probably parental abuse and neglect. 

A friend of mine thinks that the boy's suicide was his own fault. He thinks the boy was just weak-willed and chose to escape from his problems instead of dealing with it. I've tried to convince him that this might not be so, and that it takes more than being simply weak-willed to drive a person to suicide, but he's adamant on not changing his view. 

Also in case anyone is interested, here's a quote by DFW on the nature of suicide and depression:

> “The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” ",55,doctorwhybother98,2016-10-23 00:32:09,58qzql
58qzql,d92yrve,"No sympathy for the boy's parents. The boy is only 11 years old, what does he know about coping? Especially with parents like that. So many stories of young children committing suicide because of exam results, not because they personally feel like they could have done better but because they are afraid to face the wrath of their parents. Dying is better than their mother/father caning them for not getting *insert number* marks or a certain grade.

It is just primary 5. Sure, the PSLE scores will show what stream you can enter and which school you can go to. But parents need to stop being so fucking delusional. No, your child is not going to  be the next president. Stop expecting him to get into RI or another elite school.

Parents like them are so fucking disgusting. And where do we hear news like this? Singapore. Everything must be about grades, marks, good schools. All this bullshit implanted into our brains, ingrained in our society since young. This has to stop. What are they doing to our future generations? No wonder birth rate so low.  Your child might end up dead before he even turn 12! 

Please, anyone reading this or who have read the article, if you think grades are everything and getting into a good school is #1 priority, don't ever reproduce. All parents want the best for their child, yes, but if you can carry a human being for 9 months and raise him for 11 years, then treat him like that because of numbers on a paper, you are not fit to be a parent.

And Singaporean men, if your wife is acting that way to the fruit of your loins, why would you continue letting her treat your child like that? Stand up for your kids, man. Don't be a coward and just give in to your wife, let her do whatever she wants. That kid is your responsibility too. You helped make that child. If you're going to be a pussy, might as well you kill yourself too, so you don't have to deal with the heartbreak of losing your child and the regret of not saying/doing something to prevent your child from committing suicide.

1) his sister has probably faced the same kind of neglect and abuse that /u/doctorwhybother98 guesses they've experienced, 

2) She's probably in some position of authority as her older sibling to be able to do or notice something, but now that her brother has chosen to jump she will live from this day with a guilt of not doing more to intervene,

3) As the stress from 'O' levels piles up, she *will* need support. She will need some consolation from both her brother's death and her mother's callous attitude. And if her father is going to live in denial and believe his son fell to his death, that's a house she's not going to find a home in. 

Suicide isn't the first option for children. They deal with stress in many ways - spending more time with friends, staying away from home, looking for someone or someplace where they feel safe and belonged. If the boy's sister cannot find a support, fast, she will break down sooner or later and I imagine she may not rule out her brother's choice. Thankfully, with attention on their family I am hoping that she gets help - else, here is a shoutout to her:

There will be many days where it seems as though everything you're trying is just a stopgap measure, and that because your default is unhapiness, you revert to it the moment whatever momentary pleasure you managed to claw for yourself fades. 

Keep plugging at it, though! 

If you've been prescribed meds, take them. If money isn't too much of an issue, search for a therapist until you find one you like. Be gentle with yourself, surround yourself with as much positivity as you can, and occasionally give yourself a reward for trying hard. Give it enough time and you'll develop enough perspective to realize that you're actually making progress.

8oi7so,e04ghq6,"You are looking for a solution with an immediate tangible effect. There is no such solution except benzodiazepines. Even the SSRIs take some time to have effect. 

Since you know what caused your depression, my view is that doing the opposite will alleviate it. 

Schedule a time to join a group activity which you have some interest in and attend it faithfully whether you feel like it or not. 

That is a form of medication because the act of going out and talking to people effects changes in your brain chemistry. You take your medication whether you feel like it or not right? That’s the same for these activities. 

Same goes for your exercises. Have a routine. Of course don’t over do it. Moderate intensity but regular routine is key. The endorphins and the natural sunlight that comes with the outdoors is a form of medication. It modulates your dopamine and serotonin levels respectively. 

Control your stress levels, don’t take on too much responsibilities. 

Your sleep might be affected. Still, schedule a fixed time to go to bed. And sleep early like 9pm. 

You won’t see changes immediately. There’s no panacea. Just small changes you can make in your life to tilt the brain chemistry back to normality. Check back with yourself in 6 months. Keep a journal to see your progress. ",9,normificator,2018-06-05 16:32:46,8oi7so
8oi7so,e04hmph,"I'm sorry that you're struggling, but never forget that you're not alone in this. Plenty of people have been through depression and still going through,including me. I got bullied myself in my primary school days and it still haunts me until now (I'm turning 30 this year). I sought for help at IMH and manage to connect with my therapist, and had sessions with her for a year and a half now, and I admit I got lucky because many people had to switch therapists to find one that they can connect with. Here's some personal opinions on how to manage depression a little better, I don't know if it's helpful or not,but my intention is to help you understand better.

1) Unfortunately, depression won't go away. But you can manage depression better by understanding yourself. Be mindful about the thoughts that come to your mind, and analyse them why they're hurting you, and see if you can find a solution for it. It's like problem solving, problems will always come, but you got to keep solving them, and in return,you learn more how to prevent these problems from starting in the first place. For instance, I always had this low self-esteem,self-bullying behaviour. After looking through my thoughts, I know it's from my past experience of being bullied that my bully had left his impression in my mind, because I know I've been neglecting my own self for many years. 

2) Your happiness cannot be compromised. It doesn't matter what others say, not even what I've written here, but if you can find your own happiness, then never let go of it. I can tell you a whole load of stuff to do, but you have to look and think if it's helpful for you, that it'll bring some joy and happiness back into your life.  Personally, I think you're trying really damn hard at seeking help, i.e. seeing therapists/counselors, taking meds, exercise etc, and these are steps that helps, even if they only bring brief moments of comfort to your life. 

3) Also, everyone reacts differently to pain. Just because it doesn't seem painful to others doesn't mean it's not painful to you. Do remember that there's light at the tunnel, but my opinion is that without the darkness ,there's no directionality to go to. (Darkness represents pain,sorrow,negativity while Light represents positivity and happiness) With this in mind, I understood better why I had to go though all my painful experience to reach this point of my life,and it's because without the pain, I have no sense of direction to head to to get better. I find that there's a purpose in suffering, even if those in pain can't see it. 

I hope this helps, and don't worry if you disagree with any of the stuff you said,and anyone can feel free to reply if they feel confused or anything :)",6,Zedwye,2018-06-05 16:51:51,8oi7so

Also glad to hear that you are taking meds and will second other posters who mentioned that it takes a while to kick in. It might be hard to stay compliant to the medication due to the side effects but i hope you will continue to do so! 

I also second Silver Ribbon for that free counselling, not sure if you’re looking to get more regular healthcare but I can recommend Singapore Association for Mental Health, their Insight Centre provides counselling for mental health issues. Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) does mental health consultations for youths, and they have a physical space at SCAPE for you to speak to youth peer support workers if you need it. 

SACS is one I would highly recommend but more if you want rehab services, they have day rehab or residential rehab, and they provide counselling as well. They’ve got quite a few branches around Singapore so you can choose one that’s convenient for your living location

Should you need it, here are a list of hotlines you can call:
 
IMH: 63892222 (24h)
SOS: 1800-221-4444 (24h)
SAMH: 1800-283-7019

I think it’s a good thing that you’re seeking help, so maybe research on the topic and read up on mental conditions? I’m not an expert but maybe it could help you to understand why you feel the way you do, even if it’s little. As for things to do, try to read books and broaden your horizon.

8oi7so,e04jdz7,"As someone else mentioned, I'd recommend Dr Lim from gleneagles but he's a private psychiatrist so money might be an issue.

Anyway as for self\-help methods, I typically write things out in the form of poetry/exposition and if it gets really really bad I text a friend and ask them to keep me company/rationalize thoughts for me. Otherwise I pretty much just ignore the episode and promise myself that it'll pass with time and I force myself to go on a run or something \(this happens to be the case most of the time during the semester\). On the days where getting off my bed to go for a run feels like a herculean task, I pretty much just drop to the floor and do a bunch of push\-ups. Or play video games. I recently just splurged on the PC version of Ni No Kuni II, but I guess I can only afford to do this since it's summer now.

8oi7so,e04mjnv,"First off, I'm so sorry that your previous experiences were all so terrible and I can't say that I know how you feel but I have had similar experiences with bad therapists as well.

I'm assuming that you've done a lot of research on where to find good therapists so I'll just leave it at that.

But for self-help methods, I would first recommend that you start off slowly. For me, I started doing small tasks like cleaning, decorating and repainting my room to my liking. Small tasks set you up for medium tasks, and slowly you can move on to a new life. I cannot stress how important it is to surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are and people that are positive and comfortable to be with. Throw away any ""toxic"" relationships you may have and hopefully, you can slowly see a change from within.

I hope what I've said was somewhat helpful and if you need more information you can always drop me a DM, I'll be more than happy to help"")

PS: Just one of the thing I did when I was down was to exercise. I always felt much better after a work-out and getting a toner body definitely helped me with my self-confidence.

I wont lie, it will suck at first as you force yourself to do it but will help more than any anti-depressants will. Rather than trying running as you mentioned (which is super boring tbh) try something more social or something that has a long term goal with clear progress. Badminton, a martial art etc.

Well as for how I sort of cope with it is through music/anime as both let me escape from reality somewhat. Through playing musical instruments(self taught myself piano and guitar so you don’t really need a teacher if you’re worried about that stuff), I feel like I’m in my own world where I’m in control of everything, while through anime, the story telling and such helps me think in the shoes of the protagonist and forget whatever’s happening irl.

8oi7so,e04vn7h,"Hey, i'm so sorry that you have to go through all of that, and it must be really tough for you right now. Last year, I went to CHAT to get a free mental health assessment, was referred to IMH, but it didn't work out so I emailed CHAT again and they referred me to a different organisation. I have been receiving counselling from TOUCH ($20 per session) for 6 months now. You can try using CHAT to get referrals and find a counselor since it's free and they really do help you. 

My first counselor was the school counselor and it was clear that he didn't really care about long term help. My current one from TOUCH, is extremely helpful. We go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and it has helped me a lot. It takes some time and effort to find a therapist that clicks with you and it's entirely normal to change your therapist a couple of times. But once you can find someone that clicks and understands you, it truly becomes the beginning of your recovery. 

Honestly, it's not easy. It's so hard even right now. When I first started my counselling sessions, I was still extremely suicidal and it lasted for 3+ months. It's too complicated for me to even write it out but my emotions and self hate was intense and it was a week of happiness, and a week of turmoil. Sometimes, i'd crawl into my wardrobe, curl up into a ball, close the doors and cry. Even now, a small part of me still believes that I am not deserving of happiness, and I still think of self harm and punishment.

 I would say that who I am right now is made up of 30% counselling, 40% Practicing the CBT methods on my own, 10% Self-Help books and research, 20% changing my lifestyle. 

With mental health, people can't actually help you or change your life for you. They can't wave a magic wand or feed you high doses of pills for the rest of your life to permanently cure you of your illness. All they can do is provide advice, support you and arm you with the techniques needed to deal with your depression.

When I first started, we focused on the negative thoughts and learnt how to combat it, there was a lot of meditation involved too. As we progress, I started reading educational books on the side about depression on my own(""Bipolar, not much"" is a really good book because of how much I was able to resonate, and the information provided helped me so much. Borrow it from the library). With counselors, communication is really important too. I read ""The bell jar"" and even though it did trigger me, it helped me shape my emotions to words so that I can express them better. Then, I started doing small changes to my life. I shifted my bed closer to the window to get more sunlight, I took walks at night, I started doing c25k which is a program that starts off jogging from 1minute intervals, to 30mins which would eventually help you run 5k. 

Started volunteering at an animal shelter to gain confidence when talking to people, I kept a private thought journal which I used to pen down how I feel, so that I can discuss with my counselor during the next session. I went from 1 session a week, to every 2 weeks. Tomorrow, i'll be meeting my counselor and it would be a three week gap from my previous session. I changed my social circle, got involved in a reddit discord group which focused on a healthy lifestyle and losing weight.

 Mind you, all of this happened within 6months. I took it slow. I wasn't happy all the time, it was never a single light switch, there wasn't a fire that suddenly started burning inside of me. Nope, it took so much time. My moods constantly bounced, there were days and sometimes two weeks where I just felt terrible, there were days where I want to turn to self harm, there were days when I just wanted to stay in bed and cry. Right now, I wouldn't say that I'm ""fixed"" or ""Healed"". I still have my ups and downs. I'm still anxious about my future, I don't have a dream or a goal. But my counselor told me that i'd need a year. Maybe for you, it will take a year or two too. But you need to keep swimming. The fact that you made this reddit post is already proof that you're resilient. You want to fight, you still want to have a future. So remember how you feel and keep swimming. Keep moving even in days where you can't. Set bare minimums for your daily life. You don't want to wash your face or groom yourself? It's okay, at least take a shower. You don't feel like jogging? It's okay, just go for a walk or roll around your bed. [Here's a video/song that honestly pushed me to get help. The show itself was a huge mood booster since the main character wanted to get help and get better too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK2DlLmVc20) This [is also a really good ted talk that I listened to about depression.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) He mentions a man that he met who went through all sorts of therapy and took so many types of medicine. Despite trying so much, the depression still stayed. In the end, the man went for a brain surgery which successfully helped him. Even though he went through so much pain, he still chose to fight and live because he still carried hope deep inside of him. "" And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more."" Remembering that helped me a lot.",4,porowhale,2018-06-05 21:17:03,8oi7so
8oi7so,e045wec,"Hi, you probably already knew this but depression is caused by chemical imbalance of the brain and the negative emotion you felt are due to the broken down communication system in your brain.

I read that you are taking medications and that is good. Maybe you can adjust your medication intake or try other types of medication if the current one are not helpful enough. There is no one size fits all approach in treating depression. Trial and error is required to find the correct medication formula for each individual. 

I am troubled by the fact that your physiatrists stopped caring after a while. To put it bluntly, they are paid to care. If they are impatient towards you, they are frankly bad at their job. Please don't be disheartened by them and seek for a better physiatrist that can truly help you. ",2,sageadam,2018-06-05 13:33:46,8oi7so

Doing a group activity thing regularly is something I did not think about and your comment gives me a different perspective to doing it even if I don't feel like meeting people. Do you have examples on that? I don't have too many close friends, so one thing that comes to mind is perhaps taking up a course like cooking or baking? Not sure if that counts.

8oi7so,e0gcu3g,"Hmm. Apart from a child psychologist I gelled especially well with in my youth, I don't think I've seen a therapist I thought of as especially helpful. It's more a reflection of IMH's system rather than the doctors' skill, though. It's hard to build a relationship with your doctor when you see them only for 30mins every two weeks. Then again, the last time I had a session was slightly more than 5 years ago. Am not sure if things at IMH have changed since then.

Oh since you like animals, have you thought about fostering newborn kittens if you've the time to do so? It's super rewarding and a really good distraction from negative thoughts. 

I know how it's like to be so depressed that you can't even muster up enough energy to brush your teeth yet alone exercise or take a bus to wherever it is you're supposed to be volunteering (in your case, SPCA). But with neonatal kittehs that need to be fed at 2-4 hourly intervals depending on how young/sickly they are, you're kinda forced to step up to the plate to tend to them whether you feel like it or not. It's tough but very gratifying when you see the kittens thrive.

Perhaps you can try group exercise. Like a hiking group, sailing group, cycling group or rock climbing group. Has both the benefits of exercise and social activity. 

For indoor activities you could try yoga, Pilates, meditation, board games groups, musical instruments, discussion groups etc

If you’re spiritually inclined u can choose whichever religion piques your interest, these tend to be the most social but you might fall into the trap of professing things you don’t believe in because you treasure the social group, but some people are ok with that. So it’s your call really.

8oi7so,e0ffoqx,"No worries, I appreciate that you take the time to respond back to everyone's messages. I'm seeing both psychiatrist as well as therapist, because they both handle different aspects of my depression. A psychiatrist is more knowledgeable in precribing/managing/assigning the medicines that can help improve your mood, while the therapist is more about changing your behaviour (psychology). Personally, I think seeing both professionals are crucial in my recovery because both work together to piece together the fastest possible plan to manage depression. So like,some things you can say to your therapist is like why you're avoiding certain things, or having certain mindsets, while for a psychiatrist, you'll want to ask him/her things like why I'm feeling nauseus after eating medication, or having trouble sleeping. 

My therapist's name is Miss.Cheak Ching Cheng, but she's on maternal leave,so I'm switching to another therapist and continuing from there.

i'm in this odd place because i have bipolar ii as well but my symptoms were far milder than everyone else's. there's the usual loss of motivation and inability to feel any sort of reward or fulfillment (dopamine/ serotonin not working i guess) and constant anxiety over nothing, but nothing like not being able to get out of bed for a few days (most ive gone through is one or two). and when im high i just feel very uncomfortable with who i am. 

im very stable now, although im almost certain i will relapse in the future. most people do. but yeah i think you understand that there is a sort of solidarity amongst people with mental illnesses, and i feel like i had it wayy too easy. i don't wish i had it worse just for authenticity or anything like that, it was harrowing enough, and it took me nearly 10 years to get past it (early teens haha) but still...

The best way to know is of course get diagnosed by a medical professional. 

**However, like any mental afflictions it is almost always the people around you that notice rather than yourself. Now this is where things get iffy. Due to the lack of awareness in mental health, many signs tend to get missed out by both the loved ones and the patient themselves. **

Patient: Paiseh, scared ppl say me siao lang

Loved ones: he liddat one lor, huh no la not siao! later other ppl see you wierd. 


So I would like to raise up an important point: There is nothing wrong about having a mental illness. It is just like any other illness. People take insulin for diabetes, so I take lamotrigine for my bipolar anything wrong? 
Its a social stigma thing really, and we have to get rid of it because many people are suffering in silence and ironically, it is the loved ones that cause them most pain. 



But generally speaking, Bipolar 1 is extreme mania and depression. Bipolar 2 is hypo-mania (less severe) but major depression. 
Mania is actually quite scary if you ask me. Severe cases of mania are those who are deluded with ideas like they are superman and can fly. Due to their unawareness of what is happening, some 'commit suicide' that way. Major depression is basically a high risk of self harm (suicidal attempts). Hypo-mania is a lesser form of mania that is usually not jialat but may be good in some instances like heightened creativity and very energetic. 

As the condition's naming suggests, bipolar sufferers swing from one mood to another constantly. There are also other 'in between' called mixed episodes but I will not talk about it here unless someone else asks. 

Some people have asked me, is it like girl's periods? I don't know honestly. Need to ask a girl with bipolar for that question haha. But bipolar is NOT multiple personality disorder.

Edit: Sorry, missed out on 2nd part of your qn. 
When I was in NS, my depression slowly crept up on me. As the days went by, I was getting worse so I knew I had to seek help. Because I had prior experience of depression I can self identify if something is about to go very wrong. When I knew I was about to break, I quickly sought help. Then again, NS still has a long way to go about aiding the REAL patients so it was a terrible and tedious experience for me. I'm glad its over now. ",16,swimNotsink,2016-09-04 08:44:45,d7845q7
50zhik,d78q8cb,"There are quite a few I've heard such as it being the same as Borderline personality disorder (multiple personality) or that its like schizophrenia. But of course, they are not the same. 
I do agree that mental illnesses are very abstract and difficult to fathom but there is also the big issue of social stigma that prevents people from understanding them. If more open discussion and education is being done, we can slowly eliminate this stigma. 
This is what is happening now: ""Mary is diabetic la, she can't drink soda""
What I hope to happen in the future: ""Mary is depressed (or any other mental illness), lets give her some space to let her relax."" and not ""Oi, wet blanket sia! So anti social one you"" 



When did I realize I might be bipolar? I knew something was wrong and with my history of depression, I could tell that something was not right. After I went to consult a doctor, then I was officially diagnosed with bipolar. Here's a part which I posted to someone's question earlier.

50zhik,d7849fj,"Yes, you can put it that way. 

Its not that you literally become a 'vegetable' of sorts but rather it feels like that. 

Like I mentioned, the medications typically interact with your brain chemistry muting out stuff so usually undesired results may happen as well. 

I've had such a instance before on anti-psychotics and its not a pleasant feeling. You just feel very empty inside and nothing interests you. Even sleeping all day feels like 'ok I sleep' rather than 'ok, going to sleep'. Its quite abstract la. 

Add: Probably another easier simulation would be the feeling where you are 'looking at someone' but your mind is focusing on somewhere else. So you get that 'blank' stare thingy. Except in this case, your mind is empty. ",3,swimNotsink,2016-09-04 08:34:19,d7844kf

I'm not sure what you mean by doctor's experience but for me, my psychologist (who I was consulting in my teens) recommended him to me.

If you're talking about public vs private, I have no idea on how to compare cuz I didn't get a chance to try the public one. However, I know of a friend who sees a gvt psychiatrist and she says its good. ",6,swimNotsink,2016-09-04 08:48:18,d784gdw
50zhik,d786np8,"Yes I went through BMT. Was Pes C when enlisted. After BMT in tekong then posted to somewhere to continue training for stuffs at the new posting which separated us. Some from same platoon same posting as me. But I don't really socialize other than my bunkmates and sadly none were with my posting. No one really knew my condition because most of us know how to hide too well. But in my new unit, at the 1st book out I took the courage to tell my encik  (privately of course) that I am going to seek help and he supported me. The whole unit was very supportive in a discrete way and there were also some seniors who have depression so they could empathize and I am forever grateful for that. They didn't downplay such issues at all. 

But because NS will persistently try to post you here and there to let you serve the nation 'comfortably', I got bounced to another unit in another location whilst I had to regularly report to the MMI (military medical institute). That new unit, the people are nice but my first impression was really horrifying. The female superior wanted to speak to me on the first day. She asked something like 'so what is your problem? why did you get posted here?"" I told her my history then she proceeded to laugh and said something like ""aiya just emo lah, don't worry, this unit good one"". I do understand it might not be intentional but its because of such interactions that downplays us, makes us even more hesitant to seek help and suffer in silence. 
Also I'm not saying this is a fact but I feel that the way NS scrutinizes us like we are all kengsters actually makes it very distressing. The best thing I did in my short NS stint was to seek help from a private psychiatrist. I know we'e all heard the stories about 'private doctor write letter down pes!'. But not all of us do that. Some of us really need help and in terms of help rendered in the amount of time, private is the best way to go. In the NS environment you can be charged for many things and its very stressful really. 

Also I must add, you are not allowed to seek outside help due to rules and whatnot. I couldn't go to a private doc at first because of such regulations so  my best bet was to go to IMH. Its very funny because there was this indian doctor that was seeing me and I told her my predicament (I wasn't allowed to seek help. MUST see superior first to give approval). She literally called the unit and fked them. It was really funny. Its small issues like this that makes it even scarier. Government hospital can fight with the 'rules of NS'.

I wouldn't say I'm very social but I'm slowly coming out of my shell and being able to do things by myself (such as going out shopping alone). Sounds like mundane tasks but its a big step really. For most depressives, trying to 'go back to how it was' is not easy and it will never ever be the exact same. 

Without meds, I was in one mood state or the other. Quite awhile when I was un-diagnosed I had these anger-irritated episodes at my family and usually locked myself in my room because I couldn't 'concentrate' on my assignments. But now that I think back, it was actually one of the mixed episodes (I say 'I think back' because it is very difficult to be self aware about your state of mind if you aren't experienced; so at that time, I didn't think anything was wrong). It wasn't that bad for me but I could have a better quality of life if I got my condition under control. 

With meds now,  I am able to organize my thoughts better. Now that my mood is largely stabilized, I'm not hindered too much by the different moods and slowly take back my life.

People who know about my condition are those I trust and they don't really care honestly. There may be the occasional joking on 'wa don't need serve NS shiok leh' but otherwise, its no big deal. 


I wish to be able to stop taking any medication altogether in the future but deep down, I know its unlikely since my problem is likely due to brain chemical imbalances. Every review with my pdoc I discuss about lowering the dose / being off it altogether but it probably won't be anywhere near soon. But I must say initially when I was off any anti psych and just on lamotrigine, it was at 400mg. Now its 200mg. 

Medically speaking, regarding the long term effects of psych drugs I am unable to give you a definitive answer cuz I don't have the knowledge. But the worsening of condition due to long term taking is not unheard of. Which is why regular visits to your pdoc is important. Such issues has to be raised and medication can be changed / titrated. But typically long term 'problems' are due to side effects like lithium's liver damage.

However, put it this way: Do I really have a choice? Yes some people are able to manage their condition with psychotherapy (talking with psychologist) without medicine but not all of us are lucky to be able to do that. Ask any diabetic / asthmatics if they could be off their mandatory medication and all of them will tell you 'bo bian; no choice'. ",1,swimNotsink,2016-09-04 18:48:53,d78dtax

Honestly, your friend doesn't really need to care so much. Its his/her life. Already got a record in IMH, already got a pes F. But so what? its not like you can do anything 'special' to remove these. This is the very first step in taking back your life. It is just understanding that you simply happen to have more 'information' in your records but it doesn't make you less than any other person. You just need to take medication and make changes to your life so that you can manage your condition better. If anything, people with mental illnesses are mentally stronger than 'normals'. We deal with so much shit inside our heads everyday and still able to function like any one else. (just my personal POV) You might be surprised to find out that quite a few successful people do have mental illnesses too but they don't use it as an excuse to not succeed. 


We've all heard of 'pes F jialat, how to find job?'. I've been hearing a lot of these scary tales before enlisting from non pes F people. Even though I haven't have first hand experience yet, many experienced co-workers I've met in my internships have told me that there's no such thing as 'hard to find job cuz of my NS history'. They just care about your work and whether can you bring money to the table or not. (which is logical). 
The pes F scrutinization may hold true for certain goverment jobs though, like those dealing with sensitive info like MHA etc. But otherwise, most private companies dun really give a crap about your history.

50zhik,d78r87s,"So far I don't have any real experience in a government psych clinic (except MMI in NS and a short consult at IMH) so generally speaking, can't say for sure. But with regards to MMI, I can see that they are trying but probably they don't have enough resources to help. For eg. there was a case (before I went to my private psych) where I had a bad reaction to the meds they gave me and I was feeling lots of anxiety and suicidal. I called them and they told me ""orh, just continue taking, its like that one. You need to make an appointment then can see doctor"". I mean seriously? If someone had a reallllllly bad trip from the medication, I think after that phone call they would probably *fly off* somewhere liao. Maybe they understaffed or whatever but yeah, this is not a good thing at all. I'm no professional but if any medicine is giving you bad side effects, you should immediately seek a doctor. Even more so regarding psych meds. This is where having the capability to find a private psych is extremely beneficial. 

Government psych I heard from my friend who is seeing one says its ok and they are helpful. So I guess the only downside (like any other gvt hospitals) is the ridiculous long queue. As for IMH, I wouldn't say its good or bad based on my short consultation stint there. But I guess the impression I got there was that it was kinda gloomy (probably due to the lighting or something). But they're not aggressive like those abusive type of facilities you see in tv shows haha.

In my teens, I've seen a total of 2 psychiatrist and 1 psychologist and later another psychiatrist (which I am seeing now). The first one I couldn't stand him cuz he like bo chup one then doesn't even look you in the eye to understand how are you. The 2nd one arrogant and then thinks I'm just trying to skip school. Recommended to my dad that I either choose to go to school or admit into a hospital. Of course I wasn't well so I choose the hospital lor. But it was expensive cuz private.. so after about 1 night there, this psychologist came to visit me and said she comes on her free time to help young cases like mine. I could connect with her so I've been seeing her in my teens for about 1-2 years and then stopped since I got a grip on my life in poly. 

Then in NS bla bla bla, went to see my psychologist again and she recommended me to the psychiatrist who she thinks is able to help me with matters pertaining to NS. And that's history~

If you ask me, it is important to find a pdoc that you are comfortable with. Based solely on my experience, there are 2 types. One has more empathy while the other is logical. Some may prefer one over the other but in my opinion, empathy seems to be lacking in most.

Self diagnose is never ever a good thing. Sure, there may have been cases where a particular person 'caught stuffs' early on because they think they're smart but its never reliable generally speaking. So far I haven't done any 'tests' a doctor would give me? But I'm pretty sure doctors can tell if someone is lying or not. (excluding sociopaths and actors)

Some people like to ask 'am I depressed? Do I have <mental illness>? ' 

I'll say this though: Everyone experiences some degree of feeling depressed but its just a matter of the severity and duration of it. Anything negative that stays on prolonged is never good. Its like if you got a stomachache, you'll probably just brush it off and attribute it to something mild. However, if you start to realize that it begins to happen more and more constantly, you'd automatically think of seeking a doctor. Its pretty much the same with most mental illnesses. BUT the main difference is that it is very difficult to be self aware and that you have to depend on others to point it out to you. When I'm in hypomania, I don't think 'omg I got hypomania', unless I actually ask myself,  am I having an episode right now? Many of us without experience, don't really ask ourselves such questions because its unnecessary. So many of us tend to 'slip' into these states of mind that we are not aware of. (which is why insanity cases do carry weight). 


For other symptoms such as hallucination and delusions, it is very clear what you should do. Just like high fever or constant diarrhea, its a red flag.

I went through that phase of ""I seem like so much more functional than others, am I really bi polar or just psyching myself out?"". Honestly though, just focus on the fact of you taking medication. Do you go off the rails if you don't take your meds? If you don't, maybe you can discuss with your pdoc. If you do, then there's your proof that you indeed are bipolar / have whatever type of mental illness.

I will say something like 'Yah, now study uni lor'. They don't usually proceed to ask anything further.

Well there is a difference actually. You see, before you shit you feel something is coming out. And after you shit, you feel your bowels cleared. You have an idea of what is going on. You can even feel if the shit is halfway or fully out already. 

Now, bipolar mood swings can happen at a snap of fingers. We normally don't even realize it until its been awhile. Like my first attribute to tiredness would be ""oh didn't sleep well last night la"". When actually, I could have already slipped into a depressive mood. As the hours go by, 'symptoms' would start to show which would confirm if I'm having an episode or not. It takes experience to recognize and able to self reflect till the point where it sorta becomes instinctive and you roughly know if something is on or not. Ok put it in a gaming context. You see the boss didn't cast debuff on you but your hp keeps dropping minimally. Then when you notice your hp red only then you realize you got some form of debuff which you didn't know about.

Generally speaking, I feel that those born after 1990's tend to be more open minded and have access to a lot of information to read about such conditions. Its like the gay rights thingy where more of the younger generation is being exposed to information that allows them understand about what it is etc. But I don't think the reality of mental conditions is at that stage yet unfortunately. 
Yes some people who are totally ignorant will inadvertently hurt us with their comments. If I'm feeling up to it, I will try to explain to them but caution that this may elicit some backlash of you being a prick so... yeah. Otherwise, just stay far away lest it triggers your condition etc. 

My family is the conservative type so when I was having these first symptoms, I didn't know what was going on. My family also didn't know what was going on. And this is a very dangerous thing because when emotions run high, small things can turn into physical altercations. (if they don't know what is wrong, they assume something else so misunderstandings start to snowball then... well it never ends well)
But now that I'm stable, things are okay. We don't share stuffs to be honest, and we never did.

bipolar ii too, although it's very mild now thanks to lithium and me having spent the past 5-6 years building an incredibly strong support system and untangling deep-rooted issues. 

i went via the polyclinic route because it was cheaper. from experience if you inform the GP seeing you that your case is severe and you need immediate attention you can get an appointment on the same day. not always, but followup will be real quick. 

/u/swimNotisink is right in that there are two types of pdocs, and the polarity (hur hur) is even more obvious in IMH. i dont blame them, theyre overworked and drawing a paycheck that isn't amazing, answering to this massive bureaucratic system. 

so yeah, you may find a few pdocs who keep their head high and make you feel comfortable enough to open up, but most of them are just here to diagnose you, give you your medication and have you fuck off till your next appointment. 

and of course because they see like a billion patients a week and rotate roles ever so frequently, you won't always see the same doctor and neither can the doctor remember your issues and you have to tell your entire life story again. it can be infuriating. it's better than nothing though.

that being said, IMH is pretty amazing in that the system takes patient feedback and welfare very seriously. i went through a few of those 'unempathetic, logical' doctors before i decided that it was hindering my treatment. told the hospital, now im seeing the same senior doctor for the rest of my time here (which is incredibly infrequently actually, im stable enough that i can afford to see him once every few months)

im generally very cynical about bureaucracies but i do think the system for IMH looks out for its patients, or at the very least, responds to patient feedback. i think consensus is that private doctors are still better for all the reasons listed in this AMA so far but IMH is definitely not incompetent.

if your condition acts up do note you can walk into their A&E any time, costs around 100 or so though.. but as with polyclinics you can talk about financial issues with one of their counsellors and work something out. ",1,sadface-,2016-09-04 22:37:48,d78rhfh

If people say you keng then let them say lor. Its your life and there's nothing wrong trying to protect it. Doctors also cannot suka suka just give you diagnosis anyway. 

Just remember that in NS, its like a paradigm shift. The 'laws' that apply to a civilian do not ncessarily apply to NS. So yes, its veeeeeeery messy and can cause many problems. ",1,swimNotsink,2016-09-04 22:59:18,d78vr6l
50zhik,d795ajy,"I'm no expert on NS laws but I didn't take this from reading somewhere. It was communicated to us (in NS). There's a similar general rule and that is to 'always report to your camp superiors first and never ever go ahead outside; only when they approve then you can do whatever you want'. 

I haven't actually seen what happens if someone went ahead to break these (pretty sure punishment of likes would be hush-hush anyways). But one of the consequences which can be linked to any NS policies is that you can be charged for a lot of things; detention barracks is hardcore. And with the 'ambiguous threats' that is being put nicely, it becomes very unsettling for someone with mental afflictions under that system. AWOL is not an option, in camp also too stressed out, what can I do? If i seek outside help will I be charged? Even if I go out and straight to IMH, they also have their hands tied due to 'NS regulations'. Yes, there is such a thing. Don't get me started on how the 'you only need to know / ask questions relevant to your rank' is even worse for people like us.


Whether or not these constraints / directives are legit I cannot verify. If you've been through NS before, the culture there is such where its not uncommon for lies like these to be construed by the higher ranked to benefit them. You would also know different camps have somewhat different practices which makes it even more complicated.


If there exists a resource before enlisting to read up on all the regulations to prevent being 'smoked', I would recommend it to anyone about to enlist. But as far as I know, there isn't.

Don't worry about this too much. The way that the SAF operates after a tragedy occurs is to always err on the side of caution, and if I know those backronym obsessed pencil pushers well enough, I'd say that they already have some simplistic flowchart out there which automatically sorts you into a vocation which won't exacerbate your condition. They will also most likely be posting you to a unit where there are at least a few SAF counsellors, and where the officers and NCOs will have knowledge of your condition. This will ensure that your basic mental welfare is assured. At the same time, people have short memories, so remember to seek help immediately if you are under great emotional stress.

regardless, whether it's purely an ""attention seeking"" or whether he ""really wants to die"" (in quotations bc these really really depend on the situation, and can be very judgemental and unhelpful in many cases) the fact that he physically hurts himself as a response to negative emotion is NOT good and should be addressed in some way.",2,,2018-03-19 03:36:40,853vim

Just remind him that help is there if he needs. In the mean time, it'll be a good idea to call SOS and let them know about the situation. SOS also has an e-mail befriending system if your brother is interested (replies in 48 hrs on weekdays). All those aware about this situation should also read up on how to help individuals with suicidal thoughts (i.e. What to say/what to NOT say, etc.)


If your brother does decide to seek help - Great! SOS is great for emergencies. Otherwise, you/your brother can book an appointment with CHAT for a check-up, or head down to any polyclinics associated with NGH as those are the ones with psychologists.

67o63t,dgrvrzx,"Hi there,

You seem to be in tremendous distress now, but first things first: Is there any way that you can keep yourself physically safe for now? Are there any sharp objects or pills or ropes nearby that you could keep away from reach or give to someone else for safe-keeping for the time being? If you live in an apartment, can you lock your windows and have someone keep an eye on you for the next few days or so?

If at any time you feel that you're going to be at physical danger to yourself, you dial 995 without hesitation, okay? Alternatively you can walk-in to any A&E department at any hospital.

I can't promise you that things will get better, nor can I tell you that you shouldn't kill yourself. It would be morally unjust for me to make that decision for you, because this is your life, after all, and you get to decide what to do with it. 

Things are tough now, and I get that, because I've been where you are before, twice (and I identify all too much with your ruminations, so you're definitely not alone in thinking and feeling those things), but I have to say that there definitely is help available - all you have to do is want it for yourself, which you seem to already have accomplished, so kudos to you for that! :)

Another thing I should add is that suicidal feelings are not natural, and are temporary by nature, however permanent they might feel presently. 

Regarding your concern about the cost of therapy, you can receive subsidized treatment by going to a polyclinic and getting a referral to see mental health professionals (psychiatrist; psychologist). At the hospital, you can ask to speak to a Medical Social Worker, who can provide you with the subsidies you need as necessary. My payments are currently covered by Medifund for the next couple of months, which has helped lessen the financial burden of treatment. You do not have to do any of this alone - reach out to your loved ones for support if possible.

You're really brave for reaching out the way you've done, and I cannot praise you enough for that. Just take it an hour at a time, a day at a time, and keep breathing. 

My realization since my first attempt six months ago is that the good days, though they may be few and far between, are worth living for, no matter how ugly the bad ones get. 

If you need a non-judgmental listening ear and an outlet to just vent, feel free to PM me at any time. I hope you can find the strength to pull through this crisis. Do [take care](https://i.reddituploads.com/81b1167bca5f4253802e399771798329?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=650ade81000e686612bfb7217dbc8d7e)! :)",164,doctorwhybother98,2017-04-27 05:54:24,67o63t
67o63t,dgrykfy,"TL;DR:

End your life, and you will NEVER get a second chance. Continue living, look at nature, observe human behavior and try to learn about the reality you inhabit. Life is Shit; Life is also Beautiful. Shadows always appear because there is Light.


I had suicidal tendencies, even tried to .... At the very last second before I pushed off, someone called me to stop. I looked around, nobody. Learnt later that it really was someone; that someone inhabits the same body as I.

Had more suicidal and murder tendencies, got a little insane. That voice will always calm me down, tell me to kill instead.

Nearly did the deed, someone stopped me. Instead of running away screaming. He stood there blocking my way, telling me not to waste my life behind bars, that it is not worth it, NEVER worth it. 

He and his friends later become my best friends; we are all closely knit. They all know about my insanity, all know I am a ticking time bomb. And they constantly remind me that my life is priceless, I get only one shot at life, always look beyond the darkness and you will find light.

They are my counsellors; whenever I am in despair, they always come personally to look for me and talk to me, calm me down, keep my sanity. I owe them a lot. The other person also became less... dark, and more positive. I never consulted a counsellor. I doubt a paid stranger's ability to enter my life and influence it positively.

I mended my relationships with my Dad, I try to soldier the bad times and look to the good. I found somebody I dream of a future with. 

I still suffer from 'breaks'; just that now, I have people who actually care about me, who remind me that Life sucks because Life is also beautiful. Where there is Light, there are Shadows. With all their positive energy, I suffer less 'breaks' now.

I am now learning to communicate with people, and with myself. Organize my feelings, rationalize my thoughts. Life is bad, but Life is also good.

I cannot claim to understand fully what you are going through; I am not you, neither are you me. Find your own path, keep good friends close, love your loved ones. Always remember good things come at the cost of bad, and vice versa.

All the best to you; if you choose to end your life, it may not be a bad choice. But for all we know, you could already have recovered and are living a better life in a different timeline. Why not make that timeline your current one? Its worth a shot.

Please dont feel this way. I believe you are an awesome person IRL. 

My own depression set my own relationship on fire. It went downhill. 
Both my ex's hated me. I felt horrible. 
Both also decided to go find another guy shortly after the break up which broke my heart even more. At that point of my time, I really felt like killing myself. The one you used to love hates you and went on to date other guys. 


I seeked help from friends and family etc.
I realize it ain't my fault that my relationships all went downhill. why? I met and dated toxic people which I was too blinded by love to see.

I have the tendency to think too much, which causes me to be easily insecure and mistrustful in a relationship. These problems of mine eventually come to become theirs', which causes them to feel trapped in the relationship. So they leave.

It probably doesn't matter how my relationships ended; maybe you encountered similar issues with yours or not. I only hope you know that you are not alone; I feel your pain, and I think I understand it.

I don't know about you or your background, but I hope you have people in your life who you love and loves you, as well as personal interests/hobbies. Pursue them! I crave that kind of relationship as well, but it's not integral to a happy and fulfilling life.

Also noted that you labelled yourself 'horrible, useless, and a lost cause'. I think you're really thoughtful and unselfish to not let your problems infect him, and you're great for that.

You can always talk to me (us). Wish you the best; hope to see you happy again!",2,Fylyn,2017-04-27 07:21:50,67o63t

I'm not born optimistic, and so are all of us. But happiness is never about the end result of being happy, it's the journey through it.

Life is a journey on a rollercoaster ride. It's darn boring if the ride just goes up, it's the up after the down that's exciting.

Surround yourself with positive people, find peace in yourself and be comfortable with who you are.

Let yourself go sometimes, get drunk, wasted, go for a run, meditate or just doing nothing. Whatever clears your trash bin. Even computers needs to be shut down time to time.

Finally, the odds of you or us being born in this world, is 1 in 400,000,000,00. We are lucky and more importantly, each and everyone of us are unique and special.

I don't know why I'm writing this to a stranger publicly, but I have learnt to appreciate things in life, my friends, family and myself. And I hope you will to! :)

67o63t,dgt3o75,"Dear /u/IAmThatAsianGirl,

You're on the right track by asking for help. It's not a shameful thing to ask for help, and it's not a sign of weakness. You asking for help means deep inside you believe you can get better.

I've been on the same boat as you. Very recently, in fact. I just got out of one of those really long bouts of depression that I have that goes on for weeks, even months.

The most important thing to know about depression is that it's a state where your brain lies to you. It tells you awful things that are absolutely untrue. You've got to keep that in check. Keep it in the back of your head that depression is a filthy liar. If it helps to make you feel better, talk to a friend you trust and make them your accountability buddy. Or talk to a few friends and ask them to help you in little bits. Personally, I just want people to listen to me, I don't really expect anyone to give advice. I am aware of what I have to do, I just need to feel connected with people. Surround yourself with people and don't isolate yourself. Isolation makes depression worse.

That's my 2 cents on this thing. I'd just like to thank you for posting this thread. As a person who goes through depression a lot, I wasn't aware I had options like https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg or asking for a referral from the polyclinic so I could avail cheaper services. I wish I had known these sooner so I didn't have to go through what I just did. I'm now going to contact these people to help me with my mental health. Please do, too.

We can get better, OP. Hugs.",2,zjomea,2017-04-27 20:06:24,67o63t

67o63t,dgsywgw,"Hi there.
First of all, I am so glad you decided to reach out, even if it is to strangers on reddit. 
I understand that it takes a lot of courage to acknowlege that you are having issues and to tell someone about it. However, I still hope you give yourself a chance. While redditers have been kind and supportive, getting the support from your loved ones (friends and family) may be more helpful (speaking from personal experience). And getting professional help is crucial. 

You are definitely not a hopeless case, no one is. In fact, the fact that you want to get help is a huge step already.

About the cost, if you are a Singaporean, it is actually relatively affordable. 
In any case, you may want to see it as an investment to a better you and a happier life.

I just want to share to you this link:
https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/ (if you are between 16 to 30y.o)
If you haven't already known, you can make an appointment with professional volunteers for free to assess your mental well-being, and they can give you referrals to IMH or polyclinics at a cheaper price. Do take a look at their website and if the thought of going there alone scares you, bring a friend or family or anyone (I would love to help if you need someone). I hope you are feeling better now, take care and all the best!",1,thechchlc,2017-04-27 18:19:49,67o63t

Depression, a bit of OCD, and anxiety all kinda come together and it is annoying to deal with it but it helps to talk about it and be reminded there is more to life than relationships. Focus on work/school, being fit, healthy, and enjoying your hobbies and the rest will work itself out. ",1,cityoflostwages,2017-04-27 19:27:50,67o63t

If life is like the way it is now, then life is pretty pointless to live on knowing that I can never run away from these life. Even though I dont consider what i am feeling now to be suicidal but the thought of it in a way can be demoralizing.

Currently im 1 year into my first job as a 24/7 IT support and pretty much you are on a 24/7 standby for work. Even on my off days, work might just pop up and might have to start worrying about my work again. Personally for me, I find a hard to simply ""switch off"" from work and I always have a tendency to worry about them. 

I have noticed that even since I started working Im prone to falling sick. I can go on a few years without seeing a doctor but even since i started working every 2/3 months I might need to see a doctor for my illness. Im not too sure if what I am experiencing now might have impacted my health but I have been coughing for the last 6 months even after frequent trips to the doctor (both western and TCM), there is no improvement. While at the same time am also suffering from some kind of a stinging pain all over my body and this only started around 4 months ago.

When you're already serving NS, especially in the Army, commanders have to deal with many kinds of medical ailments and have a difficult time trying to identify how true the serviceman's condition is because let's face it, many try to get out of doing things they don't like as a solider. You'll experience a mix of skepticism + fear-of-lawsuit/family complain type behaviour from your superiors.  
  
My advise is declare, for several reasons.  
  
1. You have a proper diagnosis from a recognized (government) institution. MINDEF (or the relevant unit/body) have to keep track of these. Don't waste your time for healing/self-improvement, etc in an army camp. 
  
2. High-stress environment in NS. I don't know what your reasons were for trying to end your life and we won't probe but it's likely stress-related. You'll experience getting shouted at/abused verbally by your sergeants and such. There's the physical training aspect of it as well, which isn't as simple as just running and doing some pushups. You know your own mind and body.  
  
3. Legal ramifications. While I'm not entirely sure of this as I haven't kept track of military laws in a long time, there probably would be certain bits and clauses that would be inconvenient for you should you not declare your condition and happen to suffer an incident related to it.

Tl;dr I think serving NS as a normal soldier is very bad idea for me because I am going to try and kill myself in ever more creative ways again if they let me near weapons and pointy, explode-y things.

I have already started practicing for the real world. I work in a STEM field doing some pretty cool stuff that thankfully still mildly interests me (extended from my H3 science research), plus I'm getting a paycheck for it. I haven't gone through NS so I can't comment if it is good practice for the real world or not, but I've had a bit of a head start. If I do get classified as PES F, all hope and potential experience is not lost.

I am not that intimidated by the social stigma of being classified as PES E/F. I'm mentally ill. My first suicide attempt was at the ripe old age of 17. The stigma has already been established. I frankly don't give a rat's ass if people do stigmatize me for being an army reject. My main concern now is trying to protect myself from harm whenever possible, something I can do now while I take a short break from my bi-weekly depressive and suicidal spiral.

Can I ask, were you placed in a non-clerical vocation as PES C before your downgrade?",2,monanalisa,2014-12-17 11:49:03,cmwl2hk
2pgx76,cmwtflt,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I really appreciate it.

I've just always been like this - consistently piss poor mood, low energy, suicidal ideation; textbook symptoms - for several years. I only started realizing something might be wrong in the past few months, but I didn't want to get help. There's no significant pressure from school or parents. I actually do quite well in school, usually top 5% and above (below?) and let's just say my CV is much longer than what it's supposed to be at this age. JC is admittedly stressful, but it wasn't what led to my attempt. I did it because well my life sucks. Sure, I have a refrigerator and running water, but I don't remember what it's like to be happy. I can't remember the last time I genuinely enjoyed doing or laughing at something. I'm just not that interested in living anymore. Shitty genes, I suppose.

At the point of my attempt, I felt so indescribably lonely, isolated and hopeless. To put it succinctly, I can think of a hundred reasons to die, and a hundred ways to do it, but not a hundred reasons to live, nor a hundred ways to do it. Anyways in the months leading up to the attempt, I got close many times (attempts of the attempt? heh) doing weird shit like counting the number of pills and staring at the bottle for hours. I did lots and lots of research reading papers, case studies and meta-analysis of papers and case studies regarding the toxicity of my drug of choice. I was pretty obsessed.

I am terrified of serving NS. Not of the physical rigor, but of the mental one. I don't have problems with fitness (school team & crazy training schedules). I am terrified of the prospect of being given access to firearms and explosives. I have had dreams and fantasies of finally, successfully and irreversibly killing myself. Drug overdoses have antidotes and treatments. Bullets and grenades are much harder to treat. I have had fantasies of running away with grenades and generously applying them to my face. I actually feel slightly happier fantasizing about all of this. How fucked up is that?

I finished my A levels last month, and in the *first freaking week* post-As, I stayed in bed for four days and seriously wanted to kill myself again. I just didn't have access to any lethal means. It's been consistently hard the past few weeks, especially since I don't need to go to school regularly anymore (yes, I like school because it keeps me busy). It's not school stress that does it - with or without stress I will be fucked up either way. In fact, I think school helped to keep me focused and busy with something. The extended banality of NS is going to set me off *even more* and I don't know if I can pull through that.",2,monanalisa,2014-12-17 11:32:28,cmwl9jy
2pgx76,cmxh7kq,"I'm not delirious. I apologize if any part of my post(s) indicated that I was trying to pass off as crazy or insane.

I have a mood disorder. It's a different class from things like severe schizophrenia (what you would typically view as delusional and crazy people). I am perfectly capable of rational reason, although sometimes I lose the motivation to do rational things, like seek help, or ruminate and essentially delude myself.

My brain chemistry is so messed up that I have trouble with happiness, motivation and self-preservation. I have stayed in bed for days at a time just bawwing my eyes out. I suppose part of the stigma is that I'm just not trying hard enough or that I'm lazy, or just looking for attention. I assure you, it's not that simple. Have you ever wondered why depression is documented as a mental illness? To say that being able to tackle it with sheer willpower alone is challenging, is a gross understatement. Sure, some people have managed it, but they are the exception, not the rule. Look at mental illness as a physical one - you can't just ""try harder"" your way out of a fever when you have a flu.

My mother thinks I'm malingering. She accused me of trying to keng my way out of serving NS, by creating all this drama and that I shouldn't declare because I don't need to. This was three weeks after I was discharged from hospital, after I stayed in the ICU and psych ward on suicide watch. I don't know how to convince you that I am depressed if my own mother doesn't completely believe me. 

I'm sure NS is a one of a kind experience and that you can learn valuable lessons for life. I've listened to enough stories from teachers/friends/colleagues/family to pretty much confirm it. The problem is, I am not like most people. I'm scared of NS because I might one day show up on the headlines for eating a grenade. 

Let's say I do serve like a normal soldier. What the hell do I do if I hit a really bad episode? Confide in my CO? My section/platoon/whatever-mates? First word of suicide and I'll be held under involuntary psychiatric hold that can be extended indefinitely (yes it can be extended for as long as the shrinks think you present a danger to yourself and others). So with this fear in mind, I'm not going to seek help, not like that. What now? Take the easy way out and off myself. It's not going to be difficult with access to weapons.

I'm not too sure about OCD treatment, based on what I know, mental illnesses can only be managed, not fully cured. (I might be wrong though)



I'll try my best to reply you if I'm free, feel free to ask me more questions.


My recommendation to you is to write down a list of possible symptoms you have, as that was what helped me in my IMH NS Pre Enlistment checkup, and consider if you prefer budget, or healthcare wise.

7tzfub,dtgjw0f,"IMH outpatient doctors are pretty caring but a few don’t really know what they are doing. It is greatly subsidised if you get a referral from polyclinic. Some are still getting their masters/phd. But it’s better than nothing. Talking to them might help you, although it didn’t for me. Just know it will be a really slow process and even slower progress. Be patient.    
   

Each session was less than $50 per hour. Ive not been to any other subsidised clinic so I can’t give you any information on that. However, I have the impression that NUH would be better as I have a few good friends working there. Although I may be a bit biased.    
You can definitely not let your parents know. However, it is better for them to know for your own mental health. They can be a good support system for you.   
   

Medication wise, it is really cheap if it’s subsidised. Xanax is the cheapest and pretty effective for panic attacks or anxiety. It’s around a few cents per pill. And it’s a take when necessary kind of pill.  
   

Private clinics are around $150-250 per hour.   It is definitely better but also I’ve discovered that they like to push expensive drugs.   
&nbsp;  


If you do decide to go get help (I strongly suggest you to since you have stepped up to be responsible for your own health. Congrats btw.) do take note that bad things might happen. Triggers will show up and it might get worse at first. Tell your doctor. And for god’s sake don’t do anything stupid that’ll land you as an inpatient. The horror stories are true.    
Soldier on. And don’t expect to come out with a ray of sunshine on the other side. From my experience, all I could do was to keep my demons at bay. But it was better than thinking  that I’ll always be broken. It’s not true, I’ll never fully heal, and that’s okay.    
    
You’ve decided to do this. It will be a long journey, but you have to start some time. Start early, cope early. I wish you the best.

5y1l6d,demo64b,"Your line of questioning unsatisfactorily conflates a whole host of issues.

Individuals in such situations are deemed to be mentally incapacitated and are deemed to have a diminished sense of responsibility. This means that, at the moment of the crime, the person was unable to understand the nature of his actions, exercise rationality, or even exercise self control, among other things.

The court's determination of the individual's mental capacity is aided by professional medical knowledge and expertise. Is this assessment always clear cut and certain? No; the human psyche remains complex and nebulous. Nonetheless the court's findings are grounded in medical fact.

At any case, it was reported that the Prosecution itself sought a custodial sentence rather than the death penalty. This is indicative that it was not in contention that the defendant was actually mentally incapacitated at the moment of the crime.

As an aside, I would caution all readers to look at news coverage of court cases & legal proceedings discerningly. The news often fails to adequately capture or explain subtle nuances in the law. In cases like this especially, far greater attention is cast on the sensationalist nature of the crime and that may warp our appreciation of the actual issues in contention.",47,OmittingCaesar,2017-03-08 11:11:39,5y1l6d
5y1l6d,demqqxu,"I think the focus should be on rehabilitation and containment rather than punishment, and this should be true for all crimes, but even more so for those committed by the mentally ill. 

The 10 year sentence is more of a deterrent for society than anything else. Of course anyone can claim to be mentally unstable, but if this guy was indeed going through a psychotic episode, his actions were not intentional. The word intention loses meaning when you're in the midst of a psychotic episode. 

Is he a danger to the community? Yes. But consider this: if a man has a tumour pressing on his brain and commits murder because of that, should he be given he same sentence as a ""sane"" criminal? No, because his actions were not his own, it was the tumour that caused him to commit the murder. Were his actions intentional? No. His brain was not functioning properly.  

Let's take another example, let's say you have a disorder that causes you to be violent while asleep. So you go around hitting people while asleep. Now, you have no idea that you're doing this because you're sleeping. Or, you might have some idea, but you feel unable to wake yourself up and stop. What shall we do with you? It's quite clear that your disorder is causing you to act in such ways and you have very little to no control over it. When you wake up in the morning you feel nothing but disgust for yourself. This is not who you are, there's a huge discrepancy between who you are when awake (where you do things with intention) versus when asleep. We can throw you in a jail for 10 years. It might be necessary, but hopefully, when you are there, the focus will be on rehabilitating you. Maybe we can come up with a safety plan for you, maybe we can identify what triggers your disorder. Perhaps you need medication, perhaps you need to ensure that every night someone ties you up before you sleep. Working on a plan is what will keep you and society safe. Throwing you in jail for 10 years won't be any different from throwing you in jail for 20 years.

5y1l6d,demy86j,"Based on the title you have given this topic your questions seem very loaded. Your thought process also shows you don't really understand mental illness and why its mitigating in this context. 

Theres a bit that goes into psychosis that has probably gone on in this case. Its not just hallucination, its a delusion. Guy probably didn't just see his girlfriend as the devil, he really believed it. Add to that it comes with a fugue state of mind. 

Much like the court will charge children and mentally impaired differently due to their inability to understand what was done, the mental illness defence often relies on that. I think this should tell you what I feel about the first question. 

To answer your second question, short answer yes. Long answer, its situational. Lots of people have mental illness very few end up killing others. Its not something they choose. Without knowing how severe their ailment is, its unfair to push judgement. Example, would you push for a fine if a diabetic was drinking coke on the train? I wouldn't have an opinion on it until I know how bad his diabetes is. That coke could have saved his life, but if not he should be fined like the rest of us. 

As for the sentencing, with point above in mind, its quite clear he was delusional at the time. In his own defence, he does admit to knowing he was killing her, however. He's not making an innocent plea with the mental illness, he's using it in mitigation to reduce the sentencing. I personally feel its a bit long, compared to mediated crimes committed by sane people, but the defence itself asked for that length so, I'd be happy with it. 

Btw mental illness does recur, but is often better managed subsequently. Especially those who are treated. Yes, he would be a danger, but the mental illness would still be a strong mitigation factor for his case. And, yes, it is brief. Meaning to say didn't last long enough to classify as chronic, usually 3 months. ",7,dyliecious,2017-03-08 14:11:25,5y1l6d

5y1l6d,denafns,"I'm guessing he'll probably be institutionalised if he's still seen as a risk. 

Your worry is that if 10 years will be enough, yes? It seems like part of the worry might have come from the news article itself. Reading about how he gouged out her eyeball can easily give the impression that he's a dangerous monster who deserves to rot in hell. News articles are written this way for a reason -- they feed on our fear, we're naturally structured to respond to sensationalism and that's why it sells. It sells & divides: it creates a ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality because we feel threatened by the presence of such ""monsters"" amongst us.

From what I've read, this guy was simply delusional. Psychiatrists are well equipped to deal with such cases. He truly believed that the woman was possessed. What caused this ""brief psychotic episode""? You're concerned that it might happen again -- and yes, it very well may. But that's what doctors are there for. They can teach patients how to take care of themselves before their episodes escalate. There's often a crisis plan in place for such people. 10 years is more than enough to treat such cases and get them to a place where they are able to function in society. And from what I understand, they often have to adhere to a treatment plan even after they have served their sentence, especially if the doctor deems it necessary. Of course this is assuming they have proper system where patients receive adequate psych treatment in prisons. But I suspect it's probably overcrowded and there may not be enough treatment for all patients, so that could be an issue. But even then, 10 years should be enough. I'm neither a lawyer nor a doctor though, so take what I say with a pinch of salt. 

This would be a far more complex case if he were a psychopath, which from what I've read, he isn't. Psychopaths are harder to rehabilitate. That's when I would question if 10 years would be enough. Psychopaths are excellent at manipulating. There have been cases where they would convince everyone around them that they are completely rehabilitated in order to get out early, and then they would go out and commit the same crime that got them incarcerated. Many psychopaths are functioning members of society, but there are many who are just too dangerous, and these are these are often the people that need to be contained, and again, not because they are monsters, but simply because their brains are wired differently, and for our safety, they need to be locked away.

First things first, I'm 27 was working a shitty job like you when I first graduated. Stayed up to 3am for a week at office during crunch time and once even reported to client's office at 9am the next day to do UAT. I was doing 5 projects at once and around the time I quit at 6 months, I was the 2nd most experienced person in my role. I had constant heartburn at that job due to stress, stupid clients and lack of sleep.

I'm at a much better place now that pays more than 2 times of what that job offered. I seldom do over time in my 2 years of working here unless absolutely required. I like what I do and I get along well with my colleagues, well mostly anyway.

So now you can see our previous predicaments were pretty similar, on to you.

> Took the first job offer that paid the most right out of uni (banking / consulting etc, don't wish to be too specific). Had a terrible 5-6 months there of late nights and the excessive stress caused me to turn to anti-depressants.

Banking is like this. That's the thing they don't tell you when you apply to the job. I hope you knew it was going to be like this before you signed up for it. It's quite well known that people talk about the magic taxi ride that bankers do.

> I cracked and resigned, telling myself I will take up an ""in-between stress-free"" job somewhere and continue finding something I like. I'm currently working on my ""in-between"" job and applying furiously to every opening I can see.

That's fine. Take it slow and easy. Burnout isn't fun. I basically did nothing for a month when I quit my old job but everything I enjoyed but didn't have the time for. Go hit the gym or run. sleep early and eat properly. Your health is the one thing you'll want to look after while you're working at your ""stress-free"" job.

> In truth, I just have absolutely no idea what I want to do in life. I tailored my entire academic curriculum and internships to pursue the coveted consulting / banking path and everything went out of the windows in <6 months. I felt the ""lost in life"" moment on one 2 am night when I was working on a powerpoint deck and looked to my left and saw my 40 year old boss beside me doing the same. For the life of me, I couldn't picture myself doing the same til 60.

**This** is your biggest problem. And I and no one else in the world can help you with it. You need to know what you want in life or you'll never get it. Maybe you had some ideal that working in banking would be your dream job, ask yourself what part of banking was attractive to you? Or even better, ask yourself what do you find meaningful in life? A job doesn't need to be glamorous or high profile or really easy (or challenging depending on the individual) but in order to sustain an interest and passion for it, it **must be meaningful**.

> Go to work, go home, watch some tv shows and movies, hang out with friends on weekend. I'm single, have no girlfriend and literally spend the day waiting for time to pass. I no longer have any motivation in life and I can't find a single thing that inspires me.

As I said earlier, that's all good. You'll need some time to recover from burnout and take it easy for a bit, but you'll need to give yourself a deadline to get back to reality. And what's wrong with not having a girlfriend? Don't get into a relationship because you miss relationships, get into a relationship because you like someone. and you feel they can bring as much to the relationship as you can.

> The thought of the rat-race makes me nauseous and interacting with my friends (who are fantastic people) reminds me how everyone seemingly has it all together and I'm simply wasting my life away in a pit of emotionless, mindless emptiness.

The rat race is only a race if you make it so. Life is a game and the thing is, everyone decides the ""Win"" conditions by themselves. If you play a game where the goals are determined by the very people you are playing against, that's a sure way to set yourself up for failure. Don't let someone decide how you should live your life. Live your life the way you want to.

Tl;dr: You're burnt out, take a short break, figure out your goals in life and get back in there and kick ass, champ.

in short, the spiritual answer is that meaning and fullness and purpose in our lives happens when we are connected to our true nature/essence, but as we grow up, we eventually disconnect from it. the answer is to reconnect with our true nature/essence, remove the psychological conditioning that veils us from it, and recover our trust, fullness and joy in life",1,junnies,2016-01-30 12:23:34,436v51

2lgoo8,clulwk5,"Hello friend,

Let me start off by saying that for someone who is presumably still in secondary school, your articulation is superb and it will serve you well growing up.

Next, let me preface this by saying I do not speak for all Singaporeans in this subreddit. However, allow this 26 year old guy who has gone through the system to share some of his thoughts. 

Having gone through the entire education system (primary -> Secondary -> JC -> Army -> Uni -> Working life) and coming out of it, I would give my arm and a leg if I could turn back the time to my secondary school days. Without a shadow of a doubt, those were THE ABSOLUTE best times of my life. The friendships forged, the times spent, the things learned, the experiences experienced were and still are some of the best till date. Again, this may not apply to everyone but for me and alot of my close friends this sentiment holds true. 

I think what could help is to always remember that life is not about the destination. Life IS the journey to the destination. In Singapore, a common mindset is that we are always PREPARING for something that lies ahead. primary 4-6 preparing for PSLE to get into a good secondary school, sec 3-4 preparing for O-Levels (or N-levels) to get into a good JC (or poly major), JC 1-2 preparing for A levels (or Poly finals) to get into a good university and finally in university preparing for finals to get a good job. Focusing so much for the future, we sometimes forget to just LIVE in the present. 

Enjoy the time you have now. Enjoy the friendships you forge now. LIVE the present and you will find things get easier as you go along. I am not saying to just throw preparations out the window and just do everything on the fly. At the end of the day we MUST have a destination in mind BUT that should not stop us from enjoying the journey there.   ",47,Celwind,2014-11-07 03:49:15,2lgoo8
2lgoo8,cluoj9z,"Not a Singaporean (ang mo - know and love the country), but a Dad who worries about getting the balance right, and a boss who recruits others (software engineers, as it happens).

You are an articulate and focussed student, and have much to be proud of - simply based on the content of this post, which I am sure isn't your best work :-)

If you know the material, supplementary classes and tuition really don't help that much. Drop at least some of those for subjects where you are strong, and keep them for the subjects where you are perhaps less talented. If your parents don't believe you, try pointing them to [this article by the headmaster of one of the top prep schools in the uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10421123/Children-left-exhausted-by-endemic-tutoring-culture.html).

While I would probably point to my University days as the best of my life, your secondary school friendships will be the bedrock of your life. Cultivate and enjoy them.

Find time for things you love - whether sport, art or culture, they will help you to define who you are and what to as you grow.

Learn to use your time well. Negotiate with your parents that if your grades are good and you work hard, you can have some time for yourself.

Singapore is expensive, sure. So are most countries, but in the end most people manage OK. I promise you that a happy and fulfilled life in an HDB in Bishan beats an empty life in Condo above ION any day. Money is only one of many things that matter. People with interests and friends can have a fulfilled life without a wallet full of credit cards

One of the best experiences of my life was backpacking around Asia 10 years ago. It cost me about SDG20 per day

In short: be proud of who you are. Celebrate your achievements, but work hard where you are less strong. Make at least some time for things you love. If you have a strong sense of yourself, are articulate and passionate about something, you will succeed far more than yet another clone with 13 'O' Level at 'A' grade and no understanding of what they have learned.

2lgoo8,clulwxb,"Coming from a uni grad and totally understanding and experiencing what you've described, here's what I have to say:Yeah it's tough, and you will definitely have to deal with it because it's one of the more terrible things that is entrenched in our culture. Most important of all is to never lose that interest in learning because of the workload and stress. Also, always have an end goal, not just finish that assignment and do well in class. If something catches your attention, read up more about it, don't just take it as just another part of the curriculum. It gives meaning behind merely mugging.Dump the tuition if you think it doesn't help. Honestly ask yourself I it is your safety net,  or if the teacher is actually helping you understand how things work, or is he /she just giving you solutions straight without you eve n understanding? I found myself dumping my tuition and bucking up by learning through understanding why back in J1. Never needed tuition again.  Find a cocurricular activity you love, and you will look forward to it at the end of school everyday. Set a specific non marks related goal for youself in school, like aiming to be good in English for example, but instead of through marks as your focus in maybe aiming to get published in a school magazine or something. For me, I always loved art, and my aim wasn't really to be top in art marks wise, but rather top in my dedication and interest in it, such that people would know that I love it. The marks will follow that, and it gives meaning to more than numbers.Honestly free time is a lot about working smart, like paying attention in lectures because it means understanding90% of the content first time through. But at the same time, figure out ways to just enjoy yourself while doing it. Study with friends rather than yourself, it's easier to find the support you need when you are stressed and at the same time it keeps studying from being dreary.Most importantly, it's all in the mind. One day at a time. Life is gonna feel overwhelming if you think so far ahead and of all the things you have to handle. For now, just take it as it goes, one thing at a time. You'll look back and laugh at yourself next time.",11,Brikandbones,2014-11-07 03:50:01,2lgoo8
2lgoo8,cluqbch,"Hmm. Lots of people have given you great stuff to think about. Some good comments up there. I'm going to try to provide a bit of perspective.

Unlike /u/Celwind, my secondary school days were some of the worst of my life, and JC wasn't far behind. Uni and grad school were some of the best. In secondary school and JC I wasn't a good student, but I did what I needed to scrape my bare ass into NUS (I also scraped my bare ass into JC). School is competitive, yes, but at some point you'll realise (hopefully sooner than later) that you just need to get in. You don't need to be absolutely #1 at everything to get in. Sure, people at or around #1 have more options, get more scholarships, etc. But imagine being 18/19 and trying to figure out which program to apply for that'll set you on the course for the rest of your life. A bit unreasonable, isn't it?

What's the solution to this? What really bugs me about the Singapore system is how irredeemable failure appears to be. Failure is set up to be this end-of-the-world kind of scenario. It's not. What I've learned is, if we fail, we just try again. Or go do something else. Possibly something else that makes you happier than what you thought you wanted. There are uncountable ways of living life. You don't have to do it everybody else's way.

The best thing my parents ever told me when I was younger was ""if all your friends jump off the building you'll go and jump too ah?"" That sentence set me on the most different route I could ever have imagined. By the end of my undergrad when I was preparing to start my MA program my mother asked me why I wanted to study so much, why couldn't I ""be like all my friends and go to MOE and go and teach"". I said, ""ma, when I was a kid you told me, if all my friends jumped off the building, I go and jump also?""

For someone who almost repeated sec 2, almost didn't get into JC, almost repeated J1 (I was actually barred from my sport CCA in J2 because my grades were bad - I had a prime position on the team, and had to give it up for the tourney that year), almost didn't get into NUS.. I have a PhD. It's been a funny little road.

Right now you've got to pay your dues to get where you need to be going. That's your secondary school education at least. But at the same time don't give in to the competitive mentality of having to be #1 if that's killing your lust for life. It's your life. You live it. With all its consequences. Life hasn't been easy (it isn't, it'll never be), but you don't have to run the rat race. You can take yourself out of it.",10,phdee,2014-11-07 07:24:16,2lgoo8

Even if you become a 'one-percenter' your projects, timelines and life will still be tainted by these people who do sub-par work. 

So why? Why do break your back, staying in school and poring over notes and textbooks? 

The reason why, is because of the ultimate resource you have: willpower. Willpower cannot be bought, but it can be trained, little by little. Think of each and every single time you refused to give up as a milestone in which your willpower was increased over the previous day's. Eventually, you will accrue enough willpower to render you nigh-invulnerable to those who set others back by their ineptitude. Your reservoir of willpower will allow you to push your work and projects through with sheer grit.

2lgoo8,clusdov,"I'm a Sec 4 student, and O's are about to end in a bit, so I feel that I can probably spare some help for you.

Firstly, please, please, please calm down and find some relax time. I've had friends sink into depression because of stress. My teachers have told me stories of people dropping out of school because of all this pressure. Please don't let this happen to you. Find a hobby, go out with friends, get your mind off school. These school years are going to be the most relaxed years of your life. After this, you're going to have to take care of yourself. No parents to buy you food or pay your utilities, no chance to meet all your friends daily, no chance to randomly waste time with your buddies at the mall or something. Plan your days out. Don't spend your weekends with your face in your textbooks. Ask your friends if they want to chill somewhere. These are supposed to be the best years of your life. Don't throw them out the window.

You said ""So then, what is the point of living my life?"" That's the thing about life. There is no point. We're all going to disappear eventually and everyone has limited time. What you do or I do is not going to matter in the end. Heck, our Earth will end up disappearing eventually. So? Why are you stressing out then? Live your life to the fullest while you can. Have as much fun and happiness as you can get while you can get it. You're a secondary school student. You have plenty of time for this. 

If you worry about something, chances are things will not end well. Do not continue in life assuming things will be bad, because if you keep going down that route, they will turn out as you expected. Look on the bright side of life. 

If I can say 1 last thing to calm you down, it's this. Don't worry about O's. Sure, it's very important, but its difficulty is overestimated by too many people. IMO, this year's O's were easier than the past 5 years, to me at least. If you understand your subjects, pay attention in lessons, do your homework on time, you will **NOT** have trouble. Yes, you will have to study, but you don't have to spend the whole day doing it.

You won't feel indignation either at the tests to be held right after term reopens, just resigned. 

Haha I don't know if this is a too-pessimistic view, but it's the way I'm feeling right now. 

I'll be taking my As next year. I'm also fighting against my parents' insistence on GP tuition and a new math tuition class (they withdrew me from the one I really liked because I've had straight Us this year). I'm tired of feeling like nearly every conversation I have with my family starts or ends with a discussion about my grades. 

I was telling my grandma about the changes in my CCA, and she said not to go next year because I have my As. I said it's not up to me to decide. And before I went to bathe, she talked about how if I get kicked out of JC, i wouldn't be able to go to uni, and I don't know...

My day starts with school, and when I go home, school follows me. I don't really mind the work (I really should work harder), but I mind the endless discussion over the kids' academics at home. 

I feel like my family increasingly defines my person by my grades, and that how I conduct myself academically is how I am as a person, like I'm not myself when I can't be defined in relation to what I do and what I am in school. 

I do want to do well. I understand the drive to do well academically, and it's what I expect of myself as well. But I can't always put my finger on what it is that makes me so mad. 

To OP, hang in there. I can't promise it'll get better, but as so many others have said, treasure the people around you, your friends, find a CCA you enjoy, things you like to do, slow down a bit when you can, and if you can't find time, make time. It's the little things that make life :-)

2lgoo8,clus3iq,"Hi, I think most of us can empathise. It's a pretty stressful environment here in Singapore. Plenty of amazing comments above. To be plenty honest, i think things have been getting worse as time goes by. More and more people are aiming for the standard sg dream: get a degree, get a house, get a car. Our exams are insane (iirc a few years back UK wanted us to lower our standards cos our GCE As were too advanced compared to theirs). 

I graduated JC in 2011 and it was already a pretty hell then. Now i see my juniors and they seem more caught up with supplementaries and school programmes. It is probably all about prioritising. My secondary and JC days were the best of my life so far. I enjoyed my CCA, i made good friends, we screwed around alot. For my school's standard i was mediocre. In sec 1 and 2 i felt bad, but by sec 3 i was owning it. Yup i suck, deal with it. I'm thinking you're in an IP school since no Os, so my advice is cruise where you can. Don't burn out. I buckled down in J2 because As were approaching and I did ok. I'm now doing my undergrad degree so that turned out fine. Another time to chill would be army, probably a different kind of working hard, but definitely a break from studying. My friends all seemed to enjoy it. I had fun until i disrupted, and now still wondering if it was worth it haha. 

Day to day living may seem tough, but have your goals and just work on prioritising again. Not everything is necessary (homework lol. Never did 80% of those). Give yourself a break. I would say choose a CCA you enjoy because then that would be a break at the same time (singaporean efficiency). If not, set aside time everyday to chill or enjoy your hobby.

2lgoo8,cluy2z9,"As someone who has been two both sides, I was from normal academic stream and I went to a neighborhood secondary school and I was failing my classes. Those time was fun but filled with regrets after my express friends went on with life and I was still stuck in the school. 

Eventually I made it to polytechnic, worked really hard there and now i am doing my masters in the states with full scholarship since undergraduate. 

But during my journey to where I am, I have experienced the same thing you have mentioned. I didn't have time for myself and so much competition and the amount of stress is crazy. 

I think the key is to pace yourself and force yourself to relax. When you feel really stressed up, it's time to chill. It sounds counter intuitive but it's true. Normally you are stressed up because you think there's no time or whatsoever, but the point is you always have time to chill, it's whether you can let yourself go and just relax and recharge then get back to it. 

No one can go on and on forever without burning out. Think about this, you won't fail your subject if you take a day off or two (if you did your work consistently)

Another point is try to have fun whenever and whatever you are doing, like studying in group, build friendship and help each other out! Hang out with your peers and etc! It's all about the balance or how you sneak them in.

Lastly, I feel that working hard is better than just have fun and not making good use of your time(subjective). Regret is the worst thing you can experience, and why it suck is because you can never go back and change it. Trust me on that. 

tldr - Pace yourself to work hard and have fun, it's all about the balance. Do what you value the most, and have no regret! ",1,grandstream,2014-11-07 11:09:03,2lgoo8

If all else fails, treat what you're doing as a challenge instead of a task. If it's too simple, then find something you're not good at and get better in it. 

Happiness is overrated (not to mention that it only exists now). Meaning, on the other hand, is forever. Learn to see the unseen lessons in what you do. There is always a silver lining, kinda? 

Even a highly stressful environment is good in a way. Stressed out at school and can't cope? It doesn't matter you can still catch up along the way. If it's smooth sailing and you never learn how to cope with stress, imagine what happens if you learn that lesson doing things that matter (in your career, maybe).

I wouldn't say PSLE was stressful, but I suppose for some people who have high expectations placed upon themselves (also by others) may feel the strain.... 

I feel at secondary level, the textbook is your ultimate friend in studying. Once you fully grasp the basics and do a few questions under the teacher's guidance, the rest will slowly come to you. If you have questions, write them down or make notes of them. That's when tuition teachers come in handy. To answer things you weren't able to figure out and help you with extra practice. Sadly, I only realized this in Sec4. Wasted a lot of time in tuition before I decided to just start studying myself in JC. 

How do you spend the time during your tuition and consultations, OP? :O

In China, the competition is just insane, you see how people here complain about PRC scholars outdoing everyone? These are the people who are good but not great in China... 

Anyway, I'll like to share that school life is THE most stressful time of your life. 20-40 is super fucking easy, no one tells you what to do and how. Everyday I play civ 5 and LoL and roll in what my teenage self would consider a bed of cash (but actually average pay la haha). I live alone in a rented hdb with as many pets as I want, and I DONT MOP THE FLOOR REGULARLY NO ONE NAGS. 

The SG education system is actually quite good in terms of managing stress, it sounds like your stress comes more from family and yourself. 

I'll share an anecdote that you may find very odd. I was a student in RJ, everyone outside RJ thinks the place is highly super stressed and competitive. The people who joined RJ from outside the RI/RGS system also felt the same, and were constantly stressed out. But the vast majority of the Raffles people were incredibly chill and couldn't be bothered with competing. It's simply because they have learnt to manage their expectations. We know there are the supermen out there, no point fighting them, just do the best we can and have a happy life. The people who came from outside RI they were used to being number 1 in their schools and hadnt encountered the unbeatable supermen and were stressed over how to continue being number 1. 

So the moral of the story is, manage your expectations if you want to be happy. Unless of course you want to be superman then go ahead and fight hard. And remember, school days are considered the best from pure nostalagia. Days of a working adult are objectively more fun and have a lot more freedom. ",1,tjhan,2014-11-07 18:09:14,2lgoo8

2lgoo8,clvpuw1,"as a sec 4 IP student let me give you some perspective. I have gotten rid of my year end exams and Chinese Os and am now doing self reflection at the airport, so this would be a perfect opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you.

""First of all, schooling itself is already a big competition...""

Yes it is, and it is only right that it is that way. A school is a subset of society and so competition is to be expected. The key is how do you manage this presence of competition and not allow it to take over your life. 

""...stereotype about 'neighbourhood schools from the society...'

Honestly I believe those stereotypes are ever so slowly decreasing. It is slow and very subtle but it is happening. I volunteer with an organisation with heavy presence of polytechnic students, ITE students, students from 'neighbourhood' schools. Being an IP ""elite"" student myself, the most valuable friendships that I have made, asides from those within my class and a few within my cohort, are the ones that I have forged with so called 'neighbourhood school' people. being in an elite school everybody is alike. Everybody wants to get the public service commission, go to imperial college london to study medicine, come back and work as a medical researcher earning 200 grand a year (That in itself is a scholarship but it does hold some truth in my opinion). People come from relatively similar family background, have similar goals like I have mentioned, do things similarly etc. I will be frank and say that it is BORING and downright RIDICULOUS. Being in an elite school we are supposed to be leaders, but how are you going to be a leader when everybody around you is the SAME? When you are a leader you lead people from all walks of life, and to be able to do so you have to meet them. I know of, and maintain good friendships with people who are from single parent families, people perceived as 'paikia'/ahlian/ahbeng etc, and it honestly has helped me gain a better perception of society. It has allowed me to empathise with people who may not have been as fortunate as me, to understand them and to help them in any way that I can. So to sum up, I call that stupid stereotype of neighbourhood schools bullshit. Neighbourhood schools are interesting. Yes there are a couple of bad sheep who cannot be corrected, but neighbourhood school students are amongst some of the most wonderful people that I have met. Don't fall into believing that stereotype. It destroys you in the end, and you get a horrendous culture shock when you graduate and move on to society.

""...we spend at least 6-7 hours in school per day. And then we start to add up co-curricular activities, one could easily be spending 11-12 hours in school, twice or thrice a week...""

I say that if you cannot change those circumstances, maybe you can change the way you look at it. I went through a major change in sec 2, when I was dragging a huge pile of baggage (I.e. disciplinary records) about, a not very nice GPA and conduct grade etc. I decided that since there was no way I could just stop schooling and drop out then I might as well change the way that I perceive schooling. I take triple science and I try my best to enjoy each and every subject that I take. Now this may strike you as that ""nerd"" or ""mugger"" stereotype but in the long run it will help you a LOT. Lessons suddenly become much more interesting, when you pay attention to the material being taught, think beyond it, try to make connections between the subjects etc. And to go above and beyond the syllabus, to figure out new things etc etc. It makes those 6-7 hours much, much more bearable, when you try to get yourself interested in the stuff. Case in mind when I hated biology, but I had to take biology as I chose triple science. So I decided to enjoy biology lessons as much as possible. Loooking at wikipedia, doing self research etc. Somehow I find biology really interesting. I chose my JC combi a few weeks ago. I dropped physics for biology.

'...will then be faced with piles of homework which are expected to be done in a short span of time...'

that, unfortunately, yes, affects me a lot as well, and I honestly do not have good advice on that, because I despise homework as well. However I do make the effort o complete things as soon as possible. it is much less stressful and i get to laugh at my friends who are rushing work last minute (no I dont actually do that I am nice). And being interested in the material will help as well.

'...all these things has really been taking its toll on me...'

yes me too. I will be frank with you and say that even though I have put in so much effort to make my school life bearable, this year has been a hectic, crazy, stressful year, now that I am done with my exams I swear I have NEVER been SO bored in the entire year. It is just so weird waking up and having nothing to do. You are not alone, I empathise with you, but I think lessening the stress is something that is possible.

'...lacking time to relax...'

You do have time to relax. Trust me. And if you do  not have time, make time. I am not saying neglect your studies, but do yolo a bit. I will be frank with you and say that I think that at times, homework is not the most important thing.

If you are really too stressed out you can talk to my teacher. My school does a really great job with this as all the teachers have really good relationships with each other and the students, so we are able to manage the homework deadlines and project deadling coordination such that we don't have 21398734593 things due at the same time. Don't worry - if you are stressed out your friends likely are too, so you will have backing. And as long as you make it known in a polite and impartial manner, even if you do not get what you want the teacher will surely have an increased level of respect for you.

'...to get a life, chat with friends, meet up and hang out...'

Make time. sec sch is stressful YES. time for relaxation is little YES. So make the most of what you have, make your days as productive as possible. I like to head down to the study centre opposite my house because for some reason I am ultra productive there. I can't study at home because there are a huge amount of distractions so I don't study at home. Find what works best for you, find ways of doing more things in less time. Productivity is key, not just in school, but when you go into the workforce as well. 

when you get the itme, which I am sure you will at least have SOME time, go do meaninfgul stuff. I spend my time volunteering as a photographer or for ad-hoc events. The charity org in which I volunteer for is the most amazing organisation that I have been part of. It has allowed me to meet many people (see above) and what I have learnt there far surpasses what I have learnt in school - as a team leader of a group of ushers you learn people skills, working on frontline, communication etc etc etc. really valuable skills which dare I say are even more important than grades. Because as a component of society you are expected to interact with society, and you need to be able to deal with people to be able to do as such. You may know the action mechanism behind various biological processes, the exact makeup of the atomic nucleus etc, but those are irrelevant in real life, when you have to survive. Also get a hobby, interest etc - I am a bus enthusiast and I am proud of it, people call me weird but I don't give a shit, I know I have more life than them because they dont even have soemthing to do in their leisure time. It helps to make living life more meaningful and less mundane.

To sum up, live life. don't be a no life. Otherwise life is pointless. I know i sound retarded but it is true. 

If that emotional stress is really taking its toll on your mental health, there is always your teachers. If your teachers dont want to help, there are parents, psychologists, friends etc... people who will be there for you when you need them. Remember, you may be feeling stressed, but the people around you are feeling it too... you are never alone.

'....how can i face it when i grow up...'

I think what I have said in the previous sections sum it all up: Do what you love, don't be too materialistic. Aim high and relish competition but do not let number one treasure your life. As long as you can find a balance you will be fine. I am unable to give more appropriate advice because I am still 16, but I think several other posters here have good pointers which you can learn a lot from. 

I say although life is tough, but life is short so live it well!

""...that life lost its meaning for me...""

end of years is approaching right? During your holidays when you are free, I urge you do do something like what I'm doing now. Just pour out all your thoughts, whatever thing that you might be thinking of. I do this yearly, at changi airport, as it is a quiet place and very close knitted to me as an aviation enthusiast (asides from buses I am interested in civil aviation as well). Reflect on what you've accomplished, set clear goals for next year and how you are going to work towards them. Even if you do not achieve them you have tried. I had a set of goals for this year which I achieved only about half, but I am perfectly satisfied and I do not regret one single moment because I know I have tried, and in the process of achieving those goals I have learnt a lot as well. I will be doing up my stuff for next year too - it helps a lot trust me. Set a long term dream for yourself, and intermediate steps that you are going to take to achieve said dream. It doesn't have to be academic related (get A for science get PhD in this subject etc). My ultimate dream is to travel all 6 continents by car. Intermediate goals would be to expose myself to more culture (Travel!), get money (Job), experience (Interests, communication skills etc) bla bla bla. It is up to you what you think you want to achieve in your life. Don't say that life has lost its meaning. Average life expectancy in Singapore is about 80. You are 15. You have 65 years to go. Make full use of that 65 years to achieve your ultimate dream. Don't say that you do n ot think you will get to relax, enjoy, life your life. Think positive. You don't know. The point of your life is to achieve that ultimate dream that you have set for yourself. For me, if I have achieved said dream, I would consider myself success, having lived my life to capacity.



This has been an especially good session for me to voice our my rhoughts too, seeing as we are stuck in the same educaation system and will move on into the same soceity in the near future. What I say may not have been totally irrelevant because I am just saying wahtever pops into my head and I may have digressed a lot, but trust me that this is my most honest thoughts as a student. To summarise, have a dream. Make goals that will get you closer towards your dream. Life live to the fullest, because life is short. you only have so long to achieve your dream. Treasure it. 

would like to end off with a quote by Sarah Louise Delany, American civil rights activist: ""Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet.""",1,sierralab,2014-11-08 06:28:45,2lgoo8

In terms of my age though, i indeed am still in secondary school, age fifteen to be exact - i guess being sec 3 is when things starts to get tougher (stepping up in cca, longer lesson time and pressurized to start studying to do well in O level etc), being a major factor as to why i decided to write this post here.

Regarding work, just make sure you're skilled and have something to offer to society. Things will tend to sort itself out when the time comes. I recommend this book: http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6. In regard of study, go for the hardest thing you can manage in uni. The idea is to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone.

Also, Singapore is not the whole world. Keep your mind open and don't ignore the possibility of leaving Singapore one day. It is very common for people in larger countries to move around within cities in the same country and experience a different culture etc. In Singapore, this is not possible, so travel and broaden your mind as much as possible.

Finally, fuck the tuition and CCA. Don't do them if you don't want to. In place of tuition, form a study group with your friends. If you wanna do CCA, make sure it's something you enjoy, otherwise you're wasting your time.",1,ginger_beer_m,2014-11-08 18:13:56,clunrtn
2lgoo8,clvqpy6,"There are a few observations I would make. I think this would apply wherever you go.

* Put together a draft itinerary. Work hard on where you want to go and why. Then either throw away half or double your time away. You gain far more of a feeling for a place by just hanging out than by rushing from bus to bus.
* Prefer overland transport to air. Sometimes distance means you will need to fly, but you're in an aluminium tube 9,000 meters above real life.
* Find ways to engage with locals. I bought (in Singapore) a cheap phrasebook for the 8 most common languages in Asia. I am sure that I completely mangled each of the languages in question, but it was great ice breaker. I think that at least trying to say 'please' and 'thank you' in the local language shows respect for local culture.
* All of my best experiences were about people rather than places, and were completely unplanned. Yes, Angkor Wat is awesome and Boracay is probably the most beautiful beach I have ever seen, but consider some of these: instant bonding and laughter with the with the other passengers of a Jeepney while we worked together to change a burst tyre half-way to Sagada. Sitting down with a young (I guess 12yo) postcard vendor in Siem Reap who just wanted to practice some English, and ending up eating with his family. Watching a Sumatran 'bull fight' (where the bulls don't really fight). These were among menu priceless experiences, but you can only experience them if you allow yourself some time, and don't rush everywhere.
* Take sensible care and precaution, but don't be scared of everything. Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth. Hanoi is definitely not as safe, but it's fine if you don't flash your new iPhone and money belt everywhere.
* Even if you can afford it, don't go 5*. I found the SGD10-30 guest-houses were generally clean, safe and full of people you would want to talk to (NB: those prices were over 10 years ago - budget needed probably higher now).
* This will be controversial, but travel alone. I lost count of the number of people who were travelling with Girlfriend/Boyfriend who split up when they wanted to do different things, then spent all their time moping about it. A trip of this type is really a pretty selfish thing anyway, and it works better if you just accept that you want to be able to follow your own path. Satisfying others can be very hard.
* Your itinerary *will* change. You will come to places you want to leave immediately and others where you will want to stay longer.
* (for males only) if you frequent brothels, don't expect respect from the locals. You don't deserve it, and respectable people will stay way from you.",3,jodonoghue,2014-11-08 07:01:23,clur1zd

That said, I personally didn't find my academic life stressful, competitive, nor experience any lack of time. However, I'd venture that the situation nowadays is most probably more intense than ""back then"". My reasoning is as follows: If you track the historical records for L1R4/L1R5 aggregates for the JCs/Polys, and the IGP for the university courses, they become more competitive over time. Competitiveness is naturally correlated with stress levels (which influences your perception of how much free time you have).

2fizog,ck9qor2,"I think I've written about this before on this subreddit but I don't mind repeating myself again.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's while I was one year into National Service. Prior to that diagnosis my parents and I merely assumed that I was a weird kid since my behavior was very similar to my father's, so we *were* weird but not anomalies. I wasn't severely bullied at school though.

But things were different in NS. It was due to my behavior as an Aspie which resulted in me turning into a frequent target of bullying from officers, senior NCOs, NCOs and my fellow NSFs. There was no relief from that bullying and I nearly blew my head off with my rifle. From that point onwards, I was made to seek professional help. But it wasn't as if the bullying stopped. Even though I had a detailed letter from a prolific (retired) military psychiatrist explaining my condition in simple language and wrote out recommendations on dealing with me, many of my superiors accused me of malingering.

Our state propaganda likes to boast that National Service promotes patriotism in us. I'm afraid to say that the NS experience only served to cement my antipathy for this country and steeled my resolve to leave it behind.

I can probably write an entire essay on how I cope and integrate myself into society. Obviously, being with large groups of people is a mentally draining affair for me and I work best in one-on-one discussions, or at most in a gathering of 4 people. Any more and I will just shut down and go silent. In not too many words, in order to make up for my natural lack of empathy for other people, I apply my intellectual side of my mind in imagining how it feels like to be in other person's shoes before proceeding with responses. This ""intellectual side"" is something that everyone should be familiar with - it's that mode you use when you're doing Math in your head, or when you're doing homework. My other method is to construct and employ a mental flowchart that's not very different from the Friendship Algorithm used by Big Bang Theory's Sheldon. It's not a rigid structure, however. If I make a mistake with someone and it results in a social snafu, I don't get too caught up in how badly I fucked up, take it as a lesson learned, adjust that mental flowchart of mine and move on with life. Sure, it might make my social interactions seem insincere when I describe them as a mere function of my flowchart, but this is how I integrate myself with society.",15,,2014-09-05 23:55:58,2fizog

2fizog,ck9s8ww,"Hi! I have PMDD and ADHD (now called ADD I believe). 

ADHD is actually pretty well understood/accepted compared to other illnesses. Mine is predominantly inattentive and I'm able to manage it without medication. It's definitely quite difficult to deal with but I think I'm pretty good considering that no one besides my immediate family, doctors, and a close friend know about it.

PMDD is not well understood at all, even by science I imagine. I'm still not sure if it's a mental or physical condition; probably both, since it involves hormones? I was surprised when I was diagnosed with it; everyone in my family suffers from difficult menstruation, but I'm the only one I know of who suffers mentally as well. I don't tell anyone about it because even when I explain, people just assume it's the same as PMS. It is quite different. I can control how I feel during PMS and I can identify what causes me to cry, become angry, etc. with this, I cry for days and days whenever I'm alone and even sometimes in public if it's quite bad and I don't know why I'm crying so I can't stop. Crying so much is physically tiring and after these crying episodes I have to sleep a lot to rest my body and eyes. Crying gets mixed up with anger and this is the worst because anger can be directed at others, unlike sadness, and I don't want my problems to affect anyone else. I've only gotten angry at someone else twice and even though both people said it's ok, I still feel so ashamed of myself for it. This has been happening for the past 5 years but I only got a name for it a few months ago. Unfortunately medication is out of the question as I have tried SSRIs before and they made it worse. Hormonal birth control can make the symptoms better but I have a family history of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers and I would rather not take a chance. So I just deal with it on my own. Exercising a lot (gym in the morning and running at night) helps a lot, as does talking to people I care about NOT face to face as I feel very dead, lose my appetite, unable to smile, etc the whole time this is happening. But neither of them make it go away completely.
My parents know I have it but they don't understand it either, so I stopped telling them how I feel. I've only told a few friends and most don't get it.

I don't disagree with you on that point. The way I think through it, I ""deceive"" people in my everyday life because my survival as a person in this society depends on it. That's a justifiable *casus deceptio* (case for deception) for me. It no longer becomes justified when I deceive someone just because I want their company and intimacy.

My life has had drama since then that no educationally focused Singaporean parent would have accepted, so I was not informed of my diagnosis until I stopped going to school again a few years later.

Examples are: I have no idea what constitutes mock outrage from others; I just think about how they're totally right and not how they are just joking. I have no filter whatsoever; I can say things that hurt others without meaning to in the first place. (I am not the best person, but I don't like telling others things that hurt them. I then adjust my framework of how to converse, but not before I feel terrible inside.) 

A big thing is that my speech is very uneven. It's difficult for me to compose a full statement in my mind and I often end up clarifying my views as I go along and denouncing the stands that I might have held in the previous sentence. I have no idea how to get out of an awkward situation. I stay there and get manipulated or just shut down and reject any further communication.

I feel like I can switch between analysing the situation I'm in, like at a group outing or at the market, and responding emotionally and sort of living in the now.

2fizog,ckaoe6t,"> my survival as a person in this society depends on ('deceiving' people)
Many other people also have to 'deceive' others to survive in society. Criminals on the run from the law, rich people who want companions who see them as themselves, disfigured people who undergo plastic surgery (or simply people who wear makeup), queer people pressured to seem normative, and people with emotional trauma that they want to move on from but can never forget. 

Maybe such examples don't convince you that 'deception' is ok in certain situations. I know I can do much better in arguing my case and these examples may suck, but I'm sure that there would be an example, an exception to your rule that you can accept as a legitimate 'deception'.

> 'I've been deceived before for superficial reasons and it's terrible'
> '(deceiving) someone just because I want their company and intimacy (is not justifiable)'

You may have Aspergers, but you still have social needs, and you deserve to have your needs fulfilled just like you are entitled to human rights. This is not a superficial need. And this goes beyond interaction with others; the ASMR from a soothing conversation and the fulfilment of the need for intimate skin-to-skin contact are nice things that everyone should ideally get to experience on a regular basis. 

The latter is particularly important. Hug machines and no-strings-attached cuddle partners could be options to consider. Some may also let their false front down during cuddling to their cuddle partners. If the relationship progresses in such a situation, would there still be 'deception' in your opinion? Maybe this is a possibility of how one could grow a relationship with someone else without 'deception' - skip to the physical intimacy and let things go from there. Both of them would know something is up for the other to seek cuddling partners, so they won't be so surprised if the reason comes up.

If you are not convinced that 'deception' is not deception but a legitimate survival technique (well you do think it is a survival technique) and you don't think that there can be a natural way to shed the 'deception', maybe you could change your standards for a good relationship. Not everyone is looking for a relationship built on trust, communication and openness. Successful relationships that don't successfully incorporate all these components exist. 

This may not even be romantic; many people are just looking for friends that have their back. It doesn't really matter whether you are 'real' to them - you always got their back, and in return they have yours. That would be as real as friendships get. Then you can reveal your 'deception'. (like how gay people come out) Then maybe friends could be become something more.

I'm sorry if I failed to convince you. I am young and inexperienced at this. You could receive better advice that would convince you from someone else. Perhaps that may at least let you acknowledge that your stand is not immutable.",1,pannerin,2014-09-07 03:00:46,ckanh8z

2fizog,ckbfe4e,"Yeah, most people I meet. Different people have different personalities, and though people who seem like perfect matches to me have been really rare, I enjoy identifying with the things I have in common with people I know. There's a bro, a flamer, a nerd, a baby snark, an art school kid, a beng in me - I just bring out the sides of me I have in common with the people I'm with, enjoy letting those sides hang out and mix with the sides others choose to bring out then. 

There are a lot of chill people, manic pixie dream girls and just generally positive and accepting people around. Even the cynical and negative people are tempered with snark. I just try to enjoy what is around me.

But I always worry I seem too easygoing with others and have no real substance with others. I prefer to observe like an involved voyeur into teenage anthropology, and I think I seem aloof because of that. 

Because I am a very liberal person people do seek my advice and they do seem comforted by what I have to say. But the statistics on acceptance of homosexuality locally convinces me to remain closeted to everyone I know. As a result of hiding an important aspect of my life to others I don't feel close to anyone. I feel bad when I think people seem to think they are really good friends with them, because I don't feel the same. And with Christians and Muslims I always feel fearful and threatened in the back of my head due to their commonly held beliefs, so that's not really conducive for making friends!

And I am a perfectionist with terrible study habits, so I give up easily on my studies.

&nbsp;

Prime target for bullying here. Had a temper and probably the strength to beat the shit out of them but relented bc of ""If you hit them you are the one in the wrong"" bullshit argument by teachers and counsellors. Was fat in primary and secondary school and had somewhat low EQ at that time. Name was made fun of and was a classic for them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Primary:**


Got teased for being fat and being in TAF club. Goaded into getting angry because of the tantrums I threw to vent out anger and avoid beating them. Threw tables and chairs. Meet a piece of shit in P6 class who we will refer to as POS who started a fucking crusade of bullying against me. He is the one who started the idea of making fun of my name. Teachers did nothing aside from telling me to ignore them and telling them off.

&nbsp;

Highlights:


* Caused a tantrum after a bad session of teasing in the canteen after one remedial lesson causing from what I heard a few parents to run off with their children scared.


* Got tormented with name calling down a spiral staircase when I pleaded with them to stop and that I just wanted to go home.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Secondary School:**


Turns out POS and many of the classmates I knew went to the same sec school due to affiliation. Bullying escalated to putting staples on my chair, leaving notes and further harassment during recess. Broke lots of tables and chairs in my anger to vent. Spent most of recess time alone or with the few allies I had. In Lower Sec I had this group who teamed up to bully me. Teachers and prefects did jack shit, not even parents calling helped. What's more some of these guys (including POS) are considered star students due to grades/CCA. 

&nbsp;

**Highlights (Lower sec):**


* Grandfather died in Lower Sec. Broke down during a bullying session the day after. Bullies stopped for a while but resumed.

&nbsp;

* Bullies turned a transfer student against me.

&nbsp;

**Upper Sec:**


* POS was in my class in Upper Sec. The crusade continues.

&nbsp;

* Found new and innovative excuse and ways to trigger me. Eg, If I used my pen or compass in a certain manner they would make fun of that. One time we found poo in the dustbin. I had nothing to do with that at all but they decided to connect it to me and make fun of me with that. Etc. 

&nbsp;

* Started a false rumor that I was gay.

&nbsp;

* Found out where I lived and harassed me at my home, the one place I felt relaxed.

&nbsp;

* Snapped at one point and nearly killed one of them with something sharp. Was pried away by a few other classmates who btw, did jack shit to stop them harassing me but did all they could to stop me from killing one of them.

&nbsp;

* Accidentally threw a chair in blind rage at one of my few friends during one of their sessions. Got pulled aside by math teacher afterwards, who consoled me. Revealed that moment where I threw the chair reminded her of why...someone she knew very well got hospitalized and was in tears telling this to me. I vowed to never do something like that again for her sake. Friend forgave me fortunately and just told me to work on my aim. Apologized to the class for this. Bullies didn't care.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tons of other shit and details I can't remember either bc repressed them or plain forgot.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

No more bullying in Poly, bc we all went seperate ways. Lost weight. Calmed down, learnt to control temper. BUT was left with low self-esteem/confidence, was seen by peers as defensive(from what I hear) and interacting with people was awkward. Took me a while (throughout poly) to try and fix that. Still WIP. Small social network after poly due to not being social enough.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

From what I hear the bullies appear to be doing well, in good Uni, some have GF, all have good social circle and tightly knit close friends. Good for them. But fuck them. Fuck them for being able to enjoy their life while I am stuck alone dealing with the consequences of what they did to me. In hindsight I should have maybe punched them hard. Maybe that would have stopped them. Sure I would be suspended or worse. But personally that's better than the hellhole that is my Sec School life. I wonder if all this could have been avoided if I did that. Did I deserve all of what I went through, I don't know. I was immature back then but I never caused any trouble whatsoever, but if there was a reason, they should have just told me outright instead. Fuck bullies.

&nbsp;

TLDR: Was a prime target for bullying in Pri and Sec school. 'Organized group' formed to target me. Diminished social skills as a result. Doing somewhat well now but regrets not striking at them when I should have.

7mk5ft,druqwo6,"I was bullied in Primary School... by my own damn teacher. Long story below.

Call it tough love, but the way she handled the 'weaker' students in her class still riles me up, so much so that if I could see her today, I'd punch her. She was a tyrannical matriach and while she praised the smarter students, the ones who fell behind were outright called 'idiots' by her. I shit you not, she called us idiots. And when the rest of the class began calling us idiots as well, she just sat there and smiled. The fuck. 

Hell, I remember one time we were doing some math shit on our personal little whiteboards, and we had to write down our train of 'workings' to show how we got to the answer. I had a Math tutor back then who taught me an efficient way of solving that particular equation, which involved skipping a few 'working' steps, and I thought it was so brilliant, I chose to do it his way.

She took one look at my answer, smiled, then accused me of copying another student's work because I was usually the weakest math student, and flatly asked me if 'I thought I was so smart'.

Oho, I'm not even done yet. There was also one incident where she was giving out our textbooks that she kept for us. When it came down to one textbook, there was no name, and two students were still without anything- me and another boy. I was dead on sure it was my book, even though I forgot to paste my name on there, because of the plastic cover with a tear on it. The other boy thought it was his, too, but remembered his doesn't have a cover and told the teacher it was mine.

The teacher didn't believe him and tried to give it to him anyway, and when I loudly insisted it was mine, she relented, all the while telling me that 'God will strike down liars with lightning'. Lady, fuck off.

TL;DR bad primary school teacher.

Edit: I remembered another story! Though it's a lot more pettier than the others. Again, it involved the whiteboards and our working steps. So this time, me and a couple others didn't get the answer right, and she responded by *throwing* the whiteboards. One girl before me, her whiteboard hit the wall and *shattered*. Teacher didn't do anything about it, and the poor girl had to pick up the biggest piece of the remains and continue with her work. Bitch teacher threw mine too, but I got lucky and it kinda slid into the area between the blackboard and the wall.

I'd like to think she's the reason why I hate maths.

i saw this one guy get pinned down onto a bed by a bunch of seniors/juniors and some really alpha senior straddled him and pulled down his pants. then he held his penis by the foreskin and stretched it upwards as far as it could go, and started flicking his dick with his finger while everyone laughed at him. after a few minutes of that he sprayed deodorant on his dick and let him go. that happened to me too, except i got straddled by a less alpha senior so he didn't pull down my pants or touch my dick - he just sprayed dedorant down my underwear.

it was really common for people to get ""popcorn"" on their birthdays. basically, you wake them up at midnight and wish them happy birthday before throwing a blanket over them, turning out the lights and beating the crap out of them. one of my friends was rolled up in the blanket and got thrown onto the lower bunk of a bunk bed. then the seniors took turns running towards the bed, jumping and grabbing onto the railing beside the top bunk to swing towards him and kick him. looked like it hurt pretty bad. luckily my birthday was after the seniors graduated so nothing really happened to me.

this one time, a P6 kid got beaten up this way by people our room (not on his bday though) and he got really pissed off about it and complained to the warden. the warden then showed up and asked us wtf was happening and the kid narrated everything that happened to him. but as he did so the people in my room started poking holes in his story and calling out some really minor inconsistencies (e.g. kid said ""i got beat up by the seniors"" but we usually only refer to sec 4 and above as seniors, and there was only one sec 4 student in the room. everyone else who beat him up was below sec 4) and arguing with him until eventually the warden was convinced that the P6 kid was just lying. so he told the kid to shut up and go to sleep.

this one time i was spreading butter on bread for breakfast, since that was what we were served. i woke up pretty late so i had to use up the last of the butter. some ultra alpha senior came up to me and asked me if there was any butter left and i said no. so he asked me to give him my bread, and i refused. he smiled and kept asking me repeatedly if i was sure. eventually he said ""alright, whatever"" and started walking away. as he walked past me he slapped my hand and my bread fell onto the floor buttered-side down. that was a very heartbreaking moment for me

idk if this is actually bullying, but it was kinda funny. i was playing ludo with 3 other people. one of them was this ultra-religious dude who knew i was atheist and disliked me for it. he would pray to a picture of a goddess in his wallet before every roll, and whine when i rolled a 6 about how i didn't ""deserve"" my luck or something. at one point i rolled a six, followed by four more 6's (we had a rule that let you roll again if you rolled a 6). every time i rolled a six he would get increasingly more angry at me. after my fifth six he snapped and started raging at me for being atheist. he then stood up, kicked the board over and stormed out of the room. the rest of us stared at each other for a moment and started laughing. this is the same dude who took a piss in the sink in the living room at midnight with a friend because he was too scared of the dark to go to the bathroom. to be fair, the place was quite literally pitch black at night and we didn't have phones to light up the way.

we also had a lot of the usual stuff like stealing random stationery, breaking into cupboards/table drawers to steal stuff or read your diaries so they can make fun of you etc, throwing slippers into toilets, pretending to have hidden things you've lost so they can make you do stuff in exchange for getting it back, seniors treating juniors like maids and asking them to wash their clothes etc etc. this is getting kinda long though so i won't include that stuff.

i left the hostel after my first year and moved into an apartment. the head boy of our school was in my school bus and would constantly ask me for my phone to listen to music, even though he had a really nice phone of his own. at first i obliged because he would only listen to a couple of songs but eventually he started hogging it and would basically listen to my phone the entire ride. one day i said ""sorry, i want to listen to some music"" when he asked me for my phone. he tried to convince me otherwise but i wasn't listening so he got mad and started insulting me. then he shut up for a few minutes and i thought i was in the clear. all of a sudden he grabs my phone and my earphones fly out of my ears. he opens the window of the bus and holds my phone out the window, threatening to toss it out if i didn't agree to let him listen to my music. i got really mad, stood up and started screaming at him and then his massive friend grabbed me by the hair to push me back down. eventually the bus aunty (not sure if that's what you guys call her) came over to try and calm us down. the guy holding my phone started talking to her in our native language (which i can barely speak, but i can understand a bit) and tried to convince her that the phone was actually his and that i was trying to steal it from him. i guess he thought i couldn't understand him. i tried to convince her otherwise with my awful mother tongue skills and i think she eventually figured out that the phone was mine. he didn't give it back until the driver stopped the bus and came over to separate us. that was honestly really weird - he was rather nice to me until that moment. oh and literally nothing happened to him afterwards, he graduated without an issue.

oh yeah, i just remembered the student care i went to in primary school (in sg). these two retards tried to roleplay changi prison and would make us kneel down in front of tables while they pulled our shorts down and caned us. they also tried to make us fight each other and poured tea on my shorts while i was eating. fucking weird.",18,denver00,2017-12-28 21:48:51,7mk5ft
7mk5ft,drurful,"Hmm I've always prided myself on being able to stand up for myself. But hilariously, upon some self reflection, I guess I was bullied in army. I won't state what vocation I was in, but essentially there was a guy who would take the lead in doing the marching songs. He decided to pick on me, by deciding that I was the 'burden', for whatever reason. So he'd basically be singing, ""<my name> <vocation>'s burden"", over and over again. I brushed it off at first, but it got annoying after a while. 

It finally stopped after I confronted him. This happened when we were marching back from the cookhouse to the bunk, and the moment we fell out from marching formation, I ripped off my helmet, flung it to the ground and walked up to him. It was all one fluid motion, with me lifting him up by the collar and basically telling him to fuck off. The rest of the platoon was stunned, because in all honesty, I was always the type that was pretty chill.

He backed off after that. If I were to analyse his actions, I'd say that he was just trying to fit in and the easiest way was to pick on the unassuming guy. That was a couple years ago.

I guess it's his loss, because I'm now in a position where connections matter the most & I'm very much more well off than him. Both financially and network wise. ",14,xanhuilik,2017-12-28 23:11:21,7mk5ft

During primary 3 sports day, I was the second last person on my team and prior to me, we were second place. After the stuff, we were one of the last classes. My whole team got really angry with me (like physically pushed and threaten, scold me etc.) and blamed me for whole thing. 

Ever since that moment, I have a phobia to play or even exercise around other people. It has since been over a decade but writing this event now still brings tears to my eyes. 

Even now, I just feel really inadequate and incapable and always skipped PE (with any reason possible) for the rest of my school life because I felt like I would destroy the team efforts anyways. People always hated that I was a slacker or whatever but in fact, I was very frightened by just going to PE or thought of it. 

Even now, I would go to the gym at really weird timings like mid early afternoon or late at night to avoid people in the gym so that I can run alone in the place. 

To many people, it's a such a crazy small incident but it was really traumatic to me.  I know it's over and stupid but I'm still trying to get over with it .. step by step.

7mk5ft,druod3p,"I got bullied throughout my school life, sucks. So here's the chronicles of my experience being bullied.

Primary school:

1. First day of school (P1), trolley bag got kicked by one of my classmates. I retaliated, teacher saw and informed my parents. Forgot what happened to the aggressor, but when I was in P3 I no longer had to interact with him as he bragged about his feats (about maplestory, gang, basketball, etc.) regularly.

2. Tripped on some wire in the classroom, mother tongue classmate mocked me over my carelessness.

3. P3, got bullied by some P6 dude over a basketball, he snatched my basketball so I went to over to ask for it back. He refused, and began to beat me up while the rest of his basketball gang watched. He even smashed the basketball by my torso. Another even shouted at me asking me to go home to my mother, blah blah blah.

4. Played a little game and I scored. Some guy from the opposing team got triggered and smashed my face into the plastic noticeboard pane. Nose bled.

5. P4, some classmate was salty over a football game so he threw rubber bits at me. Small issue, though.

Secondary school:
Some guy (which became my classmate in Sec 3) kept bullying me. In Sec 1 Conversational Malay lessons, he kept throwing stuff at me, teacher did minimal intervention. When we became classmates, things got worse in Sec 4. He was jealous of my effeciency, he started calling me names (which most of the class would subsequently use). His clique (which were also in my class) also called my stuff like fatass and pulled tricks on me. Glad I don't see any of them now.

JC:
Classmate claimed I was gay and began to spread rumors about it. Thing escalated when I scolded for him to shut up when he interrupted one of my conversations in purpose. As fate would have it again, he was in my PW group but we buried the hatchet and bonded because of PW.

One thing I would regret having throughout is the schools' and MOE's silence on their stance of bullying and the failure of witnesses to report said incidents. I will not forget (I do know the identity of the P6 bully) those who treated me as such and refused to even offer the olive branch.

On a side note: I bulied some newcomer in a childcare before and kicked him. The teachers found out and I got destroyed, wrote a written letter depicting the indicent (I hid the letter, should have thrown it out) and got banned from any activities until my behaviour improved.",18,StrongMadness,2017-12-28 21:35:28,7mk5ft

Another incident of my Sec 1 classmate who hanged himself due to bullying. hes indian and love indian dance. he got bullied by several bullies who called him names hence he hanged himself in his one room flat. I wished i could help him coz at the time i can relate in a way coz i was bullied too.

One of the incidents happened during reservist a few years back. We'd just finished outfield (3 days) and I was going to wash my uniform in the toilet when I saw him washing 2 pairs of boots.

I asked him why he'd brought 2 pairs of boots outfield when he said he was helping another platoon mate to wash his. 

Needless to say I got pretty pissed off and grabbed the boots he was washing, walked back to the bunk and threw the wet boots at the guy who was lying on his bed on his phone and blew my top off at him.

one of them was a huge indian kid (he was at least 1.5x bigger than me), and the other was a chinese guy who was a big fan of gorillaz. 

i remember the time i figured out that making fun of the gorillaz guy's jaw would really get to him. it was like discovering kryptonite against superman. it was **super effective**. he had this jaw abnormality which meant the upper half was always protruding and he couldn't close his mouth properly. naturally, this meant that i would get bullied harder, but man did it feel good to know i could get to one of them. 

eventually, it must have gotten too much for him at some point and he just broke down crying after one of my occasional jabs at his jaw. 

we ended up having this mutual understanding where he would stop using me as a punching bag and i would stop poking fun at his insecurity. the indian kid never let up, though. fucking cunt.",8,nazedarou,2017-12-29 00:10:41,7mk5ft

The next day,everyone knew who I liked and the guy just stared at me in disgust and they all mocked me for 
months.

In Mandarin class,an annoying girl snatched my pen and she wouldn’t return it to me.It was a very sentimental object to me and I chased her around the class,until she flung the pen against the floor and was like.”Here,you want it?Here you go!”

It broke and I did too,had a breakdown in class.The teacher did notice and forced her to apologize and give me one of her pens as compensations.Of course she was not remorseful and gave me that bitchy look.Everyone laughed at me.


There was another girl who was in my project group and one time I didn’t listen to her nonsense,she stabbed a pen on my hand.Teacher didn’t do anything.

I hated choir.They were judgmental people who would select specific people of a certain body size(big) to pick on,including the conductor.I was told I couldn’t do anything and spread a false rumour that I bought porn home from the Hong Kong excursion,humiliating me in front of everyone and was told I was ‘blur and fucking stupid and retarded.’

Tried to quit but the teacher in charge and my mom wouldn’t let me.

When I was in an overseas school excursion trip,someone told me who had planned this bullying and humiliation-it was a girl who I thought was nice and wouldn’t do this to me.

That girl has continued her ways even into Secondary school,a close source tells me.

7mk5ft,drv0x93,"More general post, bear with me.

- I think it really began in p2, after a teacher mistakenly called me out for misbehaving and made me stand in front of the entire cohort. Especially since I was publicly humiliated yet innocent, and not even my 'friends' who knew tried to correct her, I instantly devolved from a optimistic, driven and sociable kid to one withdrawn, scared and scarred who only had video games to confide in.

- from primary 3/4, my score dropped so low that I was in one of the ""bad"" classes. Being the quiet and tiny guy surrounded by delinquents, my stuff goes missing a lot. It also doesnt help that, being a middle child, I cherish everything my parents gave me more than most kids do, and react more emotionally when they get stolen. I remember leaving my bag in the parade square and hiding to catch the bullies red-handed. I did and, of course, confronting them only meant I got beat up. The teachers ofc did nothing about it - they cant be arsed to. I dont even remember how most of my bullying went, except it was prolonged, largely physical, and deleted from my memory. (I think there were some bleeding-in-the-head and punch-in-the-gut occasions too)

Im not sure if I really got over it. I dont really think about it anymore, but when I do, it does open up some scars. And no doubt it factors into who I am now. I am technically doing well, but I am in an ongoing battle with depression, anxiety and self loathing. Funny thing, my chinese teacher in p6 called my parents and advised them to have me checked for mental disorders, and they did nothing! The school had a program to help struggling children with mental disorders, but I wasnt ""severe enough"" and nobody bothered to follow up. Probably my parents were too afraid of the truth and swept it under the carpet.

Please, if your kids or friends are going though bullying, or any kind of emotional ordeal, BE THERE FOR THEM. Having someone by your side will save lives. Conversely, I never confide in my parents for anything, and thats a wonderful family relationship innit!?",4,kakefumi,2017-12-29 05:52:27,7mk5ft

My self esteem was hit pretty hard I guess. I wasn't very talkative as a kid to begin with, and I just avoided talking at all if I could after secondary school. I still have trouble socialising. And I come off as being defensive most of the time.

-Kicked my ankles when walking down the stairs

-I remember there was this incident where a big and burly guy who was very fierce and mean was causing trouble. One day, I think he was chasing after me, (Don't rmb much), so i left my bag in the classroom and went to the principal's office to report it. Think I have PTSD or something.

He had shown much disdain for me, as I was a quiet and goody student. Also, another student spilled water on my table deliberately.

-think it was primary school? Some students thought I was blind and teased me about it.""U blind ah?"" So I acted blind. Eventually, they found out.

-The girls in my primary school spread rumours that I was siao and needed to take psychiatric medication.
Sec school:
-A bucket of water poured over me in sec sch, but I laughed it off. Amazingly, only my face got wet

-Someone who was interested in me hit me on the arm with a flexible curve

-A boy in sec school who would make the spitting sound whenever he walked past me

-Some classmate who I bantered with called me a retard on facebook

-Sitting far behind me, leaving a wide berth between me and other students during assembly

-Some girls from the NT stream, kicked my ankles and when my ear piercing got infected, teased me about it
-Some boys teasing me and calling me their wife and asking me to pole-dance or whatever shit(strangely, I actually liked it.)

That's why my anxiety is so bad, thinking about whether people liked me or not.

Poly: 
-Some girls walked past me, said: ""Hi retard"", laughed and walked off. I was feeling dissociated from reality, so I couldn't process it properly.

-There was this guy, whom I was working with on several group projects. I did not mark him down for the other group projects we were working on, though he did not contribute much. He marked me down on an IT module, and I wasn't good at it then. 

-A girl who laughed when I was doing an impromptu speech for a class. She got D for the particular impromptu speech. She also teased me about me smiling to myself. I was in love then.

Because of my appearance I was a easy target. This has caused major self esteem issues which thankfully got better in the recent years (Maybe because I slowly dgaf)

Primary school: Because I was quiet, one of the bully told other classmates to not talk to me because I was trying to be a goody two shoe to the teacher (Wtf really). 

Was pushed down the stairs but lucky not injured, and this bully liked to fold my worksheets in an ugly way when passing back to me (A big deal for me back then LOL). 

Secondary school: Helped to stand up against someone who was bullied, confided in my form teacher about it. Someone heard me doing so, and began personal attack on me. They went to my blog (blogspot was popz back then), and started leaving hate comments for me. 

According to my other classmates, there was even a chat group open to speak nasty things about me. One of the classmate even printed out one of the blog post which I wrote about some bad things on one of the bullies and then showed it to the class, trying to make me a bully.

Some malay kid always talk shit about me behind my back and put junk in my bag. I kinda ignored it because it was stupid and rather funny cuz I didnt give a shit and he tried so hard. One day, I went for recess and this NI🅱️🅱️A jacked my country erasers. I was fucking pissed and you know how I found out? He took them out and played with them with some other kid.

Fast forward a few days later he pulled the same shit again. I got really fuckin pissed this time and hatched my plan. A day later he brought his pokemon guidebook (the emerald version one) and showed off in class. Come recess I jacked his guidebook and hid it behind the metal lockers. After recess he looked for it, panicked cuz its missing and told the teach. 

Everyone was subjected to bag check and they eventually found it at the back of the class LOL. Kid was all normal after a day or two. Didnt steal shit from me until the next week.

Kimak this boy steal my neopet erasers this time. I gave up and told the teacher. Dumb kid didnt even try to hide evidence and during bag check she found it in his pencil case. It was returned but i needed to take more revenge.

Kid showed off his shiny registeel star pokayman card in class one day. Everyone was sooooo amazed because its really darn rare so smart me knew what to do. Same routine, went to class during recess, searches his bag for the card, jacked it and place it behind the removable 'display' of my SPI bag. 

No one suspected me because the teach never searched my bag properly and thoroughly and didnt find it. The kid probably knew I jacked his card but he couldnt do shit cuz I left no evidence. He cried for the whole day and never stole my stuff ever again.

Sec school: 

Sec one and two our class was really tight like even the teachers and us were just like our families kinda tight because we spent 2 years with the same people.

Sec 3 it started. This really pretty girl in the class started dating each and every single guy in the class except 5 guys because we apparently didnt make the 'cut' and I was the next in line as I wasnt as creepy as the other dudes. As someone good with females, I learnt through the grapevine that apparently some chicks think im gay and weird after a particularly animated conversation with that chio bu and some of her bitchy friends.

I was really hurted in my self esteem back then because I keep hearing hurtful things from those bitches. One day, I got to know one of the bitches and she got me to the point where she led me on and took advantage of my kindness only to freaking ghost me one day leaving me with more questions than answers. Total cold treatment.

Then she disappeared from school. I tried contacting her to ask if shes okay but nothing. And then people started linking 1 and 2 together which made me a 'rapist' for the rest of the school year. Even the sec 5 kids laughed and made fun of me when they saw me :'/ 

Sad times man. But when sec 4 came, we started hanging out in smaller more tight groups. I eventually became really close friends with that pretty gurl and another one of her non bitch female friend. Heard the whole story, got some closure and the apology I really needed and moved on. O levels came, we studied together, did stupid shit in CLB and graduated sec school.

Few years down the road, chiobu's friend ghosted me because she had a crush on me and I got a gf. Never saw or heard from her ever again. 

As for the chio bu, I met her parents, knew her more personally and caught up with her 4 years after sec school. She has a fucked up brother but her mom is extremely nice like her. Her personality is really great and shes now more tactful but still living in her own world like kids with parents owning an S Class and a C class do.

NS:

Ya boi was cool with everyone. Sergeants tried fuckin with me over petty shit but I didnt take it like that. I acted like that weird masochist that loves being scolded and it divided the uncool sergeants and people who think im a weird fuck. The fucking went on for a few weeks until I got more people to hear my story and the non-association with the weird fuck stopped happening. 

Apparently I converted a few people to act like a masochist when said SGT tried fuckin with us and he eventually stopped because shit got too weird. It got to a point where everyone in the platoon except for a few dudes who were mentally challenged (really) was converted and fucked with the SGTs mind until he eventually stopped bullying us and abusing his powers.

After POP we had this post POP zouk party where we told him we were just fucking around and its just not him hearing stuff in his head but us and we were all good. He became the coolest sgt around after hearing the stories of people post my batch.

Around October, I fell really sick, high fever with rashes, took a week MC and afterwards, sinus infection another week of MC. During all of this, my bunk mates, those sleeping with me every time I mount, started dissing on me. Spreading malicious comment about my appearance, make false accusations and scribbling down my initials hoping I die. All because I fell really sick and couldn't mount, they took it personally. From friends turned bullies. I did bring this issue up but they swept it under the rug mostly. Even till this day, some of them ostracize me for it. Lesson learnt.

We had a disagreement and she started hating me, which led to most of the class hating me/not talking to me. They would do the most childish thing like give me dirty glances and whisper when I pass by, it might seem stupid now but it really made me paranoid and probably one of the trigger causes of my anxiety. In the same year, I forgot my textbooks under my desk, went back 30 minutes later to find them gone. Figured one of the bullies must have thrown out my books, I never got them back and it was near exam season.

It made me very mentally tough though, like once you step out of yourself and look at the situation objectively you'll realize that most people that feel the need to bully others do so out of insecurity or they're just plain sadistic assholes who shouldn't be allowed to have an impact on your life.

7mk5ft,druyvdv,"I was the bully. My mum worked at a childcare centre when I was 5. After my session at a different kindergarten, I would be bussed to mum's centre to have lunch and a nap. 

There was this other little girl a year younger than me who was the daughter of one of the teachers there. Because we were children of existing staff, we weren't subject to the usual timetable of the students there so we pretty much did what we wanted. 

I would hide this girl's stuff - mostly hair bobbles and fancy scented erasers - knowing that her mum *really* hated it when her daughter loses her things. So the mum would scold her daughter for being so careless. 

Then one day, I got caught hiding her crayons. Oh, I must preface this by noting that this was during the early 90s when corporal punishment in schools was common. The teachers were allowed to cane misbehaving students in the bathroom but the rule was that the bathroom door had to be left partially open so that the teacher can't be accused of doing nasties to the child inside. So, I got caught and my mum brought me inside the bathroom, pulled down my pants, and caned me with my bare ass on display to all the other children outside. ",1,plumpig,2017-12-29 04:45:09,7mk5ft
7mk5ft,drw4vje,"Got bullied in P4. Was with this group of 3 friends, one of them being my old friend from P3. The main problem comes from the so-called ""ringleader"". As far as possible, my friend tries not to do what the ""ringleader"" asks her to do. At the start, everything was fine, doing stuff that friends normally do like hanging out and all, then it took a  more rebellious turn. Got influenced to copy during Chinese spelling tests, play a fool during class, etc. 

Around near the end of the year, the ""ringleader"" suggested to play truant and submit a ""parents' letter"" with a forged signature. I refused. They started leaving me out, saying that I'm a goody-two-shoes. They even surrounded me and kicked me during recess. Funny shit is that the ""ringleader"" parents had a drink stall in the canteen lol. 

While kicking me they were taunting me to call my brother for help since he was a typical secondary school pai kia then. Mostly it was the verbal abuse and getting left-out on purpose that happened. 

Once, they even squeezed into one bus seat after swimming lessons since the teacher claims that there was a lack of space. Thinking about it now, I shouldn't feel sad about that coz they were being stupid. I got the whole damn seat to myself and they had to squeeze together, one of them was quite big-sized too lmao

Maplestory was a really hot game that time, and this ""ringleader"" hacked into my account and stripped my character of everything lol. 

I did try to tell a trainee teacher posted to my class from NIE, but he just said that we were being naive.

Since my primary school changes class every year, I got into a different class from the ""ringleader"". She did try to continue to disturb me, like tickling me during recess while I was eating noodles. Ended up spitting out the noodles. And I did show that I was pissed. All she did was run away and avoided me for the rest of the year lol. 

Having experienced such bullying myself even though there wasn't physical abuse involved, I had a friend that got constantly name-called and verbally bullied by his group of friends which I was in a band with. They felt that they aren't doing anything wrong. We had this Skype chat, and one day I just asked one of his friends ""Do you think he actually minds the way you guys talk to him sometimes?"" 

The friend said ""He like ok with it leh"", something which kinda triggered me somehow. Those being bullied will show that they are okay usually, but tbh, no one can feel good or feel nothing about someone verbally abusing them. Luckily, this friend listened and said he will try to cut down on the verbal remarks. ",1,Zelmier,2017-12-29 18:56:54,7mk5ft

Primary school:

I went to a girls school and the girls were fine. The bullying came from boys from a mixed school nearby. Bus rides home from school were hell. My bus went the same route as the bus from the mixed school. Whenever our buses stopped beside each other at the traffic light, a group of boys would always point at me and make hand gestures that signified fat/pig/monkey. I cried on the bus a few times and the bus aunty told me to ignore them. It was easier said than done.

Secondary school:

Was good friends with a pretty girl and people kept asking her why she wanted to hang out with an ugly and fat girl like me. 

She used to date a guy from an elite school in Sec 2 and we decided to meet up to study. Her ex bf also brought along his best friend. I was pretty excited because I have never met the boys before and was looking forward. As soon as her ex bf and his friend saw me, they started laughing and whispering to each other. I knew what they were laughing about but tried to ignore it and be friend them. But his friend shouted, “Get away from me you fat ass! Nobody wants to be friends with a fat ass like you.”

My best friend told them to stop being assholes but they continued laughing. She told me to ignore them but I was too scarred by the incident that I decided to head home. Thinking about it today still makes me cry. 

JC wasn’t that bad because everyone was focused on studying so nobody really gave a shit. Plus, I lost weight too. But those incidents left me really awkward around dudes.

7mk5ft,drzmua5,"I'm a German-born Singaporean. Seems unique? I guess, but was taken as an insult during my secondary school phase. When I was Sec 1, I was picked on because I was always the quiet guy in class. Being in a Normal Technical class, the majority of the class were Malay, with a handful of Chinese in the class. I was picked on because I looked nerdy and innocent. During a class in the computer lab, one of my Malay classmate decided to just assault me for no particular reason. I was at my limit and I almost committed murder with a really sharp scissors towards him. But my bloodlust was stopped immediately because the teacher got a hold of me. My country of birth was only made known during Sec 2, as we were required to submit our passports for an overseas trip to Malaysia. My Sec 2 Form Teacher just said, 'Ensure you place your country of birth correctly in the immigration card.' and stared at me. And the entire class knew that I was born in Germany. The most fucked up thing that happened after the trip to Malaysia is that the Malay boys and a number of the Chinese in the class started to call me, 'German Shepherd'. Most of the boys just started to beat me up and just insulted me, calling me a Nazi and such. I just felt that my only safe zone was in my CCA, which was NPCC. The name calling, punches and kicks went on until Sec 4. You may be wondering, why did I not approach any teachers? I did. But to be honest, they were fucking useless in handling my case. They told me to ignore them. How the fuck can I ignore them? Once during Sec 3, I went to the Principal's office to request for a change of school. I just want to get out of this hell. But the Principal just told me to endure for another year and I will be out of here. Well, I can say that my school is just really fucked up regarding bullying. Anyways, after I graduate from Secondary School, I went to ITE. I can just say that ITE was the best time of my life, because I made many friends in class and also CCA.

I'm not saying that schools and the MOE are always right when dealing with bullying, but I assure you that a lot of thought goes into managing each case that we are called to deal with.",7,Calikura,2017-12-28 22:04:15,druod3p

lower pri, got bullied on the sch bus , some guy just hit me on the way back home in the bus, nth much tbh to think of it now, this continued for a while tho, pri sch life was more or less better after that, had a close friend in p6 but drifted ever since uh

sec sch:
sec 1 was bad i guess, all the popz kid formed cliques in the class, was in the most popular clique in class for awhile but slowly got left out.
after that just became lonely in class, sometimes have to find friends to eat during recess, got tease regularly as well. Had once where my friend spit at me when drinking at the water cooler, spit back at him as well LOL. 
 
sec2 was great however, managed to become social and made friends w quite a few peeps, quite memorable times.

sec3 got better ! got into a new class and made friends w everyone :D, the whole year was fun as the class was quite bonded imo.
but towards end of sec3, liked a close female friend, and apparently during dec hol, she got close to another classmate and started dating. 

sec4: everything started gg haywired, that classmate and his clique was popular in class, managed to turn some friends against me, rmb once had my water bottle hidden at the back of the class during recess or smt 

things all changed once i got into poly , found a group of genuine friends that were hardworking as well, so far the best time i had in all the years of education

> I am an overweight guy 

Start lifting and lose that weight. You are 15 and you are hitting puberty right now. Go lurk over at /r/fitness and absorb everything you can like a sponge. If you need a guiding laser, get access to a gym, look up Starting Strength, monitor your food intake. Stop chugging down canned drinks or fast food. This is not just to address that bullying, this is so that you can become the strongest, fittest version of yourself.

> but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with.
> Many people in my class thought I was a stuck up piece of shit or something to that effect.

You didn't give much information behind the reason why you are so painfully selective. I am going to go ahead and assume that you are currently ahead of your peers in terms of maturity, so a lot of their behavior and conversations simply does not appeal to you. In time, they will (hopefully) catch up with you in terms of maturity. There's no need to alienate others or adopt a holier than thou attitude (inferred from your classmate's perception of you). Have you read the book ""How to win friends and influence people""? If not, go read it. I am not going to go deeper in this regard since information is limited, but my advice is, there's always something to learn from everyone you meet.

> there were the handful of retards that took joy in making my life harder than it was.
> others that thought that repeating my name in weird voices around and behind me would be so fucking hilarious

Guys like them like to throw insults and hopefully get a reaction. Realize that no matter the amount of insults they throw, they are all meaningless UNLESS you start taking those insults to heart. People used to make fun of my name in the past too. I say, go ahead and own the insult. Make fun of yourself, join in on the joke and be less serious all the time. Life is short, make merry and laugh.

> everything else can rightfully fuck off

You are angry right now, I get it. I was frequently balls deep in anger during puberty myself (family issues). What I want to tell you here is a rule of life: PERCEPTION IS REALITY. If you let yourself become a hammer, everything you see will be a nail you itch to hit. Be careful of letting your negative experiences color the glasses you see the world through. If you keep harboring negative thoughts towards your classmates, the conscious mind will start to poison your subconscious mind and you will start adopting a negative mindset unknowingly. Go read up on conscious/subconscious, philosophy, etc during your free-time. 

Realize that there will ALWAYS be idiots in this world and what you are doing now is allowing them to poison you. No matter where you go in life, you can never escape them. Instead, learn to be zen about it and not let them affect you instead. With that said, don't forget to leave time for introspection and reflection. Criticism provides the best avenue and direction for growth.

> Criticism won't be appreciated to an equal extent

This attitude won't serve you well especially in the real world. There's no need to direct the kind of responses you get. The onus is on you to filter out what is useful and relevant and what is just hate language designed to bring you down. When people criticize you (even non-constructive ones), thank them and ask them for pointers on where you can do better next time. Such a statement just paints a holier-than-thou impression of you. Refer to earlier rule of life on perception.

> thanks for taking your time to read my sob story. Advice for a teenager ... would be nice

I am going to be presumptuous and call you out here. (Advice would be **nice**?) If your primary objective is to try and get validation, getting people to hear your sob story and feel bad for you, you need to change this attitude. Realize that you are transitioning into an adult soon. No more mommy or daddy to hold your hand and sayang you. The responsibility is on YOU to shape yourself or improve the environment you operate in. You should be aggressively seeking feedback and be CONSTANTLY IMPROVING. Man up and start TAKING ACTION today!

**TLDR**: Hit the gym, lose weight, read books on EQ.

The lack of any mention about teachers being involved in your post makes me curious though. Have you ever considered confiding in any of your teachers? I wouldn't want to take the liberty to say that confiding in your teachers will definitely help solve your problems, but I'd like to think that even being able to share your school troubles with a teacher could help make you feel better and perhaps... have the teacher look out for you more often in school.

> I came to realise that I wasn't bad at socialising, I was actually pretty good at it, but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with.

I don't know why you would be *painfully selective* in who you wanted to be around with, but for me back in my secondary school days, I did feel like there was a disconnect in the kind of things my schoolmates and I would usually talk about. Some of my male schoolmates were all about the latest computer games and I just couldn't find the ""airtime"" in those conversations during which I could talk. Perhaps that's the kind of feeling you have too - I'm not sure.

If there's anything you're good at, whether it's an academic subject or a talent you have, ""show"" it (if you're good at math, teach someone in need; if you can sing/dance, join your school's talent search etc and perform) and let people be curious about your strengths. You then earn the respect from your peers. Be participative, join others in what they're doing (as long as they're not doing something illegal/wrong lah) and find common interests.

> I have a pretty uncommon name - uncommon enough to be made into a joke apparently. I even went to the extent of asking my parents to change my goddamn name, but to no avail so far

Before you do anything, **you need to be confident of yourself**, including your name. Unless your name is Jesus Christ or something really weird that causes considerable reduction in the quality of your life, please don't go thinking that changing your name is going to help solve any of your problems. **Your name is merely what identifies you; it doesn't define you or what you do.**

> I started to develop a bad rep within a sizeable chunk cohort, even amongst people that I didn't know personally and vice versa. I don't even know many of these fucking people and they made (and still are making) fun of me for things that I am and things that I'm not.

I don't know if this helps or whether you've done this, but **speaking up** is really important. If you're accused of being or doing something you're not, be strong and say so. If you're getting a bad reputation just because people are spreading untruths about you, speak to a teacher or someone who can help stop gossip.

The most important thing is to find friends in school whom you can trust. It can be only one or a couple of them - just find friends who will stick by you and, better, speak up for you.

I was teaching music to  elementary kids (around 5-8 years old) and it's nothing like the music class in neighbourhood schools. It's very interactive and you can see all the kids being very excited and active and actually loving the class. I didn't witness any bullying (maybe too young) lots of love all around (platonic of course).  
&nbsp; 
For facilities everything is top notch. They've just recently moved to a bigger space and I kid you not, the science lab has an ocean view. OCEAN VIEW. On the 9th floor! Tons of musical instruments for the kids to learn and some of them joined the orchestra that performs for school events.   
They also have a huge football court and are real fans of playing sports. 
&nbsp;
Another event that I really like is the International Day where the kids get to cook their culture's food or perform some tradition. And they have a few plays in a year with live orchestra. They were really good! I don't remember any of our schools having so much culture. 
&nbsp;
I'm pretty close with the teacher I was assisting so she bitched a lot about the school. Politics is unavoidable so I guess there were a lot of passive aggressive bullying among the teachers.   
Their reaching technic is also very different. When my teacher went for an interview at NIE, she was very upbeat and excited and they didn't like it all. Thankfully she didn't get the job because then this international school loves the over-the-top kind of teaching, where rewards are the only motivators, instead of punishment. In fact, it's almost to the extreme where even if the kid is a douchebag, you have to say it in a positive way to the parents. Absolutely no negativity. Parents here are extremely protective. On parent-teacher day I would think all the teachers have fake smiles and say your kid is great and amazing even if they aren't. 
&nbsp; 
The pay is super high. I heard the lowest pay is to the janitor around $3k per month.    
One thing that stuck with me are the kids. When you're not in class and they notice you, they will run up to you and say ""Hi Ms Fenatellie!!!"" and then giggle and run off. ",31,eilletane,2017-09-23 01:27:34,71pkwp
71pkwp,dncid5h,"I went to intl schools for 11-12 years but I am in a local jc now so I'll try to compare my current school to those. 

ill probably focus on the last one I attended since its an ib school so I can fairly compare it to jc. around a third of the school were prcs who could barely speak English. we also had a lot of white people from many countries and a few more races. 

IB workload is insane. tons of projects and group work assignments that you have to complete. lots of class presentations too. a 4000 word essay that you have to do a ton of research for - it's like a solo PW except I guess there's no oral presentation or evaluation of material. also you actually have to do the solution you come up with unlike pw where everyone and their grandma decides to do an app and eventually just fakes screenshots and mockups using photoshop. the exams are tough but I think a levels are tougher because ib doesn't really have a tys that you can mug. (as in, they don't constantly force you to grind questions because there aren't many to practice. i guess the lack of a tys would make the actual exams harder to revise for)

Just throwing in a quick example of a few ideas our teachers suggested to my friend and I about PW. we got advice from our IT teachers and one of them suggested that my friend contact one of his old friends who runs a school in kazakhastan to code a website for his school. And he would have to analyze his needs for the website, come up with a way to code it, etc for the project. I can't remember if this was for the IA or the EE, but we have to do both for IB anyway. he also suggested that I work together with vendors at sim lim square to set up displays outside their stores/in the windows to have slideshows to showcase the products they sell. apparently there exists specialized software that you can use to display these slideshows (not powerpoint, idk cuz i never ended up doing it) so i would have to volunteer to set up a PC and install this stuff for them.

my teachers were incredibly nice and fun to listen to. they don't really throw tantrums all the time like local jc teachers and are a lot more calm and collected. I'd they have an issue with you they will probably talk to you after class instead of blowing up at you in class. my math teacher was this old english lady who was really snarky and sarcastic, her classes were always fun. however our physics teacher was kinda crazy and would yell a lot. I didn't take physics but we would occasionally hear him through the walls and us bio kids would pray for our friends beyond the wall. he was a cool guy outside class though. Our IT teachers were geeks and their classes were really fun since they were very passionate about IT and knew a lot about the latest trends and stuff.

facilities are really nice. we had a ""common room"" in the library which was a big old classroom that they emptied out. it had a ton of beanbags and tables and chairs and a sofa. I remember bringing a few extra tables in and having lan parties during lunch with my friends. everyone was forced to buy a Macbook so we didn't have too many games to choose from but luckily cod4 ran on Mac so we would play multiplayer on that. all of our classrooms were air conditioned, a lot of them had random beanbags we could use and some had carpets. it was really comfy. WiFi was slow as fuck during lunch break though. eventually gaming during lunchtime started to become a pretty big issue since it was happening everywhere so the decided to open up this big classroom on the top floor during lunch for people to play games in, so that the rest of the school wouldn't have to deal with us hogging tables to play cod or minecraft which was really popular amongst the younger students. however they also had a teacher there to supervise us (although he literally did nothing tbh) so we decided to stick to the common room so we could swear at each other for camping/dropshotting/spawnkilling/using shotguns etc

cca participation is really important. my main cca was dungeons and dragons (a teacher was the GM) but we could also choose to help out other ccas for CAS hours (like VIA but we need to clock 120 hours to pass ib). I helped out the Minecraft cca with my friend. it was run by one of my teachers. it's actually for the younger kids from like p4 to sec2 but we were allowed to join as helpers. they all played on a single server and we had admin characters so we could fly around and spawn items etc. our job was basically to teleport lost kids back to their friends but we also did fun stuff like changing our movement speed to fly around while dropping sacs of invisible ink on the kids to turn them invisible. in jc I just kinda slacked off in cca and did nothing but in intl schools it's a lot more involved and fun. 

The students are nice but it depends on how you behave. we had one dude who was a little weird and had a thick accent and he got made fun of sometimes. not directly, they would act snarky to him and I'm not sure if he even realised they were making fun of him. but tbh he was a real creep so idk. most of the students there are very accommodating and friendly towards other people, even if you have a weird accent or whatever as long as you're nice and not creepy. lots of very unique people with many different hobbies and back stories since they all come from different countries. whereas in jc everyone just talks about mugging for o levels, playing dota/maple at lan cafés and watching anime/kdramas. nothing wrong with those hobbies since I'm like that too but nobody really stands out here compared to back then. 

(hitting submit now because I'm on 1% battery, will try to add stuff in as i remember them)

classes are a lot slower paced and fun. for example we had to read a book for our English class and we once spent a double period lying on bean bags on the floor watching the movie adaptation of that book on the projector. We also spent a few IT classes watching documentary on AI. It feels a lot less rushed than JC. 

also substance abuse is a lot more common there and they are really chill about it. some of it illegal too.

I recently visited the campus again because I wanted to take pictures of their video editing room (which was a lot more impressive when i used to study there tbh, it got downsized recently but they still had a greenscreen and cameras etc) and apparently they have a 3D printing room now. It has a ton of 3D printers and the teacher showing me around showed me some pokeballs he made and a few other models made by the students. The art rooms are very cool but I didn't go there often. Except this one time when the school decided to get the students to make tiny clay models of themselves (the clay that you use for pottery, not play-doh) so we all had to go there and make mini stick figures of ourselves. They later put them all up for display in the middle of some room which was quite cool.

The community is really nice, and the events they host are awesome. My favourite one was this one time when we hosted a film festival for students from other intl schools across SG, since i participated in that and got $100 lol. It was really fun watching everyone's films and the production value was pretty high. JC events feel really half-assed in comparison - i think it would be really cool if we had some kind of inter-jc film competition but everyone is too busy mugging for a levels so i doubt that would happen.",61,,2017-09-23 00:45:18,71pkwp
71pkwp,dnckd14,"It's a like a normal school with lower work-loads, More CCA options and far lower grade boundaries because our grades are bounded to the world rather than Singapore.

For the IGCSE our advance classes are at the same level of normal Singapore o-level classes with far lower grade boundaries. A 75% in economics gives you the highest possible grade meaning that cramming in the form found in most local school basically doesn't exist. There are some people that struggle still and have to go to remedial tuition at math-vison centre but by-an large most people do fine without it.

Bullying in the way depicted in tv is basically non-existent but social orcastrism still exists like in all schools, Most people are nice but there is this attitude of unknown privilege and extreme partying that tends to rub me the wrong way.  Teachers are amazing and never seem like they hate teaching or won't help you, they support most of your projects and such.

71pkwp,dncnlsm,"I’m currently studying in one of the 3 ‘local’ international schools, namely – SJI Intl; ACS Intl: and HCIS. I came from a neighbourhood primary and secondary school so my response would only cover the IB student life. 
These schools are considered more ‘local’ by virtue that more Singaporeans are found in these schools than other international schools and because they are members of the well-established institutions. The reason why I came to an international school despite being a Singaporean was solely to pursue the IB diploma. I was initially aiming to enter the independent schools but fell short of their academic requirements. (Prelims gave me hope by granting me a streak of A1s, but I didn’t study much for actuals cause I got too cocky) And here I am. I am very thankful for my parents who granted me the opportunity to pursue the diploma programme despite only coming from a upper middle income family. 
Academics

**Curriculum**:

In my school, the year 1-4s take the IGSE examinations (which are supposedly easier than Os, never sat for it so I wouldn’t want to speculate here) Upper school refers to those taking the 2 year IB programme. 
Classes: 8am – 4pm (It gets shortened to around 3pm when you’re in year 2, depending on how many free periods you have in your time-table)

Staff: Mostly friendly, although I’ve experienced staff staying for a short as 3 months before leaving the school. For one, my physics teacher was replaced 3 times within the first year. I’m guessing there’s less taboo about quitting a job at a private school than a government one. 
The teachers are a mix of ex-MOE JC teachers and foreign teachers. Not every staff is a Caucasian, in fact, only 2 who I see walking around mostly are Caucasian. The rest are of Chinese or Indian ethnicity.

Classes are held in blocks of 1 hour, with each day covering at least 5 of your 6 chosen subjects. In year 2 you may get more free periods depending on what subjects you took. Every class in held in a classroom (yes, all fully air-conditioned), unlike the lecture-tutorial style of instruction you see in local JCs. Perhaps, this would be the case only for mass lectures during Theory of Knowledge slot because it’s a mandatory subject for all.
There’s a overseas trip to a neighbouring country like Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos in Year 1 too. (CAS stuff) It stands for Creativity, Activity and Service. Basically CIP and CCA with more self-initiative.

**Social Life**
Alright, let’s talk another big part of school life. Friends….
I’m probably the least qualified to speak on this subject because I only have a close circle whom I stick to for lunch and for sharing notes etc. The school is largely split into 2 distinct groups, the PRC students, the Singaporean students and the other nationalities make up a small minority. The PRC students live in the school boarding and are super tight when it comes to social situations. Most of them hardly talk to the Singaporean kids. I’m guessing because of cultural and language barriers, perhaps? Yea, so being in an international school does not automatically make your social circle more international, it really boils down to how much you want to get out of your comfort zone. 

Probably one benefit has been than my conversational Mandarin has improved since I enrolled.

The local students are, as you expect, belonging to higher income brackets. I can probably count only 3 people in year 1 and 2 who live in HDBs (myself included). If you’ve ever read Crazy Rich Asians, it’s about 70% accurate. It might be higher if you get real friendly with them and get to see the full potency of their father’s net worth hahahaha. They’re mostly snobs with no sense of their standing outside of the school. Some of them are so knee-deep in their self-centred fantasy that you’d be wondering if you were living in a teenage sit-com. Even so, there are some nice locals around who are more humble and approachable. 

**Food**
Technically speaking my school has 4 canteens. But most of the international school students go to only 2 of them. One of them is cheaper and better tasting but is further away from the school. It’s not even a decision for me, the cai png and nasi briyani is too good. I always eat at the ‘cheap and good canteen’. Prices at the expensive canteen can range anywhere from 4 to 7 dollars for a plate. 
I spend 3 dollars on average for a super filling meal at the other canteen. 
There’s also a café that sells overpriced snacks, cakes and other tidbits. Not a fan of that either.

**CCA**
Well… If you wanna join a CCAs you gotta pay a fee. Anywhere between $300 to $500 is a good estimate. But that’s probably a drop in the ocean for some of the kids who enrol here. I don’t have a CCA because IB has this CAS component which is sorta a CCA in itself already. There’s all sorts of shit like Indoor Skydiving at Sentosa’s ifly place. I think the yearly fee was like 1K?? Yea but everyone’s ballin’. 

**Facilities**
I’m currently studying in the new building now, it’s pretty cool. Great classrooms and lots of studying corners. The PE stuff is in pretty bad shape tho, the ‘mini-track’ has bumps and cracks which does all sort of magic for your knees when you run on the; the students usually bring their own equipment if they wanna play a certain sport that day etc.
Oh we ‘have’ a swimming pool, but we don’t use it. It’s right next to the school but no one here has dip a single toe into it. :(

I think that’s it, imma go back to studying for now but I’m free to answer any questions yall have!!!

Workload is rather ok, but I would argue the environment here is better.Unlike local schools, the students here are more diverse and fun to interact with. Additionally, you could talk about international current affairs and most students would know what you are talking about, quite different from local schools, where if you ask a student about international politics, most would have no clue. 

Subjects here are also more diverse, offering econs, business studies, psychology, religious studies, etc. The sciences here are all pure, not combined. In general, some subjects are easier then others, for example, E maths is easier but A maths is harder.

Not to mention the connections you can make here.You have the super rich/ social media ""influenza"" students. Yes, some of them are pure cancer, but the connections might help you in the future. Some of my friends are relatively wealthy, but they still are nice and humble. Those are the people you want to stick close too.

71pkwp,dndedhg,"Went to an international school and it was awesome. 

Did the IB Diploma and the IGCSE while I was there and those programs really helped me prepare for life in uni tbh. The IB was so demanding but still so well rounded (not just focused on academics) that it taught me really good time management skills and how to function outside of just doing well at school. I actually even got credit for some classes in first year uni from the IB that I went straight to second year for some subjects, and when people were freaking out over 5k word essays I was like meh I've done this before in high school. The exams were hard and stressful like all exams are but I didn't feel like we were ever under prepared by teachers or whatever. I was also more aware of other cultures and cultural differences, and it really helps in the workplace etc. deal with differences between people. My experience at an international school has really built me into a 'global citizen', I feel like I can adapt easily to change and live anywhere. 

The classes were very interactive, and the teachers treated you as equals at a young age, which really fostered an environment in which people were not afraid to ask questions and learn. Sports and arts (like drama, music and visual arts) were very highly regarded and encouraged, as well as doing well in the classroom. They would also have cool things like United Nations day with heaps of cultural performances and food stalls selling food of that country. 

In addition, the school I went to recognised that its students were largely from very privileged backgrounds and placed an emphasis on giving back to the community, whether local or international. For example, I volunteered heavily with an organisation which assists foreign domestic workers and construction workers, while friends of mine worked with organisations in Thailand or Vietnam. 

Of course there was a lot of partying and all that on the weekends, but eh that's being a teenager everywhere really. There's also bullying that happens as kids everywhere are assholes but rich kids are even more assholey but it generally gets picked up on and shut down by the teachers very quickly. A lot of rich stuck up people go to international schools but a lot of very nice, humble ones do too. I've made some lifelong friends from high school and they love across the world. The potential for networking globally is massive once you graduate. 

Also I'm sure I've missed something so feel free to ask me anything. ",5,minkums,2017-09-23 12:42:29,71pkwp
71pkwp,dnel9a7,"Went to a UK independent school, but most of my life was spent in an international school overseas. I did spend some time back in SG, but here are some things I loved.

Classes were smaller, air-conditioned classrooms were a must and lessons consisted of us making learning quite interactive with the use of laptops. We had a wider range of activities - every student was given the opportunity to shine in any field they chose and they were encouraged to take it to a very high level. In terms of homework, we could choose to type our work up and print it out. 

Since I was boarding (in the UK independent school), it was all these + a really welcoming and inclusive community. We had a couple of ensembles and orchestras in which I participated actively and I also played hockey, touch rugby and swam when I could. Also, Model United Nations was quite popular.

Enjoyed it quite a lot. For a brief year, I did come back to Singapore. Oh hell, the culture shock hit hard. Noped right out of here as quickly as I could and could never be more thankful. Still a proud Singaporean, though. Kudos to you who have made it through the SG system and came out alive. :P

71pkwp,dncqhy6,"Only students from kindergarten all the way to grade 10 needs to wear uniforms, senior students in grade 11-12 in high school like me don't have to wear uniforms, instead, they have to wear the school ID. The school also allows students to wear any shoes provided they are not sandals or flip flops. OFS is a pretty spacious school with lots of facilities such as gyms, olympic size swimming pool, playground and rugby fields. The students and the teachers are super friendly and social and it's very easy to mingle with them. Some of the friends that I have made are with teachers because they are pretty cool and have a great personality. The cultural diversity is insane, there are students from over 108 different countries including Singapore as well. As for the academic part, our school offers IB, IGCSE and MYP. I am currently studying the IB and the workload is pretty insane. We have 8 subjects to study which includes 3 higher level subjects, 3 standard level subjects, TOK(theory of knowledge) and PE. The school starts at 9am and finishes at 3:30 pm. The time table for a middle school student and high school student is different. So as a high school student, my daily timetable consists of homebase for 15 mins, 2 subject periods for one hour each until 11:05 am, then its followed by break for 25 mins, and there is two more class periods after break until 1:25pm. Then we have lunch for one hour followed by a last subject period until 3:30pm. The classes are pretty fun and relaxing and there is no pressure on students. The school bus service in the school is really expensive, but luckily, for those who choose to take the public transport instead, the school runs a feeder shuttle bus service from the school to Pasir Ris Mrt for free of cost and its very frequent, meaning that the waiting time for the next shuttle bus is small. Life at OFS is pretty fun as the school emphasises the importance of having a balanced life which consists of spending considerable time on academics, as well as having a social life with friends and family which is really great. The school year consists of 2 semesters, where semester one is from august-december and semester two from janurary-may. We do have two major holidays which is the Christmas holiday for 1 month long in december and the summer holidays for 2 and a half months long from june-july and the first half of august as well.

71pkwp,dndrgy8,"i don't really know much about them. I think most western international schools probably have the same atmosphere and teaching styles (laid-back, not as restrictive as jc etc). But since GEMS is newer it doesn't really have the same brand reputation as UWCSEA and stuff. They probably won't have as much money either - my school still had stuff like a swimming pool and sports facilities but nowhere near as good as uwc and stuff who have a metric fuckton of cash to spend. but the facilities are still way better than local jcs. However one thing i noticed was that my school didn't have dedicated labs for science practicals - instead my bio/chem classroom had equipment around us that we could use, but we had to do them in groups of 2-3 instead of individually like jc. tbh i'm not sure if IB even has a practical exam, you'll have to look that up, so I don't know if that is a big deal. i'm guessing the top schools will probably have enough apparatus for everyone to work individually but you'll have to ask someone else for info on that, like that guy in this thread who studies in OFS.

The newer schools will have fewer people which leads to a more close-knit environment, if that's your thing. My school only had two classes in grade 12 (IB). Since GEMS is newer I'm assuming it will be similar. However GEMS has been around for a long time in other countries like the middle east, it's just their singapore campus that is new. It seems like they are getting bigger though. Smaller cohorts are also good because it makes it easier to qualify for overseas exchange trips and stuff. in JC you compete with hundreds of students to go on these trips but in my schools it was a lot easier since we had a smaller cohort. 

I honestly don't know much about SAIS, but their facilities seem really good. I doubt the teaching would be any different from the others since they are also an IB school and have western teachers.

I would recommend visiting these schools during an open house day or something and see if they'll give you a tour or let you walk around. My school did that once a year so the others probably do too. My school got students to do the tours rather than teachers so you could probably ask them about their experience at the school for a more honest opinion than what their websites offer.",3,,2017-09-23 17:40:27,dndjods

And /u/kerochanscheck is right, UWC is generally hard to get into even for paid students.

I indulged myself in eating as one of my ways to relieve the stress and gained weight and the bullies picked on me even more. I had no energy to study, no hobbies except for gaming because classmates would picked on me when i played some sports with them. I hated the school, hated my home. I spend most of the time in my room playing computer games. It was the worse period of my life. I cried everyday. In the toilet, in the elevator, under my blanket and also cried while using my computer. I did not talk to anyone because i dont feel that i can trust anyone. Im a nice kid who dont do bad things but when my mum lost her money she kept asking if i took it. She kept using police and say that they will catch me and say that if i admit she would not do anything. Its like police interrogating a criminal. (If you admit your crime, we will lighten your sentence those kind of bullshit). My brother would force me to go to church and pinch me if i forgot to do something for him for his facebook games.

Everyone is different. I do not know what anyone have went through and everyone has different ways to feel better. I would say first if something or someone really aggravates you, just stay away from them as much as possible. Find things that you can enjoy alone. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE GOOD OR BAD AT IT. Computer games, fishing, cycling, gym, swimming and so on. Just find something that you feel ok with doing EVEN IF YOU ARE BAD. Doing things that you enjoy a tiny amount at least will stop you from thinking that tiny amount of time which is at least better for you. AND DO NOT HOLD BACK YOUR TEARS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYING WHEN YOUR SAD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYING WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY DONT CARE ABOUT HOW OTHER SEE YOU.

To those out there who are still struggling, and afraid of seeking help, please do so. It is not your fault or anyone's fault we are like this, the public judges us but we know we are just souls who need some extra care which is totally fine. There is no shame in requiring extra care. Depression is still a highly stigmatized topic/condition in singapore but just because of that doesn't mean we should ignore it. It is a very serious condition which can affect ones life for a long period of time.

As some replied, when we have a flu or fever we see the doctor and we get better. So why don't we do so for depression? Because of public perception. However does public perception really matter? If They can't see the good in you, do they matter? We are enough and we deserve to be loved, cared and to recover. What I vision for myself is that, one day I will be able to tell people hey, I had depression, so what? I'm now stronger than ever, with more empathy for others because I know how badly it can hurt. If someone is going to judge me for that, I believe that it's their personality that has an issue.

One thing I really hate about our society is that it appears so cold, everyone is just out there to eat each other (which could be the reason why people don't seek help) but I believe that just one person, one person can make a difference. Everyone has their own struggles, are fighting some sort of fight. Just because you are losing doesn't mean you are weak. If I were to put it this way, when we fight a boss in some online games, we seek help if it's tough, we party up. Depression is probably one of the biggest boss I've ever met and would be the hardest one. I've crumbled and failed to defeat him so many times, but it could be because I'm constantly trying to defeat it on my own. So for me, I will party up with those around me, with those that care for me. They stuck with me through this hard times and it's not fair for me to just put them aside.

Famous celebrities such as Ellen Degeneres, Johnny Depp, Eminem, Chris Evans ( Captain America), Lady Gaga and so many more suffered from depression in their early life, some even more severe than you but they certainly didn't choose to give up which is why they made it out and they are influencing people to fight depression now.

I'll be blunt, no afterlife, if you commit suicide, you will never return, stay here, fight depression, change the world.

Good luck.

8pquof,e0dq6cu,"One thing many people don't understand about depression is that you can have everything you ever wanted in this world, but still feel so alone and unhappy. OP, you don't have to feel guilty about it. Your family and your gf loves you for who you are, you are more than your depression.

My mind haven't been in the right place for more than 4 years now. The crippling loneliness and countless failures over the last few years has just made me more weary if anything else. It just seems like every time I try so hard, I just falter at the end. I can never get anything right. Nothing is ever going my way.

When I was younger, and I was more carefree, I didn't understand what depression was. I had a table partner in secondary school who had a habit of cutting herself. I tried to help her and be there for her despite not understanding what was wrong with her. But deep inside at that time, I thought it was something that she just needed to ""get over"", a phase of sorts.

Until depression hit me 4 years ago. I can actually remember the exact trigger. It is an inexplicable sadness that hits you when you least expect it to. I can be okay for long stretches of time, and then boom I want to kill myself. There are times where death sounds more like a relief than a thing to fear. When I had the thought of killing myself for the first time, I was terrified. I knew I had a problem but I didn't want to admit to it. I don't want to be labelled as sick or depressed. The few friends I have and my family doesn't know or care. I have never been in a relationship because no one loves me but neither do I have the emotional capacity to love anyone. How can I expect love when I don't know how to love? The idea of an intimate relationship scares the crap out of me. I am envious of people who can have functioning relationships with friends and family. 

Sometimes I do second guess myself and suspect that all I want is attention and that I might just be faking my own depression. My mind just keeps fucking with me. 

I still don't understand depression. I really don't understand how our mind is capable of self\-destructive tendencies when we are supposed to be wired for self preservation. But lately I have been toying with the idea of seeking formal help because I am really sick of self pity and I want to exert some control over my life for once.",3,,2018-06-10 05:26:53,8pquof

I've had the chance to experience both private and public (subsidised) psychiatrists. I can affirm your experience that the ones at public hospitals / polyclinics are crap - basically just don't bother. 

These however are merely my experiences are you have to decide for yourself what you want to do moving ahead. You clearly need help and may want to consider going back on meds. The meds take a few weeks to kick in so don't delay. When was the last time you were on it? Did you stop it abruptly? You're supposed to taper off slowly. 

Many people just don't know how to deal with those with depression. Some just think that it's something you can ""get over"". These are people who've never had to deal with depression in their lives and will never understand. That doesn't mean they don't care. They just don't know how to care.

Please just know that this depressed version of you isn't the real you. The real you is that wonderful person your girlfriend fell in love with. The current you is someone who's been ravaged by this horrible disease and crying for help.

if only it is so simple. mental illness remains heavily stigmatised because people like you and OP's brother makes it seems depression can be solved with a snap of a finger. depression can be triggered by the most random thought in the most unexpected moment, sometimes even medication doesn't work. it's the mysterious workings of our minds which cause us to feel dark and alone and all the negative stuffs.

when cancer goes through remission, doctors never vouch for a ""full recovery"" or ""no relapse"". depression is the same in a lot of ways.

what if I'm honest with myself, yet I'm still in the constant cycle of mood swings again and again and again? its not good advice if you're placing more expectation, and in turn more pressure on someone who is already depressed. many times people are depressed because they are too honest with what is going on around them.

what we are saying is, depression is just like any illness in the body. it can be chronic or one time affair, who knows? but with medical and emotional help we can still be a healthy and functional individual. and we want to be treated the same.

but don't tell me there can be forever sunshine because there's no such thing as forever sunshine. it's a fucking lie.

Anything, no matter how small or trivial, you can latch yourself to for you to stay afloat. Use those behavioral therapy methods, making small changes bit by bit. I know it sucks, but without medication, I feel it’s best to just keep your head above the water until it blows over. 

It’s very important that you don’t remain idle though. Setting up new habits and routines can be helpful in breaking the cycles of negative thought, I find. Cognitive therapy might be your best recourse now that you don’t think medication might be the best.

If you really can’t get your mind off those negative thoughts about yourself, talk to someone who can use conversation to let you distill those thoughts into a clearer picture of the mess in your mind. That’s something that helped me. Might work for you too. 

Your family doesn’t understand, but millions around the world do. I can talk to you regularly if you want. Not even about this stuff. It might be best to talk about everything except this, even.

They have tried the counselling and the psychiatrist medication, so I'm not sure what is the next step. Even he isn't able  to articulate what exactly makes him unhappy. 

If what makes him unhappy is exactly what he says, that is that he feels a lack of purpose in life, there are many ways to deal with that issue. One is to change his mindset about what a purpose in life means, and I believe that to be really helpful. If you are able to change your expectations in life you'd be happier. The second thing he can try to to clearly identify his expectations and how he can work to reach there, at least there will be a concrete plan to work ahead.

I don't believe that saying ""I'm depressed, there is nothing you can do that will be helpful"" is helpful in any way. 

Unless you believe that depression is like heart diseases where your heart is damaged and you can't make it better unless you go for a heart transplant, which I wouldn't agree with you.

I feel comments like this are what makes people depressed and what makes OP worse. According to you, not living life a certain way means you are living life without a purpose and you are just living day-to-day. And then you try you make people who don't work in a purpose you deem worthy to feel lacking and empty. 

There is no reason to feel this way, you need to open up your mind. There are many ways to live life, and many ways to find purpose and not just society approved ones. This little guy is still schooling, there is a long way to go for him to find a cause he feels worthy to dedicate his life to.

8pquof,e0dj2aw,"I just thought the equation might not be as straightforward as you lay it out to be. ""let's do this or that and everything will be right"". a common cause of depression is not achieving an expected result set upon oneself or others. why is it I've tried a hundred methods yet I still seem to fail? it's a bloody abyss to even think of it

of course we would like OP to feel better and I believe every depressed person wants to feel better. but it's different from telling people ""you're not doing this that's why you're like this"", or ""do this and you won't feel like that"" or ""just get on with life"" as if every depression should be treated in the same manner. it's better to be honest and accept it might not be always rainbow and butterflies, but we want to help ourselves manage and lead a normal life. I think it's smoother to think this way and alleviate the burden on one's shoulder. after all people do get well waking up one fine day without doing anything (not that I will recommend this way also)

we need to acknowledge depression is a constant fight which all of us hope to see light at the end of the day.

anyway we are having a very open discussion and I don't find the need to be so passive aggressive or deleting comments. especially in a post where all of us relate to the desire for acceptance of ourselves and the community at large.

8pquof,e0dlryp,"Well you can start by understanding that I'm actually a real doctor. Not a psychiatrist but a real doctor nonetheless.

The current hypothesis for depression is that it is due to a person's inability to deal with rising cortisol levels that can arrive from stress or other mean. This affects serotonin transmission and make the person fall into a dark hole. So the key to dealing with this is to identify what causes the rising stress that you can't cope with and deal with it in the first place.


>Having depression/anxiety is like having your brain falling sick for example the flu. You can't tell some to just stop sneezing or coughing

According to this, you can get someone to stop sneezing and coughing if you are able to get rid of the flu virus infecting the respiratory tract.

Thus, according to you, you should be able to get someone to stop being depressed if you get rid of the whatever is making your brain sick.

4uwaei,d5tfbte,"Hi, I'm 20 and in an SG university right now. Myself and many of my friends have gone through the same depression and helplessness with the education system here, and we have all made it out whole and happier. Your post here tells me that you're feeling inspired to work harder and gain your footing, which really warms my heart. I really that you to know what I'm sure you can do it, not just the traditional route (aka Os and A levels) but the non-traditional as well. Happiness and success is not contingent on the path, just the journey and the lessons learnt. 

Some of my friends have gone overseas to study, either in a community college (usually America) or a foundational year in a university (usually UK). These options have been rewarding. The change of environment has been trying but its inspired many people and many of them seem to be heading towards brighter futures that us here, hah. 

Of course, the options above are only open to those who can afford it. I don't personally know anyone who's going through the route you're proposing, but there are definitely many people who take Os as private candidates. When I took my Os, we had about two dozen private candidates in the hall with us. It can definitely be done. 10 months is honestly enough time to get ready for Os. If you balance out the next 10 months between studying and taking breaks (very important to take care of your mental health), I'm sure you can do it. I'd recommend seeing a therapist at IMH if you have difficulty with your depression. At your age, you'll be assigned to the children's side. It employs a different method than the adult's section, as it's less about exploring the ""depths"" of your psyche and more about streamlining your feelings and motivations, and nudging you towards what makes you happy, ie what is important to you.  

I would recommend you to do your O levels first, and worry about your A levels later. Take small steps, set short-term goals. Start by putting in the work, enjoy the small victories, and then repeat. You can do it, believe me. If you take anything away from my comment, I hope it's that:

1. I believe in you
2. Balance between work and reward (something that you will have to learn, because no one is born with it)
3. Setting short-term goals and focusing on them, reward yourself when you achieve them.

I am not you and I don't know your exact circumstances but I can tell you if you think studying is going to make your life better, you can't be more wrong. Unless you are sure you know what your end goal is, don't study for the sake of studying. Have you seen university fees? Are the fees worth it? 

There are so many mindless people in Singapore that still go through the motion. Study PSLE > O > A > Uni. Finish Uni, work in ""dream job"". And here's the kicker, find out that the dream job is not really the dream job then end up doing something totally irrelevant instead. 

The world is changing so, so fast. What can earn money today may not be able to earn money tomorrow. IT, Bio, banking, even oil and gas cannot escape this cycle. The similarity in all these industries is that only the top 1% really earns a lot. And what do these 1% have in common? The passion that can take all burnouts. 

In my generation, the trend was to study banking, accounting and business. In my class alone, I can tell the business students all are unlikely to start their own business. Most are clueless and just hop into the hype. 

So what can you do ? Ask yourself what you really enjoyed when you were younger. If you don't have an answer, now is the time to find side jobs or go to the library to find out what you love to do in life. 18 is still considered very young and still a good time to make mistakes. As you get older, mistakes will be crippling. So now's the time for you to go out explore.

4uwaei,d5uhqxg,"You're gonna need at least the O levels to get anywhere in Singapore. eg, Full time or Part time diploma. You never really stated what you're interested to read in university. There are some alternate ways to enter University in the UK.

Take for example, University of London's foundation program 

http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/courses/foundation/uol-international-programmes/international-foundation-programme

One program I found that does not require any formal qualifications to start is this ~

https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/about/advanced-diploma-in-data-and-systems-analysis

But if you don't have an understanding of math, it might be a tad tricky.

There's also some options to study with a US. university via some online courses. finish up an associates degree from Singapore (online) then move over to the US, to finish your full degree. It's open entry - so you don't need to show O/A levels. Most likely need to show IELTS or some English proficiency test.

http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Your-Associate%E2%80%99s-Degree-Online

Penn State (pretty decent reputation) actually offers an associates degree online

http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/directory/undergraduate/associate

in the US context, an associates degree is like the first 2 years of a 4 year degree program. once you've done with it, you go to a university to finish year 3/4.

Another option you can consider in your position right now is to sign up with Open University Australia. They have a university entry program.

https://www.open.edu.au/courses/

Open U is open entry. You don't need to show any O/A levels. Just sign up for each module and finish it. Slowly progress. You'll need 24 modules to graduate with a full degree, or do some and transfer over to Oz to finish a degree on campus.

Everything I've listed is basically open entry if you're going to consider skipping O/As.

4uwaei,d5ynjrh,"I think if you are looking to have a (professional) entry level job in Singapore you should aim towards one of two paths - (1) getting a diploma or (2) a degree. This doesn't have to be in medicine or accountancy or any of the typical singaporean paths, but something that you're interested and feel you can see a career in (nursing, computing, hotel management, real estate etc). Some other redditors have suggested following your passion and not bothering to get a degree. That is possible, if you're into non-traditional industries and very sure of what you want to do e.g. entrepreneurship or retail etc. However, unfortunately, for all other ""professional"" jobs e.g. nursing that require training, given how Singapore's economy works, you probably need either a diploma or degree.

To this end, you need to ultimately 

(1) get a diploma through
a poly
NIE (if you're into teaching)
a private institution (there are many part time 1 year diplomas http://www.academiccourses.com/Diploma/Singapore/)

The prerequisites for getting these diplomas are usually O levels. Therefore, I think you should indeed take the O levels once you feel you are ready and have studied enough. But I don't know how to take this as a private candidate and if it's advisable to take this without going through some sort of school. Someone I know did 'A' levels as a private candidate and ended up much worse than if he would have been if he'd enrolled in JC/MI/poly because he simply didn't have the resources/structure of school and lessons. Since it seems like you can afford it (?) maybe you should consider enrolling in private schools outside to help prepare you? I know for A levels / degree there are many like MDIS/Pearson but I'm not sure about for O levels.

(2) alternatively, if you are aiming for a degree, you might want to consider overseas universities in particular America. American unis  ONLY REQUIRE SATs and not any other qualifications. SATs are relatively easier to study for than 'A' and 'O' levels. SAT I consists of english comprehension MCQs + secondary 2 level maths. It's gruelling (4 hour examination) but the content is very manageable without having O levels and singaporeans do way above their american counterparts. SAT II is a subject test, you choose your subjects you want to sit for and they have many guidebooks available in the library to help you with. And some local uni courses also take into consideration your SAT scores if you lack qualifications! I believe SMU is one example. But maybe you can do this after you take your 'O' levels while waiting for the results.

I don't have much knowledge on the matter so i hope the information I give you isn't wrong! All the best I really admire your determination. You sound like you've had a horrible past but I just want you to know that even though I haven't personally experienced it, I know people who have managed to overcome it all :) You can do it! Even if the steps seem really small and slow but you'll get to a happier place. Please don't ever give up hope!!",1,sweetnothingnessx,2016-08-01 11:33:58,4uwaei
4uwaei,d5zgm15,"* Hello! I took a conventional O->A->local university route so here's my advice. Don't study for the A-levels on your own. Do well for ""O"" levels, enrol into a polytechnic course and graduate with a diploma first. If you do well, you can enter a local university (I have many friends who took that route). If you can't enter a local university, at least you'll have a diploma which will guarantee you a certain starting salary. Many MNCs will promote someone who works hard, even if that person does not possess the necessary paper qualifications. With a diploma, you could also enrol into SIM and obtain a degree part-time while working to cover your school fees. 
* I don't advise studying for the A levels on your own. I'm an honours student from a local university who came from a shit JC but ended up doing better than my peers from the top JCs. I found the A levels immensely difficult. Without my incredible JC tutors, I would have scraped through. Many of my classmates did very badly, and could not enter a local university. Several went to private universities, and one re-enrolled into a polytechnic. Personally, i think the polytechnics are a better bet. ",1,,2016-08-02 03:31:14,4uwaei

4uwaei,d5tzpxz,"let uncle advise you.

first of all, i'm really happy that you woke up awhile back and is on your track! not to say that you are also very young so there are so much opportunity ahead.

to be honest, uncle here (i'm 30+ almost mid 30s), when i was young, i listen to others for what to study. those people are in their 50ish now and what they told me was to become engineer.

i took their advise since i'm good at computers and programming, took up this ultra boring subject and hey guess what? i excel in radio and now working for telecom. they pay isn't great but it is definitely better then other engineering except energy sector. ( our pay are roughly near 70k for people who are in this industry for 3-5 years and of course hardwork). but the problem here is that uncle did not listen to myself when i was young. i like programming as it is extremely easy, much easier than EEE itself, now green eye seeing my peer getting better pay for the knowledge i also know. >:(

what even worst is that other industries such as accounting, finance, shipping etc are doing extremely well and they are getting the similar pay as what i'm getting now.

i'm trying to get across you is that, what you study now is your future job, do you see yourself in that field?

next would be that it is great if you have your hobby as work but there are danger to it that your future customer may not like your work and demand changes which cross you. ended up you might lost interest in that hobby which sucks.

listening to others is good for reference, not as a decision. because you at 18 now KNOWS better what is for the future ahead than me who can only do and predict the next 20 years ahead. you should decide that kind of work you would like to be end of the day.

there are some sections that are forever needing people and not really tough job yet very secure such as accounting. every company need to account their $$, they may not need professionals in other field which can be outsourced. it may be extremely boring and tired to count and count but the money you take back is so good.

lastly, take a job that can fetch you good money should be what you take end of the day imho as long as it can fuel your hobbies. work is just work, enjoyment is what you want as a person.

wish you good luck!!",-5,idetectanerd,2016-07-28 19:41:37,4uwaei

If you have a hobby or passion in a specialised field (baking, cooking, making video games, art) then I'd say going to a specialised school and developing your passion in those skills might hold better prospects than pursuing a more common general degree.

Top schools like Harvard offer business courses to allow mid-career professionals to network and make transition to a new endeavor.

1. Get your O level done in a year. 

2. Register to go NYP / NP nursing (there's 2 nursing schools now)
Nursing is considered a dumping course. The requirements to enter with a O level cert is amongst the lowest. 

3. If you are low in cash, sign bond and you get paid to study. But if you can afford it, obviously don't sign the bond. Just listing your options here. 

4. Graduate from school. Work approximately 2-3 years in SGH if possible whilst considering where you want to go. The next step will be a degree which can also be sponsored. The degree you choose will affect where you can go so think carefully here. Obviously Australia one is recognize in Aussie while UK one is recognize in UK. Some countries will recognize degrees from other countries. Its your job to find out which is :)

5. Learn an extra language if required to migrate to country of choice. 


There are many, many,many, many Singaporean nurses that are now in Canada, Australia, Europe, etc,etc. (Singaporean nurses are severely underpaid) Obviously if you are migrating to another country, the advantage will be to learn the languages of the country. Gives your Citizenship chances a boost.

Everything in nursing can be considered as ""free"" if you are willing to sign the bond. Of course the country of your choice would prefer a younger nurse than older one. So you have to weigh the benefits/cons yourself.  

The final hidden advantage of being a nurse is SIA has a strong preference for ex-nurses :)

From there, get that A level or poly diploma, and if you want, go study abroad.

Once you are out the door, and you got some money to support yourself, apply for Permanent Residency, and find a job in the mean time to get sponsorship (this is the tough part).

However, I've seen my friends who are from Korea that have successfully gotten PR card while working menial hourly wage jobs.

Where there's a will, there's a way! Lot of young Koreans are leaving Korea, and even going as far as Germany to become auto mechanics. I'd say that such solutions also exist for Singaporeans and any other country.

7aqein,dpdbjjj,"Is there something that you are aware of that prevented you from initiating and maintaining friendships? I saw that no one had mentioned this yet, and feel is a valid point to ponder.

I don't have many friends too, but for those few handful that I have, I put in quite a bit of efforts to talk, text, go out and eat although I am awkward penguin irl, etc. I think these helped retain the small but OK social circle that I have.

Apart from hardcore gaming/browsing internet, is there any interest that you may have? Interests are quite good places to start seeking for motivations and friends/acquaintances in my opinion.

I developed a strong interest in brewing my own coffee as an alternative to instant coffees and $1.10 local coffee drinks. Have the luxury of able to brew with my own apparatus at work, and found that I attracted some people to communicate with me especially those who share similar interests with me (coffee). I think it helped me get going at work to fill my social void as I am very shy to initiate talks on my own, and take a while to get comfortable with strangers. There are days I simply look forward to my next cup of coffee. 

The reason why I skipped online related interest, is because I think since you've found that those friendships you tried building online behind monitor screens don't last, why not give alternative options a try?

Saying so, I am willing to be a listening ear if you need one. Gamed heavily and lost a lot of social aspects of my life while growing up. Finally able to gradually kick the gaming habit due to work. I still game, but less and no longer hardcore. Drop a PM if need.

However, the more pressing problem of finding new friends is a tricky one. From what I gather, most people you like to befriend would most likely reached their ‘quota’. If you didn’t catch them early, unless some specific circumstance arise, you probably have no chance of. We missed out, that’s that. I can think of no solutions, except for you to just keep trying. Step out more, join a social club, try to meet new people irl and see how it goes. 

Contrary to the notion of you can make digital friends, I highly doubt it. I think humans need physical closeness as a precursor to psychological closeness. 

Side note: For myself, aside from battling with the crippling feeling of loneliness, I occasionally get the courage to upgrade myself, physically-do some exercise, or learn skills that maybe useful in the future. Frankly, if you really step on the path of self-improvement, there’s not much time to spare thinking about how to combat loneliness... well until your old friend (darkness) comes to chat with you again ",2,UncivilisedMonkey,2017-11-05 18:22:02,7aqein

Not too long ago my employer sent out a bulk mail advising everyone to use up their carry-over vacation balance within 30 days or forfeit the balance.  The email explicitly stated not to approach our Project Managers for a deferral because they could not override HR.

I scrambled to find a suitable trip and found two holiday packages (non refundable).  Unfortunately when I approached my Project Manager for leave approval he rejected it because ""we were too busy"".  When I pointed out that we were under instructions to use our leave immediately, and that I had booked non-refundable trips he told me that it was my risk for booking trips without seeking approval first.

I thought about it for a couple of days then sent an email to the HR Manager, and Project Manager outlining the brief history of this issue and advised them that as a contractor I believed the management practices they were executing were unfair to employees and that I no longer wished to be a member of their team.

After a few panicked emails and phone calls they compensated me for one trip and allowed me to take the 2nd.  So happy ending (this time).

But I pity employees in SG who are not in my situation and cannot easily push back against their employers when they act unfairly.

As a result, they expect us to do 2-3x more work than our peers in Manila, ignoring the fact that Manila has random holidays (Today is a holiday for them) and that the quality of work is pretty shoddy. Also, their wages have been rising by quite a bit since a lot of MNCs moved their call centers/shared service centers to Manila.

Add this in to poor bosses who believe that they pay you to work, not to life, and you will end up with poor morale, high turnovers and lazy staff (If I am expected to do 1 hour of OT a day, expect me to reddit 25% more a day).

Of course, the bosses won't see it as their fault, even if  exit interviews show that a lot of people are leaving because there isn't any work life balance.

Which Phrase in the army are you at now? 

For the first 6 months I struggle in army too. Like you I can't seem to find my place in the army.

Mostly I contribute it to the change of environment. Living with military rules I felt confined and awkward.

I also kept hearing ""2 years only, suck it up and move on"" and I understand that don't help at all.

How it got better is when I changed my perspective. Instead of being overwhelm by the environment, I distract myself with thoughts of planning for my future. I find small pockets of time to plan what school or work am I going to do. Then find out what it takes to move towards that objective.

I told myself that all my peers are stuck in the army too, I can gain an advantage by thinking and working on my objectives.

Worrying and feeling frustrated I realised only trapped me in the present and the more I kept thinking of ""The 2 years in army"" the more frustrated I become.

If you fear the army MOs being dismissive and refuse to refer you for specialist diagnosis, then seek to get diagnosed outside first – at a public hospital preferably, for credibility – and take the specialist letter to MO for appropriate escalation. They won't ignore a letter from a public hospital's psychiatrist. If you're diagnosed with depression and not just an adjustment disorder, chances are you'll be down PES; if your condition is severe enough to warrant C9-E9, you'll be around others with similar issues as you at work, so the stigma isn't that bad here. 

Don't be scared by the classic fearmongering tactics.

Don't worry about your friends and dad. Mental health is still not very important here in Singapore and some people don't understand it because they don't have said issues (so they look at it from an ultra-rational point of view). 

I don't know how it is in your unit, but everyone says that the person on mc is chao keng, and you shouldn't think too much of it. More importantly, does it matter? Malingering is what they call lying about your health, and you obviously (from what you're telling us) have an issue. This is your mental health at stake, and if they still think so after you are *diagnosed* and *going for treatment*, then you should be dropping them like a hot pocket.

From personal experience, you'll be sent to MMI for a psychiatric evaluation (you will need to bring a relative along), possibly committed to an observation ward. Then after that comes regular visits to the psychiatrist, as well as counseling sessions at CMPB. This is maybe once every few months for the former, and about once a month for the latter.

One thing however, if you're already seeing a doctor for any issues, maybe you can ask for a referral to a psychologist from the hospital first, because while your problem may be legitimate, sometimes MOs don't give a fuck.

5020jx,d70x265,"I can empathize with how you feel: I have someone really close to me who went through the same thing, and the process of helping him get through it almost ate me alive as well.

The first step is to accept that this is your new reality, and you will have to work your life around this new sudden confinement.

When people say suck it up, it does not means you just take it and live life for army. You have to plan to live your life **around** army. This means that although your life becomes a routine due to the regimental lifestyle, you need to find ways and things to add some rhythm to your life. Think back about your former self. What activities or hobbies did you engage in that kept you happy? If these past activities are no longer possible, then do something new. Read a book, pick up a new skill or volunteer at a dog shelter. You need to find something to do when you're not in camp that helps resembles some form of ""normal"" civilian lifestyle. Do not let army take over your life.

It is important to have friends to hang out with during your downtime (time outside of army). You mentioned that you pushed away your friends due to issues resulting from army. You're doing yourself a disfavor and being unfair to your friends. They are not responsible for incapability to transit to an army lifestyle, so try not to lash out at them. If it is due to their inability to empathize with your difficulties to army life, then unfortunately, majority are unable to comprehend problems related to mental health, as most Singaporeans have issues understanding something so intangible. This is something you will have to accept and cope with. Keep your friends with you. They can help you adjust to your new life by providing familiarity, but forgive them if they are unable to understand your problem. Do not continue engaging them in your problems if they do not genuinely try to understand your difficulties in army. You will only get more frustrated in trying to break the wall, beginning a vicious cycle of anger which may result further alienating your friends.

Ultimately, you will have to accept your life is changed for these 2 years, and plan to live around it, rather than lamenting in it. Always have activities planned during your downtime. Do not give yourself time to think and lament. If someone is unable to understand your problems and casually brush it off, do not take offense. It is hard to find someone who can really take the time and effort to help you through this difficult period, so understand that the road in these two years could be hard and lonely but you need to take charge of it. If you really need to talk to someone, please find someone professional who can at least empathize with your problems. It is alot more productive and less frustrating.

Good luck, these two years might look long, but once you hold control over your life now, you will find it flash by. You will also find yourself more resilient as a person when you go on your future endeavors. ",2,jaemian,2016-08-29 22:26:56,5020jx
5020jx,d71ta65,"I personally went through depression when I was in the army. I want you to understand that this is only a temporary setback. It might not seem like at the moment but this will go away. Things are not as bad as it seems. But I need you to take some steps to help yourself. This is very important.

1) This weekend or whenever you book out. Please walk into IMH at Buangkok. There's no shame in seeking help. The people there are very helpful and understanding. Tell the doctor everything honestly. They will prescribe you the right medication. But you must take this step. If you are feeling ashamed or guilty of your condition, Do Not Think That. Depression is the flu of the mental illness and it's more common than you think. 

2) In IMH, the doctor might give you a medical cert or letter specifying about the situation. Please take this and give it to your commanders or MO. Again people are more understanding than you realise. You are not the first person in NS having depression. 

3) Book an appointment with a psychologist. This is just a fancy term for a friend and a listening ear. But this is no less an important step. You can ask the psychiatrist (doctor) to help you book that IMH. Or in some neighborhoods they have Family Service centers. Go to the site and book an appointment. They are quite good with timing so you can book a session in the evening. 

https://app.msf.gov.sg/Policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Family-Service-Centres

4) Please take of care of yourself. Please start to be disciplined about certain things if you already are not. Make sure you take your food at the right time. Do not skip your meals or showers and make sure you get enough sleep. I know this is NS and things might not go your way but it's important that you set a routine whenever possible. Do not procrastinate. 

5) Finally this will take some time to heal but it will heal. I need you to have a zero fuck attitude towards certain things. Stop caring about what people will think. What they think is none of your business. That's their problem. They can call you whatever. I had an asshole officer laugh at my condition, I just laughed along. That's just way things are. Your job is not to change them but better yoursf. Just go about doing your stuff. Do your NS duties diligently and religiously. This will help you focus and take your mind off self pity. Talk to people, make friends. See the humour in everyday stuff. Laugh it off. Someday you will look back at this as an achievement. 

It might not seem like it is but this is an opportunity. An opportunity to better yourself. You are a very valuable member of our society. We all care about you. You are important to your parents. You are important to all of us. You are doing a very important job.

After spending a few months at his new posting and was supposed to have ""recovered"" and resumed his original duties, his commander put in a report with some embellishment saying his was still under a lot of stress. He was able to stay at his new posting until ORD.

So it may not be the case that all people with depression are treated without compassion.

I'm no doctor but I do have some familiarity with depression and you seemed depressed to me. Regardless of your army situation I strongly advise you to speak with a doctor. If you don't want to see an MO then go to a polyclinic and see a GP.

Are you getting bullied? Discriminated? Persecuted? What is your 'problem' and 'issues' exactly? Depression is an easy 'blanket statment'. Since before army you do not have depression, what aspect of army life triggered this 'depression'? You should at least know about these things right?

It certainly cannot be obtained by the public. Secondly, every embarrassing medical issue you told your doctor is recorded. Did you really think twice before telling your doctor in those cases?

According to the doctor at MMI, the records are accessible by anyone from the civil service, so it does follow you to a certain extent. Moreover, if a future employer asks you to declare any previous medical conditions and you do not declare your depression, he has grounds to fire you and you have no recourse. The law for employees is pretty weak in this regard.

If you do see a doctor for depression, what you want to aim for when talking to the doctor at MMI is ""adjustment disorder"", this just signifies that you have problems adjusting to a military lifestyle and allows your superiors to do something about it with something black and white. It does not leave a mark on your records.",3,jaemian,2016-08-29 21:48:33,d70tyaq

I've experienced a startup that is somewhat similar. When it comes to bosses attitude on things. When you place money instead of the well being of your employees first as a startup, you're doing it wrong. Money is important but the important thing about start ups is that they need to grow.

You will meet horrible bosses and fantastic ones. It's the same everywhere, really. I've read/heard similar tales from people in China, USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Germany, Uruguay. It's not a Singapore thing.

I suppose the F&B industry is a lot worse off because smaller restaurants/cafes have to make ends meet. Also, the culture here is horrible for part-timers - little benefits and accountability.

I can assure you that things *generally* get better once you're a full-time professional.

On the opposite side of the spectrum I've also worked in blue-collar type jobs like housekeeping, where managers exploit their manpower, shout and curse at staff for minor mistakes and regularly schedule them for many many hours of unpaid overtime as punishment. 

I've also worked in pyramid schemes that often perpetuate the idea of ""get rich without going to school!!!"" that has really only worked for people at the top of the pyramid. These jobs are all definitely there, but there's more disadvantages to them then just a meagre salary.

Hi, I have problems with my English. I can't write or speak well. I graduated in 2012 and found an engineering job in 2013. After a year, I was depressed, could not sleep well and felt upset that I could not finish my work on time. I could not construct proper sentences for replying emails, writing reports and creating presentations. I started to stay at home every weekend and disliked talking with others. Recently, I quit my job and found a new one as a technician. I feel that I am very useless, as I have a degree but am doing the work of a technician. I feel sad most of the time. I try to make an effort to read something new everyday, but I just can't do it and feel like playing games instead. I don't know how to help myself. I also cannot express myself well. Can anyone help me? There is no one I can talk to. My husband can't help me as well.

Hey there. Am a fellow retainee here that graduated 2 years back. What I shall do is to try to share with you my experience and some tips that helped me through. 

You ask what should your next course of action be. In the short term you should probably focus on your pw, if I recall correctly the after promos period is the final leg of pw submission, so work hard w your group mates on that! Try to get a good result for pw, since it's going to reflect on your cert and it's one subject you won't have to worry about anymore afterwards. It's going to be hard, but until you get your results there's not much point worrying too much about your promo results, try to shelf away the sadness and focus on pw first. 

Like I said, not easy, but you gotta try. 

Subsequently when you receive your results and if you find out that you are retaining, it will suck, no bullshitting you there. I'm a guy and I cried by eyes out at home secretly. It's ok to feel sad but it's more important to pick yourself up. 

""Why do we fall? So we may learn to pick ourselves up"" 

Yes, Batman, but this quote made me believe that my retaining could be a good thing in disguise, if I look past all the negatives, and more importantly if I work hard to make it so. 

Several things you gotta do to do better next year
Identify why you got poor grades this year, was it a distraction, was it poor study techniques, was it plain laziness? Identify your factors and change it. Mine was a combination of cca and an addiction to computer gaming, and after I retained it was a huge wake up call, I quit computer gaming for my remaining years in Jc and I worked w my cca teacher, if I don't finish my work, I won't get to take part in my cca. 

It is also important to pay attention in lectures, and complete your tutorials. I used to just sleep through lectures and not do my tutorials, but minimally you should at least fill in your notes during lectures and finish your tutorials for class. If home is unproductive, try to finish your work before heading home each day. It helps in your second year that you no longer take pw and have that few extra hours to do your work while your new peers are in pw lessons. 

Next, on coping w the social pressure, friends etc. honestly, I think retainees judge themselves more than anybody else judge them. Yes I have met some teachers that truly believe retainees are scum (but that just made me more resilient in proving them wrong), but honestly your friends don't care and your new peers won't too. You just got to believe that. 

At the end of the day, an extra year is nothing. At age 18+, it might seem like the end of the world, but in the real world no one really cares that you're one year older with an A level cert. it's more important to get your good grades, and make this year worth it. 

Personally, I believe retaining allowed me to achieve decent grades that I wouldn't have been able to get if I promoted, due to a weak foundation etc. I have had fellow struggling friends that promoted while I retained, and yeah they went ahead to finish their Jc in 2 years but sadly couldn't achieve the results they wanted.

Feel free to Pm me if you need any more help, but jia you OP, it's definitely not the end of the world, many like myself have walked this path. (: ",18,Jhocx,2016-09-27 05:49:41,54jntb

When get back to school next year, keep an open mind. Make new friends- they'll be important to you in the time to come.

You can also ask your friends in J2 for advice (that's what I did and it helped me a lot). 

While you may think that it's a year wasted, trust me, you'll still be better off than advancing to J2 and having no idea what's going on. This one year will help you build a proper foundation so once you go into J2, you'll have an easier time and can focus less on the J1 topics

* Learn to shut out your parents and live off them with free rent till you have earn enough money

* Find a job, but in Singapore you might not have alot of money to take back after rent,bills,food and many others

* Sign on, free housing and good pay

Since you suggested that moving out is a ""must-do"" I would suggest you start saving now and I hope you realise how much you might have to fork out for your own place. A quick search I did and most 1 rooms come out to about $800. Poly grad earn max 1.7 ""give you the best chance"" $1700- $800(rent)-$350(food)-$100 (bills) = $450.

31m4q8,cq4yqsy,"Hi OP,

As much as I would love to tell you to sign on like everyone else , I don't think they will accept you because of your mental issues. But give it a go if you really consider doing it, 

Pros of signing on
- They feed you with everything you need.
- you can even earn extras over the weekends.
(current NSFs and NSmen will know what i mean)
- Pay is fucking good.

Cons
- you'll practically lose out on social life.
 Meaning if you don't have a girlfriend now, it'll be super duper difficult for you to find one, unless you're those kind that chiong every wednesday, friday - sunday, or actively searching for one now.

Those are my opinion if you want to sign on,

Another way you can deal with it is to face it head on, talk things out with your family. I don't know if it'll work for you, but as a middle kid in my family, I'll always feel that my parents are venting their anger on me because of my older siblings and my younger siblings are always getting pampered. Until one day I shouted at them how I really feel, things got better. 
I'm not asking you to shout at them, but try talking to them nicely, explain to them that you're emotionally hurt deeply and that you're also human, regardless whether you're adopted or not. 

Running away from home in Singapore is so damn not practical, simply because rents are so fucking high.
If you're seriously planning to run, try talking to some of your closer friends, if you have a girlfriend, try talking to her as well. I believe if you're good to your friends in poly, they won't watch you die, unless you're those kind of quite CB one, then i don't think anyone will want to help.

I got no choice haizz,I do not have money to go private poly because it is very expensive,secondly it is not recognize in companies when you apply for job in the future, I have managed to have a peace of mind until my father constantly started to mocked at me again and always looked down on me as usual. my parents almost everyday always finding fault with me because they see me always no happy but what can I do?and it make me temporary depressed at that time but not anymore as I have changed for the better and more motivated to better in life in the future.

1. Start saving up to get the necessities (a cheapo laptop for job hunting, office wears, etc) OR negotiate with your family to get a few thousands dollars as your kickstart fund for leaving the family (this means burning the bridge with them)
2. Find a job before you move out 
3. Move to somewhere nearer to your workplace to cut off travelling time
4. Share a room instead of paying for full rent, save at least 300$


Living in Singapore is actually not that expensive (for single and without any commitment), the biggest expenses will be from your accommodation and food. 


When you save enough, take up a degree or get certified to be tradesman (if you are handy). When there's a will, there's a way.

Everything will pass. Finding a hobby or something to do is really important. It sucks now, but embrace the suck. It sounds stupid I know, but every time you feel down, use that to motivate yourself. Prove them wrong. I remember at the end of sec 2, I felt like a failure. So many things I wanted to do, I couldn't because my grades sucked. I felt like a failure, why does everyone else have it easier than me?

I felt surrounded by people but alone at the same time. Don't worry about how people view you, they probably don't even notice. When you go to a mall, you probably didn't notice other people. So why would they notice you?

If you're getting bullied, please tell a teacher or your parents. I read that your parents treat you like you're 4. That's normal.

Normally, I find that social anxiety is caused by insecurity.Is it with your weight? Because that was the case for me. So I decided to stop lazing around and get over it. I lost weight, and I'm feeling better than before. If anyone ever looks down on you, prove them wrong. Set a goal, and keep pushing towards it. Don't stop going till you succeed.

My advise to you, join more CCAs, make it a habit to adopt a healthy lifestyle (sleep early and excercise) and just talk to people. Well maybe not random strangers on trains but the person seating at the desk beside you or infront of you. Ask them about their weekend and what they did and just listen.

When I'm with friends, it becomes another thing. There is this.. unseen peer pressure, both positive and negative effects.

Which will cause conversations among friends to be boring cause i was always making sure i dun offend them in any way.. It became more formal than fun which made me start to realize.. it was harder for me to find friends when i started to have that habit..

Of course, im not saying that being rude/insensitive is the way to go lOL.. but like when we say someone is our friend, we should be able to talk freely wif no restriction/compromise/no trouble to chat wif them.. rather than thinking should i say this? nahh will offend them etcetc.

And i understand, there will always be cliques in sec sch.. if some ppl are in neither, some may feel left out etc.. so as what other redditors recommend, volunteer, meet new ppl. Friends doesnt have to be those among ur age.. Or do not think that u need a group of friends.. instead having 1 close friend is the best. 

Or find a hobby, search for ppl who does it too. maybe ur not-yet friend is interested too but dk yet nia hahah.

I didnt ignore him lr anything but I didnt exactly make friends with him either.

I cant say for sure whats the problem, because only people around you would know. Whether or not someone will tell you, thats another thing. Of course, if you arent interested in making friends, none of the above would matter.

However, if you really want to make friends casually in school, you have to realise its not just about being nice. You have to be ""inviting to talk to"" as well.

>I'm really fine, it's just benzos and all after all. I have many 420-friendly people around me and we do just fine, but I'm just afraid of the people who are perhaps addicted to opiates and the such, and really do need help but are totally ignored. It's unfortunate that we view these people as the perpetrators instead of victims, so fuck that mentality.  
Such a mentality is akin to being born with cerebral palsy and getting mocked at, ""Eh, you got palsy you deserve it lah fuck off"". I have to use such an extreme example because it is exactly what addiction is like, it's like cerebral palsy or related afflictions, they're something we really cannot control.  
So to those mightier than thou people here, the next time you're doing volunteer work and meet people who are perhaps mentally stunted from birth or from age, we are the same. It's not something that we can consciously control. With the similar amount of love that you provide to the former group of people (and please do continue showering your love to them), that same amount or less of that love towards us may make more of a difference than you imagine.  
Unfortunately, this is Singapore, and it is much easier to shun drug users than to understand and help them.
I do hope that one day Singapore will be tolerant towards us, and realise that it's an affliction that we do not want, and help us instead of treating us like the leper that we are not. Having one's psyche messed up by drugs is bad enough, you do not want to affect said person's psyche while they are sober.  
So, if you know of anyone in a similar situation, do offer to help, do offer to lend a listening ear, do offer to be there. It'll make a whole world of difference. Inaction on a friend's/relative's/lover's part would constitute as much fault as the drug addict harming oneself. Many a times we just need someone to talk to, and we can temporarily pass on our cravings for whatever drug we're hooked on to.  
Here's to a more open and understanding community :)

Copied my reply to it here:

>Being *born* with a condition and making the *choice* to consume those kind of drugs are very different things. Yes, you cannot (or rather it's incredibly difficult to) control your addiction, but what got you addicted in the first place was your *choice*. So please, PLEASE, stop having that **victim mentality**, because if you keep thinking that you're the **victim** and that you need other people to help you out of the hole you dug yourself in, how then will you take full responsibility of your predicament and realize that ultimately you have to want to help yourself? Only when you put the onus on yourself to kick the addiction can other people help you the most effectively.  
So, I'm telling you to tell yourself to fuck that victim mentality of yours. I'm pretty sure things will get better after that and I hope you share my optimism :)

> SINGAPORE - Unable to move on after their affair ended early this year, a married man killed his former girlfriend in her flat before jumping to his death from the 10th-storey unit, a court heard on Tuesday (Dec 19).

> Safety supervisor Chng Hong Nam, 49, was found dead at the foot of the block of flats at around 11pm on May 29. When police officers went up to Ms Serinn Tan Bee Leng&apos;s home at Block 520A, Tampines Central 8, they saw the sales telemarketer lying motionless on a blood-soaked bed.

> In an inquiry into their deaths, Senior Investigation Officer Vicneswaran Ramakrishnan told the court that Ms Tan, 46, died from a stab wound in her chest and two in her abdomen.

> She also had cuts on her forearms, believed to be defensive wounds when Mr Chng attacked her with a ""knife-like weapon"". The weapon used to kill her has not been recovered.

> The father of three first met Ms Tan about four years ago when he was working as a property agent.

> They got involved in a relationship and tried to keep it discreet, but Mr Chng&apos;s wife later found out about it.

> She asked her husband to stop seeing Ms Tan and even went to the divorcee&apos;s flat to confront her. When confronted, Ms Tan denied that she was in a relationship with Mr Chng.

> On Tuesday, SIO Vicneswaran told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that the affair ended early this year, and Ms Tan got into a relationship with another married man, who was her supervisor at work.

> Despite this, Mr Chng still contacted Ms Tan as he wanted to meet her, but she always made excuses to avoid him.

> The pair agreed to meet at her Tampines home on May 29 and Mr Chng later jumped to his death after stabbing her.

> Residents alerted the police, and officers who found Ms Tan&apos;s NRIC in Mr Chng&apos;s possession went up to her flat. They found her lying face up on a bed, with stab wounds, as well as bruises around her wrists and ankles.

> SIO Vicneswaran said Mr Chng could have restrained the woman with some cable ties, as they were found at the foot of the block.

> Neighbours the officers spoke to said they did not hear any suspicious sounds coming from the unit that evening.

> SIO Vicneswaran said this was because Mr Chng, who was bigger in built than Ms Tan, could have gagged his former girlfriend before stabbing her.

> He added that Mr Chng sent a message to his wife and jumped off the 10th-storey balcony.

> In the message, read out in court on Tuesday, Mr Chng apologised to his family members and stated that he was ""not a good father"".

> Ms Tan&apos;s sister and parents were in court, but they declined to comment when approached by The Straits Times. The coroner will give her findings on Jan 19 next year.

You are undermining the murdered party's situation here simply because they've been murdered, and therefore aren't around to experience the aftermath of things anymore. 

You can't measure murder as simply a life lost, and a person no longer around to experience the realization of that. You have to factor in the magnitude of every experience the person otherwise would've had. You steal all of that from someone when you end their life. You extinguish all the potential they had to live for and you also kill everyone else whom that person might have become. Every past experience that person ever had, any life lessons they learnt, any aspirations they held, all of that invalidated and gone in an instant. There is an intangible but *immense* gravity to that.

It's distasteful to downplay the act of snuffing the life and light out of a human being simply because said person might not be around anymore to *feel* murdered.

The difference is huge. It is important for society to help people who choose suicide if the cause is emotional and temporary. We can help them back on their feet so they will not choose to kill themselves.

However, in the case of Euthanasia, the cause is both logical and permanent. If there is no way we can stop their suffering, should we not help them if they choose death as the way for them to end their suffering?

Yes, her opinion should be automatically invalidated because of her age. I like how some people here think.

[The original ST article on this issue](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/number-of-suicides-among-seniors-hits-record-high) simply pointed out a trend in rising elderly suicides. [The follow up article](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/973kx7/multiple_reasons_behind_elder_suicides/e457xcy/) mentions depression, a lack of social support, physical illness, financial problems, fear of becoming a burden, social disconnection and a lack of knowledge of avenues of help as possible reasons for the trend. Nowhere was euthanasia or terminally ill patients mentioned.

Until [this joker's letter](https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/consider-legalising-euthanasia) appeared. He addresses the original ST article with his example of ""a senior in his 70s or 80s who is poor and has advanced cancer."" This person, should he die, will not be counted as a suicide case because he died to an illness. The example is not relevant to the trend of elderly suicides at all.

Rachel's main point is that euthanasia should not be made available as a solution to the problems mentioned in the original 2 ST articles. The causes behind the rise in elderly suicides must be dealt with instead. The irrelevant side point on terminally ill patients should not be there at all, but she wrote it in because it was mentioned in the previous letter.",-10,dragonth20,2018-08-15 23:08:39,97epc8

Do Patients decide? Then how we do ascertain if the patient is in the right state/clarity of mind to make the decision? And what happens in a situation where the fatal dose is administered and the patient has a sudden change of mind? In this situation is the physician culpable for manslaughter? Are legal waivers valid in this situation? Could this be misused?

Do Family members decide, if the patient is incapacitated? How do we ascertain this is not misused, and in the patient’s best interest? What’s the legal angle to this, and do we relook at the AMD?

Inclusion of waiting periods and two certifying doctors to a council + psychiatrist involvement seems to be the only way to safeguard vulnerable people. People still have the choice but they will need to fulfill criteria to be eligible is the best compromise for less abuse.

Imagine having terminal stage cancer. The tumour(s) is/are pressing against your bones and nerves and you’re in constant pain. On top of that, chemo has made you bald, and you throw up every hour or so. 

Now that’s just a baseline example. Some of these people would prefer putting their affairs in order and moving on peacefully.

With DNR, you are simply allowed to die by natural means without being given a trial of resuscitation after cardiac arrest. Often times this is offered when it is felt that resuscitation after cardiac arrest would simply prolong suffering without a reasonable expectation of recovering, or result in an unacceptable quality of life thereafter. But to die by DNR, you need to have a disease for which the natural course is death.

That does not happen in euthanasia. You can be a lot less sick, you can be perfectly healthy aside from a sick mind, and still die by euthanasia.

That’s just the difference in standards of how “sick” a person has to be, which is close to a measure of how irreversible a disease process has to be, before one is allowed to die.

Using my parents as an example, I always take them for granted. People do care for each other, but they don't express it in such a way to make you feel it.

You have to be the most reliable friend to yourself because you know your condition best and how to be happy about life.

It's not about you doing well or doing badly, in our age where everyone is middle class, every other person has his own problems to deal with. Nothing personal and nothing about you in most cases.

The quote you are talking about is a standard cautionary quote about the avoidance of false friends in times of your success, and one of the ways to do it is not to brag about your success (you've shown yourself to be capable, surely you can handle getting stuck in the snow on your own?). 

If you do need help - ask only from the ones you trust - and ask once and once only. There is nothing personal about being refused. This includes family: Don't take your bro personally, you simply aren't fully incapacitated yet to be urgent enough to drop what he's doing at the moment. 

(Also, life choices. No one is going to help you make or support poor ones, guaranteed, unless you are family - in which case it is their interest to get you to stop hurting yourself as you are hurting them through it.)",83,A-Chicken,2018-09-05 20:01:17,9d2isl

Every relationship is transactional whether you want to believe it or find it false. We talk to someone because they have certain qualities and if you became shit, you most likely lose that quality thus making no one care. This is how human nature works. ",55,Shinryu_,2018-09-05 20:13:23,9d2isl

9d2isl,e5f6u23,"Yeah, I realized this growing up. It’s better to know everything and depend on yourself. Always ask for help but at the same time be independent so when there’s nobody there for you, you can stay strong and pick yourself up.

I still believe if you’ve helped someone through a similar tough time, they will return the favour because they understand the situation better. Unless they’re a selfish asshole or having major problems of their own.

Also, it’s not that people don’t care, they just don’t understand how serious the situation is and since it affects you and not them, it’s perceived as “not that bad” on the alert scale.

Since suicide is illegal, we just gotta live, and since that’s the only choice, might as well make the best of it for yourself. You gotta create the life that you want. Definitely, you can’t expect circumstance or people to always turn in your favour but you can chart your course to betterment through constant trial and error. For instance now you have this awakening that those friends during good times aren’t true friends and that you cant always take for granted that people you think you can count on will be there for you. Life is about the survival of the fitness. Those who forge the most relationships, step on the most people, and force their way through life most aggressively within legal boundaries get ahead more than those who passively sit and do the minimal. Perhaps by aggressively seeking out more friends and forging more relationships you can eliminate those which do not benefit you and keep those that do. ",16,fauxVision,2018-09-05 20:27:18,9d2isl

If she were stuck in jail, she'd call up an old friend from secondary school knowing they have her back. At this point she's practically Singaporean and has an extensive social circle here from work and volunteering. Still, not a single person she'd trust to bail her out of tough situations.

It's totally understandable why you are feeling blue now. The money situation, feeling unwell physically, and you are not living with a loved one who can accompany you to the clinic. It's ok to feel this way.

That being said, I believe you'll get out of this state soon enough. Life fluctuates, having a down means you'll get a up too.

If you really yearn for a life where you have several people who really cares for you, you have to be that kind of person who genuinely attracts those type of people. It takes continual effort on your part, it doesn't appear out of the blue.

You need to really put yourself out there and get to know many people, select those you click with, then take time to bond, be there for them (otherwise it won't be fair right?), and continually touch base with them etc. Yes, you will meet many transactional 'friends' or people who don't reciprocate. This is why you need to learn how to be a good judge of character, of others (filter them out!) and also yourself (ensure you are giving joy to others too). It's a two-way street. 

Balance is the key. You can be somewhat independent, yet comfortable enough to ask for help and emotional support when needed.

we stay together with friends and family because we have a good time with each other and support each other.  the distinction between what we call genuine and transactional may lie in the nature of what we receive - tangible vs intangible. why ""transactional"" sounds sucky may be because in such a relationship, what both wants from each other are purely material things, and all emotions are disregarded. and well, humans crave validation and self-actualization, so it hurts to be reduced to mere objects. when we're dealing with intangible matters, our feelings and sense of self gets validated. that's probably why we don't mind relationships even though we just want the other person to make you happy or just want to make the other person happy to feel good about ourselves.

Maybe the people around you do care, but you just don't know it. You have to make it known to the people who care about you the severity of your situation and that you need their help. Your brother probably felt it wasn't so serious that he should stop whatever he's doing to help you. Perhaps he would've come to help if he thought you couldn't handle it on your own. And about your friends, maybe some of them would've offered help if you called them?

9d2isl,e5h6vcy,"You feel like this because A) you live in Singapore and B) your narrow social circle subscribes to that culture.

In Singapore, a man dying on the street will be ignored or at best, filmed to submit to Stomp. If he's lucky, a foreigner will be on hand to help him. This story has come up again and again locally. Read about a volunteer - yup, it's a foreign citizen. Always.

In *some* other countries, strangers literally give up their lives to help others. You can read about tragedies like school shootings, where teachers and even students, yes CHILDREN, die protecting other students. Such difficult events, thankfully, don't take place often, but they reveal the truth of character. Not everyone's like that. But more widespread offshoots of this same fundamental character shine through in positive circumstances like charity and friendship.

/u/LunarBlessings is correct but his heart is broken. That's exactly what you find all over Singapore. Let's dodge the difficult, meaningful discussions by distracting ourselves with technicalities. We're technically right. We follow the letter of the law, but not the spirit. Let's type mountains of text discussing technical minutiae and not spend a single word addressing the emotional state of /u/fool168. *clap* *clap* *clap* Did you need proof of Singapore's cultural woes? Exhibit A: done, right here.

So what if practically all altruism is transactional at a pedantic level? WHAT DO YOU DO? Do you help those less fortunate than you? Would you take a sick friend to the clinic, even if it's inconvenient? Would you cancel your date with a girl because your brother had a bad fight with your parents and needs a talk?

OP: Genuine friends are rarer than gold and more precious than diamonds. It's a cliche, but true, and applies to finding a girl/boy of your dreams too.

If you want to find them, you have to dig. It's hard work. It will take a long time. You'll get a lot of mud, coal, and shit. But if you find one, even one, it's worth it all.

How to dig? Another true cliche. To make friends, be a friend. Be the person you want others to be.

Here's the tricky part that people don't talk about. You can't change other people. You're searching for those who are likeminded. That means you'll have to cut out people from your life who only want to use you for your wallet, body, or some other triviality. You need to read people, to understand what they are like in truth, not just when they are happy and well-fed emotionally.

Give everyone a chance, maybe two. You will be hurt, but don't let them hurt you more than twice. People who take advantage of you without giving anything in return are not worth your time. Keep them at a distance, and keep searching for true friendship. Keep being a friend to others. It's like finding a girlfriend. If no one around you fits, join new communities. (Warning: do NOT join a cult!) Shake up your social scene. Do you hang out with engineers? Try hanging out with artists. Or vice versa. Try hanging out with older people. Younger people. Participate in making your community better. Volunteer.

OP: You are right. You have only yourself to depend on. Isn't that wonderful? Your current deadbeat ""friends"" - THEY DON'T MATTER. You can go and find real friends, make your life better. It's all on YOU. If you choose, you can have a wonderful life for yourself, surrounded by wonderful people. Have an awesome day.

9d2isl,e5h8r5s,"I do not understand your points fully. I will just try my best to address what i think i know. 

Singaporeans certainly do not ignore a dying man on the road. 1 or 2 cases that goes on television or stomp does not count and neither do they negate the other cases of people helping each other that dont get on stomp.

Strangers risking their lives to help one another. The points i have made so far addresses this. It definitely does not water down their heroic actions. 

You give me the impression that you think i am attacking them. I am certainly not targeting people who help others.

Discussing the minor details was never meant as a distraction. I do not understand why when you were pretty straightforward in your points so far, suddenly decide to swerve into sarcasm territory. My point has always been “If you want to receive help and EXPECT to receive said help, make sure you have helped others. Else you absolutely do not deserve to get pissed or upset when you don’t receive help. In the event if you do receive help from a stranger, give them a thanks or whatever so they can feel good about it and everyone wins. The cycle continues.”. My target audience was never to people who have figured it out but to people who are absolutely trash and cant seem to understand why they have no friends.

Whether OP has done so or not i do not know and have stated so. My original comment was to u/sageadam. It was never meant for OP but if he finds something in my words then good for him. If he got fucked multiple times by friends who sucks, im not the comforting kind. On the other hand, I’ve seen friends who were in OP situations and usually they are shit friends you don’t want to be with. Again, not attacking OP.

Have i helped my friends even in times on inconvenience? Yes.
Did they help me when i asked for it? Yes. Of course there are those that dont but those are people you cut off or reduce resources to.

I agree with your other points to OP. If you want friends, you have to put in effort :)",4,LunarBlessings,2018-09-06 20:45:47,e5h6vcy
9d2isl,e5had28,"I actually know many Singaporeans who rush to help strangers. Sometimes I do so myself (although I frequently succumb to Bystander Effect). Maybe I'm rare case but I actually have this kind of positive social circle. 

It feels really good to help others. I feel useful, accomplished, like an agent of goodness. I feel like I have lived up to humanity's ideal of being a good neighbour. Thats the emotional value of helping. 

This kind of value can be subtle, and not something you consciously calculate before helping. 

Again I stress that theres nothing wrong with all of this. We should help as much as we can, and savour the good feeling. 

Also, maybe, i'm just talking a load of crap. Hahaha. Please feel free to disagree with my opinions. ",2,Kwaychup,2018-09-06 21:25:06,e5h6vcy
9d2isl,e5f42yn,"People love to believe theres true altruism. But of course it doesn’t exist. People help others always to expect some sort of return. If there’s no return, they get upset. No “thank you” or any sort of response of gratitude? Then i don’t feel so good helping you. I might help you again but the chances are even lower.

But not everyone can accept this truth and hence will lie to themselves to convince themselves that they are “selfless”

Help goes both ways. You want to get help you must be willing to help others and invest equal time. Else end up like OP where I’m assuming he helped some friends and now they neglect him. Of course there are many other reasons but this is the most common one I’ve seen and heard.

If I'm going by if it's transactional if they just married, yes. When you are married, you are effectively telling everyone that your spouse is yours and no one is allowed to do anything to her except yourself.

I too firmly believe there isn't such a thing called true altruism, and my rationale behind that is exactly the same as yours which is that as long as people are expecting a response or feel better(even a little bit) after the act, that is a gain and thus not selflessness.
Hell, even the phrase of ""putting yourself in other people's shoes"" which is intended to educate people being more considerate, is also asking that said person to think what would happen to him/her if they were caught up in a bad situation.(thus thinking about themselves and not others)
I've pointed out this to many people when we talked about this topic and in return they've always asked me the same question. Then what would be an example of true altruism to you then?

I've thought about it and since feelings/emotions are the main mechanism as to why true altruism does not exist, only then a non-sentient being(devoid of feelings/emotions) can be one. A being who does not feel/gain anything from performing an act of good will, that being will be selfless because it has no consciousnesses/feelings to feel good about itself after a ""Thank you"" or how people will see it in a positive light, or a mental pat on the back.

If its a 1 or 2 time thing it is extremely easy to shrug it off and continue your day feeling good about yourself even just a little. Try it 50 times or 100 times with the other person not responding. No gesture to show thanks, nothing at all. See if you will still feel the same. 

You do not give a friend a birthday present without looking for their response. No one puts a birthday gift at their friend’s doorsteps and no expect any form of response. 

Relationships/friendships are always transactional. It is not WRONG. It is the perfect way for both parties to be happy. You help me i help you has always worked. Those that commit less than the other will be the ones unhappy. 

Helping that stranger once or twice is nothing worth noting about if you are not in a hurry. Try helping someone when you are in a hurry only to see them ignore you afterwards. Do this 50 times and you will realize that you always want something in return. 

Edit: In response to your point on“.. being taken advantage by others ...”. That is a matter of your own character and whether you can detect if someone is a shit hole. Not everyone is a shit hole. People who are shit tend to display obvious characteristics. If it comes from a friend who you trust a lot then you will have to prepare to not be stepped on next time.

Given a situation where friends enter into a communal relationship and Friend A helps to comfort Friend B to relieve some emotional stress. Some people will say Friend A did it without expecting anything in return, in which case that'll be Friend B comforting Friend A back. Friend A is still doing it because of social obligation/responsibility to his friend B, because Friend A knows that since they are friends for so long, he/she has to comfort Friend B. That obligation/responsibility is the same as what a person would do for his/her family, so that he/she won't feel bad by being seen in a bad light if he/she chooses to neglect their family(This can be applied to the friend example as well).

With transactional relationships, you'd be more concerned with keeping track of how much you've given and received in a relationship because you wouldn't want a situation where you're giving more than you're receiving back or vice versa.

With communal relationships, you're purely concerned with the welfare of the other party without thinking about any benefits that an action brings you (even if it may benefit you). In a way, because communal relationships evolve from transactional ones, only transactional relationships that are deemed equitable by two parties would then progress into a communal one (both parties satisfied with how much they've given and received from the other). Although there's still giving and receiving in the communal relationship, you're not as concerned with keeping track of it. 

In your example, I don't think in a communal relationship, you'd worry about the fact that you'd be seen in a bad light if you didn't comfort your friend/family but rather you'd be concerned with the actual well-being of the person and wanting them to feel better.

It is very interesting to see the use of technical terms to properly classify how a relationship can progress into another status depending on equity of both parties.

With regards the example I gave, let's assume that it has nothing to do with being seen in a bad spotlight, more towards something like feeling good about himself/herself after comforting their friend. I personally feel that as long as we have feelings, there will always be a tiny part of us that feels good after doing something good, be it for a stranger or a close friend or even a family member. People generally deny that mental pat on the back by saying they do it for others' interest, but I disagree with that because if I were to put them in a situation where they did not help, they would probably feel like shit.

It doesn't help at all with the military regimentation and strict discipline, as well as NSFs being the punching bag for everything under the sun, even for mistakes that are no part of their own. NSFs have little power and always have to abide by orders from the higher ups.

The army and national service isn't made for everyone and not everyone can be bound by strict military regimentation and environment.

Many people have stated that in times of crisis, they would leave Singapore instead of defending it. So why force everyone to go through harsh training that disrupts their education/work life? Others wrote that people get punished because a single person does something wrong in their squadron. NS may break people beyond repair.

Essentially, depression and mental health issues are poorly-understood, especially considering the impact they have on our lives. So people who have problems don't know how to sound out, or feel that it is unsafe or unwise to do so. (And having depression makes it even harder to speak out anyway, due to its very nature.) A major disruption to a daily routine, such as joining national service (or getting a new job, or moving to a new country, or whatever) is often enough to bring everything out of balance. If the sufferer feels alone and isolated enough that they don't feel they can talk about their problems with anyone else, then suicide might seem like the path of least resistance.

Then SAF would also be pressured to provide a proper recap and followup of what led to the suicide of said minister's son.

Also, if you have authority, power and connections in the public sector in Singapore as a minister; you won't try to use that to pressure the organization on what caused your precious young son to commit suicide?
Those parents who have already lost their young sons, though didn't have that authority, power nor connection, have already shown us that even they willingly went beyond whatever their means to fight for the justice their sons deserved; much less a minister parent?",4,BS_MokiMoki34,2018-09-29 05:25:37,e6skpts

As some here have already pointed out, the right law to help with suicide is under Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. (Or any other mental issues for that matter, if you are facing any please know that you’re not alone in it, we can face them together.)

A law where “actual prosecutions are rare” just means that that law is redundant; we can live without it. The Penal Code is solely meant for punishment. Check the dictionary. Penal means “relating to, used for, or prescribing the punishment of offenders under the legal system”. Like many, I fail to see how this underscores any meaning to aid, rehabilitate or encourage sufferers. As for maintaining a moral ecology, having sufferers try to make their suicides more successful... wow we are going to have truly a more innovating environment. I will not argue whether criminalising suicide is right or wrong, but this law is senseless, out of touch, and definitely in the wrong chapters of the law book.

Personally, I would not even give a second thought about some obsolete law if I felt truly hopeless. What will some string of words do to me when I am already considering the thought of ending my own life? It certainly would not stop me. All I have to do is make sure I succeed. In that moment before death, all I can think about would be that there was no other way. Trapped. Helpless. That I could not live with myself anymore. Everyone around me would be better off without me... There would be no space left in my mind to think about the repercussions, such as how my family would be suffering if I did end my life. There would be even lesser space for me to think about some stupid law. 

The presence of this law will not prevent sufferers  from actively seeking out death.

After all, no one can prosecute a corpse. ",6,ivatyw,2018-10-01 21:12:47,9kbg65

Handcuffs like firearms are drawn from armoury by duty personnel on shifts. They have to be returned like the firearms as they are controlled items and cannot be given away as they will be prosecuted. 

No police officer or Police Force is going to allow a police Office to stand by the dialysis machine while the handcuff is supposedly used for this. 

Criminals or suspects that need dialysis are sent to Changi Prison Hospital. No need for handcuffs as it within prison and there are restraints for difficult people.

Why? because scandals are expensive and outweigh whatever profits retaining the male worker can bring.

Sexual abuse and coercion can and does happen. When it happens and it can be proven, we name and shame the perpetrators. If it cannot be proven and/or it is shown to be an overreaction on the part of the victim, we name and shame anyway.

It is not difficult to imagine an uneven power dynamic where a junior staff person could be coerced into a relationship. And it is also not difficult to imagine a young staff being uncertain if HR would take her side or her superiors.

Further, even with the worst possible motivations, do people really think death is an appropriate punishment for cheating and that she's entirely undeserving of sympathy. There are people more or less celebrating an attempted suicide who need to take a good long look in the mirror.

973kx7,e457xcy,"Twice in his life, Mr Ho, 70, has thought about ending it all.

Once, years ago, the former businessman wanted to throw himself from the top of a hotel because of financial and domestic woes.

He changed his mind when it occurred to him that the 10-storey hotel might not be high enough to ensure his suicide attempt was successful.

In 2014, he went to the top of a 22-storey HDB block. This time, however, his attempt was thwarted by his inability to climb over the railing. He also realised he did not want to bring shame to his family.

Mr Ho, who did not want to give his full name, said he considered suicide because his problems seemed endless and life held nothing to look forward to. ""I thought death would be the solution,"" he said.

Unlike Mr Ho, other seniors who are gripped by the same sense of hopelessness do succeed in taking their own lives.

The number of people aged 60 and older who committed suicide peaked at 129 last year, the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991, the Samaritans of Singapore said last month.

In the past decade, the lowest number was in 2008, when 92 seniors took their lives, and the highest prior to last year was 123 seniors in 2016.

However, given the rise in the number of seniors in Singapore due to an ageing population, the suicide rate among those aged 60 and older has, in fact, decreased over the years, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.

It is understood that the Samaritans suicide figures cover Singaporeans, permanent residents as well as foreigners.

The suicide rate among Singapore residents - Singaporeans and PRs - over the age of 60 has generally been falling over the decade, MOH figures show.

In 2007, it stood at 22.4 for every 100,000 residents aged 60 and above, and the rate was 16.4 last year, with slight fluctuations in between.

Compared with other developed societies in the region, Singapore's elder suicide rate last year was slightly lower.

In Japan, the suicide rate of seniors aged 60 to 69 was 18.8 per 100,000 people last year. In Hong Kong, the suicide rate for people over 65 stood at 24.2 per 100,000 people in 2016.

Still, elderly people remain the group most vulnerable to suicide in Singapore. This ties in with the global trend of elder suicide rates being generally the highest in populations.

Samaritans figures show that those aged 60 and above accounted for more than one-third of deaths by suicide last year.

National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said a key difference between elderly and young people is their different stages of life, and the amount of help or resources they feel they have.

""While a large proportion of young people are likely to have access to the financial and social support of family, in particular their parents, and see themselves at a stage of life where they believe they have some control over how their future will turn out, the same cannot be said of the elderly,"" said Professor Tan.

Experts say the reasons for suicide among the silver-haired are multi-factorial and complex: mental illness such as depression, a lack of social support, physical illness, financial problems, fear of becoming a burden, social disconnection and a lack of knowledge of avenues of help.

Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation, said the elderly are unable to cope with major life changes.

""When the elderly feel overwhelmed by changes and losses, fear nothing will get better and find it meaningless or useless to carry on struggling, that's when thoughts of suicide may arise,"" she said.

For Mr Ho, death seemed alluring when all the central pillars of his life collapsed. His family business went into bankruptcy and he had multiple chronic diseases. His home life, with a wife who was herself burnt out, and an intellectually challenged son, was not happy.

In the meantime, Mr Ho's friends got older and died. Lonely and depressed, he would check himself into hospital, saying he was suicidal.

The turning point came when his frequent hospital admissions and comments on suicide caught the attention of hospital staff, who referred him to the Institute of Mental Health and Tsao Foundation for psychiatric help and counselling.

He was also offered day-care services and sent to live in a nursing home near his house where his family members visit often.

Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health charity Silver Ribbon, said training in basic mental health knowledge is crucial for professionals in the health and social service sectors so that they can recognise the warning signs.

Counsellors say it would also be helpful to address the barriers that prevent the elderly from talking about suicide or from seeking help.

One major barrier could be the law itself. Under Section 309 of the Penal Code, an individual who attempts suicide can be jailed for up to a year and fined.

Though it is rare for a person to be charged with attempted suicide, advocacy groups such as the Association of Women for Action and Research have called for the repeal of suicide laws, saying they deter treatment, not attempts.

A committee, co-chaired by Second Minister for Law Indranee Rajah and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin, which has been tasked with reviewing the criminalisation of attempted suicide, among other things, aims to complete its work this year.

Mr Kelvin Lee, manager at Touch Caregivers Support, said that in addition to formal care services, more accessible modes of help in the community should be mobilised.

Two years ago, Touch piloted a Community Enablement Project in Ang Mo Kio to draw seniors out of their homes through activities so they can engage and watch out for one another.

Residents who once struggled with depression are now reaching out and befriending elderly neighbours.

Another barrier may be the lack of awareness that there are drug and non-drug options that old people can turn to for help.

Professor Kua Ee Heok, senior consultant psychiatrist in the National University Health System who is known for his research on suicide, said it is often linked to depression and therefore long-term prevention of depression is key.

Said Prof Kua: ""Studies have shown that non-drug approaches like using music, art, gardening and mindfulness can help reduce depressive symptoms, and we should encourage such lifestyles.""",6,Jammy_buttons,2018-08-14 16:07:31,973kx7

At some point, he fell because my mom couldn't support his weight and broke a couple of bones. A couple of weeks before he died, he was struggling to breathe, and couldn't eat because swallowing was torturous for him. Through his entire ordeal, he was fully lucid, able to communicate his thoughts to the people around, each word excruciatingly pain for him to utter. Yet we were told we could only administer so much morphine to ease his pain, lest his respiratory function deteriorate.

I wouldn't put it past many students, middle-aged people and even the informed young adult to taunt someone suffering from depression, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder as ""xiao"" or ""gila"" - and that's an extremely disheartening thought, that while the western world seems to be embracing this concept of mental health, we're still rooted in archaic perspectives and stereotypes.

There are owners who refused to put down their pets despite the grim prognosis from the vets. Cases like very old cats with chronic kidney infection for years, and their time has come but owners chose not to PTS because it was cruel and they feel that they or the vets are not the one to decide whether the animal should be free from suffering and would rather leave things to heaven’s hand. When you have a clear look at the situation, realizing that the animals are no longer able to eat, unable to control their pee and poo , drooling excessively on their deathbed, not responding to any medication and any calling or simulation from the owners anymore, you’ll be glad that euthanasia option is available. It was painful for me to watch patients living in pain and grasping for their last breath while some owners I met were in complete denial that their pets are in immerse pain, wishing they just need another few days of rest to get back on their feet. 

I would leave the judgment to the qualified vets who knows better at reading symptoms, making a well assessed prognosis and determining if further treatment is necessary, and I will trust that their basis for recommending euthanasia is done at the best interest for the animal to minimize the suffering.

 From a medical point of view, Doctors are the ones responsible for euthanasia but usually after the patient has signed a document stating/allowing so.
From a nurse's/emergency response personnel poi, not resuscitating can also be seen as euthanasia.
If we talk about euthanasia, how far do we go between failing to save a life and allowing that life to die because it cannot be saved.

 Basically, euthanasia, allows the death of a person to be committed by another human person for the express benefit of the patient alone. The benefit here, is the removal of suffering if continuing to live becomes hard. Then comes the legal headache.... How far is suffering? Vegetable state? Needing medication/treatment to stay alive? Suffering of the family for maintenance or simply being around the patient? What about the signed document? How far can the document go in court if a son wants to fight for his father but the doctor and courts decide to grant the father's wish?

Furthermore. Euthanasia and murder. Not very far apart. One is legal(in some countries, Australia have just recently visited the topic and are coming up with legislation for it) and the other is not.

You just need enough money to persuade the panel and in cases where millions of dollars worth of inheritance is at stake, you wouldn’t mind forking out a fortune to force it through.

8ez5l8,dxzll5t,"This always gets brought up in conversations surrounding euthanasia and to me it is a red herring. 

First, you can address the problem in many practical ways. You can require the decision to euthanise be contingent upon a doctor's (or doctors') expert medical opinion(s). You can link it with the existing advanced medical directive structure, so a patient can make the informed decision ahead of time such that their decision cannot be gainsaid. You can make the family members declare that they aren't up to no good, or criminalise their actions after the fact if they were. 

Second, it ignores the inverse perspective. How many offspring are frittering their resources away taking care of ailing parents who have no hope to live past a few months, who have no treatment options except palliative care, and whose quality of life has degenerated to the point where no sane human being would call it ""life""? Is this not the status quo being misused, to everyone's detriment?

Palliative care is not a panacea that cures all pain. Not only, the amount of opioids (i.e. morphine) needed to give some comfort can further reduce quality of life via the side effects. In some cases, it actually hastens their death.

More importantly, pain isn't the only thing that can reduce one's quality of life. Things like losing mobility or the agency to act independently are not things that palliative care addresses.

>And there is a danger that, since euthanasia is much cheaper, insurance companies and hospitals will push for euthanasia by making palliative/hospice care worse.

You don't see palliative/hospice care worsening in countries that have euthanasia.

>Furthermore, I'd ask how you'd respond to the fact that suicide is impulsive and nearly always regretted when it fails

People who commit suicide generally are those who have not explored all options through treatment. For those who regret it, I think it's fair to say that it was an impulsive decision.

Euthanasia requires that one has exhausted all treatment options and has approval from multiple independent doctors. More importantly, the wish to undergo it has to be explicitly stated and conveyed by the patient. In such cases, undergoing euthanasia is a calculated and carefully considered decision.

How can this be prevented from happening?

I am not disagreeing with you btw. I just want to discuss this further and gain more insight to this issue.

You see, the problem here is that there is too much room for error here. For abuse *not* to occur, *both* these conditions must be met. Hence, abuse can occur if *either* of these conditions are fulfilled. For Euthanasia to be legalized, we need to lower the risk of **both** these conditions:

* Patient is smart enough *i.e.* The patients have been provided with abundant information and ample time to assess any possible repercussions from their decision. 

* Doctors won't be too evil. Let's define that as: The doctors are trusted to make the appropriate, moral (Let's ignore religion for this hypothesis) decision.

If we want to prevent beneficiaries of the patients' Will from using their power or wealth to coerce doctors into acceding to the request of Euthanasia, a separate and independent (ideally, also anonymous) committee to approve the doctors' learned decision can lower the likelihood of the beneficiaries being successful. This is because they would have to coerce/bribe all the parties involved and we are increasing the number of parties involved in this process.

Initially, I thought that the increase in waiting time for the approval of Euthanasia would be a bad thing but I have now changed my mind. In this scenario where there is an abuse of the process, if the patient was in a great deal of pain and wanted to end his life, he would probably be granted his request (Stay with me here; I am working under the assumption that Euthanasia would be legalized to allow for the termination of life when the patient has been shown/seen/proven to be experiencing intense pain). Hence, the beneficiaries would only need to resort to coercion/bribery when it is not so straight-forward and there is a plausible conclusion of the request for Euthanasia being denied. In cases such as these, increasing the number of people involved in the process will ensure greater diligence and reduce oversight in the matter. I agree it is not a fool-proof solution because as you said, humans are involved and we are not perfect but once again, I'm looking at reducing the likelihood of the process being abused / increasing the risk for people attempting to abuse the process that they will be caught in their attempt. Finally, a longer processing time (for the patient who wants Euthanasia but is not in extreme pain) will also allow the patient to attend a higher amount of neutral sessions with various doctors/psychologists to think longer about whether he truly wants to go through this decision.

That is just my two cents. It turned out to be longer than I thought it would be lol.

SINGAPORE - A primary school has told parents to stop spreading rumours about an incident involving some of its students on a school bus, after fears of a ""suicide game"" began to escalate.

Principal of Rosyth School, Madam Elis Tan, wrote to parents on Tuesday (July 24) after rumours circulated online about a game created by students on one of the school's buses, in which students receive ""happiness"" points for good achievements like receiving praise from teachers and lose them for bad behaviour such as not doing well at spelling.

On July 3, a Primary 1 pupil told friends he no longer wanted to take part in the game but they told him he needed to ""die"" from the game before exiting.

While all the others took ""die"" to refer to the end of the game, the Primary 1 pupil understood it literally.

He told his parents about it when he got home, and they informed Rosyth School, which then investigated and found out that nobody had been hurt during the game.

Students were told to stop playing the game.

However, various versions of the incident had begun circulating in various parent chat groups, causing alarm to some.

""The purpose of this letter is to clarify the incident,"" wrote Madam Tan. ""The school... would like to appeal to parents to stop circulating unverified accounts of the case.

""The students have been counselled and advised against the compulsion of others in the playing of games, and the use of loose language, which may be misconstrued and result in fear and anxiety.""

Businessman Seah Kwang Peng, 40, whose daughter is a Primary 3 student at Rosyth, received the letter on Tuesday.

""This is the first time the principal has sent such a letter out, so I assume the inaccurate chatter must have gotten too loud,"" he said. "" It is good that they've clarified it before the online rumours get out of hand.""

On Wednesday night, Rosyth School sent a message to parents, saying that it had just become aware of another rumour and was preparing a response to it.

The school did not explain what the rumour was, other than that it involved Primary 1 and 2 students playing an unsafe game.

8dvcaa,dxqkkln,"Hi! I'm a trans girl currently taking HRT and transitioning. IMH actually has a Gender Clinic that was opened last year, and going by that route allows access to government subsidized medication and blood tests. Here's what you need to do to get access to the medication that you need:

1. Go to a polyclinic to get a referral to the Gender Clinic. This was easy in my experience - just use the most typical explanation even if it doesn't 100% reflect your experience (i.e. ""I feel like a woman trapped in a man's body"").

2. Wait for a few months till your appointment with the Gender Clinic. There are currently two doctors staffed at the Clinic and they are extremely professional and know their stuff. Don't feel worried about sharing with them. The one you consult will then refer you to an endocrinologist (mine is in Tan Tock Seng Hospital).

3. The endocrinologist will order a thorough blood test to check if it's safe for you to start HRT - most of the time it is. Once that's done, you can buy your first batch of medication.

And that's it! It's not that difficult to do it by the book, to my surprise. The cost is fairly manageable - a $70 charge for the once-every-three months consultation, and medication itself costs less than $30 per month.

If you need to be extremely extremely discreet for some reason, it's actually decently safe for most people to DIY, although I'd recommend against it. Here's a list of GPs that may help if you really need it: https://imgur.com/lbEpD2o

I wish you the best on your journey to be your true self!

P.s. as for the naysayers asking this person to reconsider, post-transition suicide is largely caused by societal transphobia, and detransition is still possible if the person regrets it (but very, very rarely happens). Please take a step back and reconsider your personal opinions on trans people - ownself check ownself.

I'm not trying to ""bash"" the trans movement or anything, but I really want to make sure you've thought this through. It's a very big decision to be making at any age, but especially now when we're teens it can be easy to get ""trapped"" so to speak in your current mentality, and not look ahead to the future. Will you feel the same way in 5 years? 10 years? It's hard to say, and there's no right answer, but you should definitely be entertaining these thoughts. If this is an easy decision for you to make then I'd argue that you haven't thought about it enough. According to [this](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf) paper, 42% of MtF people have attempted suicide, and this is in line with most of the other sources I've read.

8dvcaa,dxu55bc,"Hi! Just wanted to drop in to let you know that we exist! I took the private route before switching to the government hospitals for subsidised healthcare. I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist and an endo all based out of SGH. The thing that sucks about the subsidised route is that you're going to be stuck with whoever they assign to you. If you want to be able to switch, you're going to need another referral from the polyclinic or get your current doctor to write a memo.
Why this matters is because sometimes, they might refer you to doctors that aren't as experienced. I believe the polyclinic you go to and which medical group it belongs to also plays a part in which hospital you will be assigned to. In a strange twist of fate, the psychiatrist i was assigned to was the very same MO that was presiding over my SAF 
medical board meeting. While he has, by his own admission, seen a lot of cases like mine, his ideas are still a bit antiquated.

OP is 18 years old. Not a full grown adult in many peoples' eyes, perhaps, but surely capable of some critical thinking?

Don't you think these concerns have occurred to them before? I'm sure you mean only the best intentions, and that care for others is something to be applauded! Not sarcastic. 


However, there is often a tendency in the public to view trans/LGBT people (especially youth) as somehow less able to think critically and make their own decisions. Might your concern stem from such an assumption? Just something to think about. ",16,always_say_birb,2018-04-22 07:27:48,dxqbynq

A friend of mine was considering suicide after his girlfriend of two years dumped his ass and hooked up with some other guy. Of course now looking back on it our behaviors were somewhat ridiculous and showed a complete lack of foresight, but nevertheless at the time our issues felt very real. These examples are completely annecodatal, but I think that any age(but especially youth), we are susceptible to becoming trapped in a certain way of thinking, and not giving due considerations to all possibilities. 

Of course I don't know anything about OP's situation other than that he's 18, but it appears that he's done mainly online research, and hasn't approached a doctor, therapist, or anyone with experience with this kind of situation. Hell a simple google search lead me to https://transgendersg.com/support/, which seems like a place where he could discuss his issues with people that know what they're doing. 

HRT fucks with your body. You will go sterile, and the breast growth is permanent. Outside of that there are also side effects on your liver, kidneys, as well as various cancer risks. If OP is going to go through with this, it should only be done after a lot of thought, and a little bit more planning that ""ok i'll buy these drugs, stick them in my body, and hope for the best"".",-3,SepthSilver,2018-04-22 09:06:52,dxqgtbi

You speculate that it is more difficult to ""pass"" as either gender after going on hormones, but the speculation is debunked by the reduction of the suicide rate from pre to post transition. 

Edit: there are also pre-transition MtFs who choose to look like men to avoid social stigma. However, many who make that choice struggle with unresolved gender dysphoria as a result, that makes their suicide rate much higher than those who choose to transition and try passing as women.",9,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,2018-04-22 08:49:37,dxqkqc4

8dvcaa,dxqq2yq,"Maybe I should have specified that I was currently seeking help from a school counsellor. 

I think I have a pretty good grasp of the potential consequences of transitioning as quoted from my other reply on this post, ""...my current surroundings don't play much of a big role into how I'm thinking. In fact, my coming out on social media recently hasn't garnered me much support from my schoolmates either, so I think it's fair to say that this is not something that I have suddenly thought of on the fly.

However, in regards to HRT, no matter how much online research that I have done, physically experiencing it is probably the only way to understand if I can handle it. 

Although it is my fault that I did not consider local transgender communities, there are reasons why I would rather put it as a last resort:
-It is mentally exhausting to convey whatever I have told my school counsellor to another counsellor.
-I would rather arrange a session with a professional instead of having to be referred to one after seeking help from said communities. School counsellor is in the midst of arranging a session for me anyway.

Maybe it was too rash of me to jump to the decision of taking medication before seeing a professional, but I have thought about this long enough to be able to accept the fact that I will have to bear consequences of the hormonal imbalance. Whether it is bearable or not is only entirely up to me to decide.

8dvcaa,dxqkf0q,"Nope. MtF people pre-transition have much higher suicide rates than post-transition. 

Post-transition, they still have a higher suicide rate than the general population- this may be due to factors like persisting social stigma, and unresolved emotional issues. But it's a significant improvement from pre-transition. Across the internet, people keep severely misintepreting the above findings. They think that the post-transition suicide rate being slightly higher than general population = transition being bad for mental health, even though it's not remotely the same thing. In fact, the study that produced these massively misunderstood findings, recommended that the post-op transition suicide rate can be further reduced through family support and reduced social stigma, so it is a study that is very far from discouraging transition. The recommendation makes sense when you consider that post-op suicide rate is lower in socially accepting nations than transphobic ones.

The general trans suicide rate is high due to many factors, but mainly due to gender dysphoria. OP already has gender dysphoria. Hormones wont give OP dysphoria, in fact it is meant to reduce dysphoria by aligning a trans person's body image with their physical body.",8,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,2018-04-22 08:38:30,dxqk0e3

I don't know how to send a mass reply to everyone who has commented so I may repeat some of my points. These thoughts that I have, of being born in the wrong body, have been with me since the start of secondary school. I won't go into much detail, but the gist of it is that I preferred(and enjoyed) trying to conform to female ideals. I prefer displaying femininity over masculinity, and I believe it is a preference that doesn't require too much thought: what you see is what you like. I'm sure you have your own preferences that you may struggle to find a reason for.

As a self-conscious and anti-social individual, I have spent time that others would with friends, to instead observe and decipher how society acts. I'm well aware of the prejudice that the LGBT community has faced, especially trans people which is the group that I am in, and this is exactly the reason I was scared of asking; because people may not treat my wish seriously. 

Transgender hormonal therapy, which is the process of ingesting hormones to be more inline with the desired gender, is not as consequential or drastic as gender reassignment surgery, and I hope you all can understand that this is the first step for any serious transgender. After all, if we don't take the first step, how would we know if it would turn out for the better or worse? I am currently seeking a school counsellor regarding other emotional issues and have talked about this situation with her.

84gf3u,dvq5t7l,"Not the original commenter, but several things irk me about the article. Firstly, his characterisation of ‘young people’ throughout the article tends to lean towards a somewhat condescending notion of adolescent suicide as a product of frivolous snap decisions and social anxiety. While these factors are certainly significant, the article neglects to consider the more structural and quasi-rational reasons youths may commit suicide, which may not be, as the article’s narrative thread purports, because they don’t feel ‘as worthy’ as their parents, or ‘over broken relationships, getting into trouble with the law, as well as difficult social situations’. 

In fact, despite stating in the article that less than a third of suicides among the young are associated with mental illness, he focuses the paragraphs immediately following that statement with an explanation of the mental illness side of the equation, without elaborating on the two thirds of ‘suicides of sound mind’. By doing so, he side-steps (or only lightly touches upon) a lot of the problematic structures undergirding Singaporean society (the societal focus on examinations as a determinant of self-worth, the highly conservative nature of Singaporean society and the intolerance of alternative lifestyles experienced by a generation with a perhaps stronger need than ever for a sense of individualism) and the influence of emergent digital trends which affect the current generation of digital natives more so than any other group in history (constant bombardment with negative global news and freer platforms of criticism for their own local government for instance perpetuating a greater sense of worldly alienation and scepticism, social media acting as an ideal platform for finding negative echo-chambers whereby such thoughts only multiply). 

A lot of young people nowadays don’t think of suicide necessarily because of circumstances like break-ups and failed tests; there is a looming sense of existential dread and worldly scepticism which I would say affects this generation to a significant degree, and can result in thoughts that life is simply just not really worth it.


In the concluding paragraph, he notes that ‘young people must understand that their lives are not determined by the number of likes on social media or the grades they obtain in school’. This is an incredibly condescending portrayal of youth suicide, and clearly demonstrates the fact that many in their parents’ generations genuinely don’t understand these feelings, and so attribute it to Instagram likes and bad test scores. As I said earlier, no doubt a significant number of people are affected by the issues presented in the article, but he neglects to talk at all about other perhaps larger and more complex factors underlying teenage suicide.


Secondly, his treatment of the emotional/mental side of suicidal thoughts and depression is somewhat poor. He begins first by stating, as the **first** (and thus implicitly most important) answer to the question ‘what is wrong with suicide?’ is that it’s illegal. That does not help anybody experiencing genuinely invasive suicidal impulses; at most, it may make them seek treatment out of fear, but it also reflects a governmental lack of concern with treating the underlying problems relating to suicide, and their solution to preventing it is to punish those in their most vulnerable state. I won’t go into a critique of this law here since the article isn’t taking a stance on it, but merely stating that it exists, but to use that as the first reason suicide is wrong shows a severe inability to empathise with those who may be going through such issues. 

In the next paragraph, as I mentioned earlier, even though he states that less than one third of suicides relate to mental illness, he literally only talks about suicide as caused by schizophrenia and depression, and does not discuss the remaining two thirds. This perpetuates again the notion that teenage suicide cannot be conceived of by a person of sound mind who has in some manner rationalised their thoughts towards suicide not because of circumstantial sadness, but genuine existential weariness. He also discusses the symptoms of suicide in very superficial terms, going into detail about being unable to concentrate on their studies, not getting sufficient sleep, and headaches and stomach-aches. While this may possibly prove useful in looking out for signs of depression, he does not mention the emotional, and in my opinion, more significant impacts of depression like a general sense of apathy, lack of self-worth, etc.

The thoughts I've mentioned here are admittedly anecdotal, coming from my own experience talking with friends about their depression, suicidal tendencies, etc., as well as my own personal struggle with it. In general, nothing he says in the article is *wrong* per se, but it's the same generic stuff youths have been hearing during school cyber-bullying and emotional wellness talks which have always, to me at least, only demonstrated an inability to grapple with the idea that teens may actually have very complex emotions regarding this issue rather than just a crippling unawareness of how to cope with basic life hurdles.

It remains a sort of media taboo to talk about an ""worldly skepticism"" and an ""existential dread"" that a young person might feel after examining the options and opportunities they are presented and found them lacking, inhumane or unfulfilling.  

Too often the conversation is dominated by the voices of adults and scientists shouting *towards* the ""troubled teens"" - and so rarely do we ever get a chance to read the thoughts and words of those contemplating it, possibly for fear that it would resonate perhaps a little too deeply.  To the troubled teen this must feel like everyone wants to tell them how to live, cope, think, and *no one at all wants to listen to them or their thoughts*.  That reality alone could be crushing enough to consider ending it.

I can't help but feel that we are treating only the symptoms, everywhere, while the causes continue to fester.  The truth, which we can't seem to accept, may be that:

We live in a world that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, and the best we can offer is to give them pills and therapies to take away their unhappiness.

The other two thirds, I would bet, are people who have come to learn this truth at great difficulty and personal expense.  So far, Dr. Jean Twenge is the only psychologist interested in *listening* to the cries of the troubled, hoping to find patterns in their plight that would give us actions to take.  

Last time I thought about killing myself was when I read about and saw the images of what my species did to the Great Barrier Reef, through neglect, short-sightness and hubris.  Is there a pill I could take to bring back that life, beauty, and splendor?

The next year, I began acting up in school and got flagged to see the school's counselor. She was a lovely lady who tried her best but I clearly needed more than what she was qualified to deal with. So in this way I muddled on, with everyone but my parents seeing that I needed help, until I turned 14 and decided to illegally work part time to pay for my own treatment. Maybe that intervention came too late, or maybe my family's escalating drama played a role, but it took a hell of a loooonng time, including a couple stints in both the kids' and adults' wards at IMH, for me to work through my issues. 

I'm not writing this to poke at my parents - they had their own problems and just didn't have any resources left to deal with a difficult 10 year old - but to urge any parent, or teacher, or school counselor reading this to notice, really notice your children. Late-early to middle childhood is not too early for depression to set in. I don't mean to rush your child to a therapist the moment they say, ""mummy I'm soooo sad!!"". But observe your children, make yourself available for them, don't discount their feelings, and if something seems wrong, *get them help*. 

I know there's a stigma attached to seeing therapists but seriously, the stigma isn't really there when the patient is a kid. Nobody (I hope) looks at a troubled kid and goes, ""oh it's because kiddo is weak, kiddo just needs to pull himself together"". And even if they do, so what. A kid who's getting help is better than a dead one or one that's irreparably damaged because help came too late.

185 suicides in 1970, but 357 suicides in 2001. 

1.                 According to police records, the number of attempted suicides increased from 1009 in 2011 to 1090 in 2012, or an increase from 19.5 to 20.5 per 100,000 total population. The number of death arising from suicide rose from 8.1 per 100,000 population in 2011 to 10.3 per 100,000 in 2012.  However, year-to-year fluctuation may not be representative of longer-term trends.

Basically, i used tinder overseas and connected with this singaporean girl who has lived there her entire life. We met a few times when she came to SG. We've been texting nearly every single day for around 10 months and I think she's too infatuated with me. 

She's studying overseas now too and occasionally tells me of her suicide thoughts and says she has told no one else and will never tell anyone else. She'll keep on asking for affirmation and if i don't provide it, she'll tell me on the day itself and soon i'll see her saying life isn't worth living and she'll cry and share her suicide thoughts. I like her as a friend, but I always made it clear to her i'm not willing to do a LDR, and right now I feel she's holding her own life ransom and continuously asking me to show online affection to her. I'm VERY worried for her and i don't want to see her sad too, but not to the point of entering a relationship with her and in fact I keep telling her not to be too attached to me, but then she'll think ""does that mean you're not into me"" and the whole suicide thing comes up again.

Back to my review, the comedy is considered cheap BUT I enjoy cheap humours as long as it is done in the right way LOL. I'd say if you are a simple person who enjoys simple movie, then you'd most probably like this movie. I laughed most of the time at their jokes, so did the other people in the cinema. If you are more into the critical side, you'd most probably won't like this movie as it can really be cringe-worthy heheh. but I like it that way :D Of course the books are always better. I've always been a fan and vivid reader of 'DoAWK' and to top it off, this is a great escape movie from typical science-fiction/action movies.

My friend took up a job as a private tutor from an agency and she begun teaching this jc girl in chemistry. The class was supposed to start at 5pm but my friend arrived at 4.50pm at their condo. 

(For those who are unfamiliar, condos have security which doesnt allow any random person to walk into their premises. Someone from the inside has to confirm they know the person) 

She contacted the student's mum and asked for help with verification,but the girl's mum said, ""I'm busy,no choice you must wait"". The student and the student's dad was also at home,and apparently the dad came down,supposedly to fetch her but failed to do so. 

Then they begun the lesson which was supposed to last 1.5h, but the mum intersected at the one hour mark and said my friend couldn't teach because she spent 30min on one question (she spent the other 30 minutes on 6 other questions) and since ""she couldn't teach well, I will have to terminate her"" (in a rather lengthy, entitled text full of short forms) and so she refuses to pay for my friend's efforts (my friend printed worksheets and notes and went to revise the subject for it) nor for my friend's travelling fees. 

My friend approached her agency but her agency decided to not do anything about it. 

For the record, my friend has consistently remained in the top 5% of the college and the only ""U"" she got is the U in the word ""uni"". So it's v ridiculous the mum of the student will say something like that, and my friend is pretty upset about it because she got slandered and had her efforts went unpaid. 

Any advice on what she should do next? Thanks everyone!!

Tldr ; friend went to work for private tuition from agency, student's parent refused to pay even after my friend went through troubles teaching her kid, said my friend couldn't teach/don't know her stuff when my friend literally stayed in the top 5% of the jc the whole two years",4,throwingdaisies,2017-06-01 23:13:03,6eid46

If you guys think it's because you're ugly.. you're not wrong, but you're not exactly right either. Girls are generally less likely to prioritize looks in their partners as compared to guys.

The most common answer is actually linked to that [article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) someone posted a while back. 

Short answer, because you can't offer anything. You're nice? There's another thousand nice guys in front of you man, queue up. You're rich? You just instantly eliminated half of the guys in the ""Nice"" queue. But there's another half who's richer than you. You're witty? Okay, you've moved up another couple hundred places, but you're nowhere near the top.

I'm saying that not to tell you that you have to be witty, charming, rich, good-looking and nice to attract someone. Realistically, she's not going to go for the richest and most good-looking guy, of course. No one is that shallow, and if they are, you're better off looking for someone else anyway. But if you have even one of these qualities, you stand out.

The sad truth is, the world sucks and everyone is selfish. They like people that can offer them things - whether it be validation, money, status, humour, etc...",2,workticktock,2017-06-02 01:00:27,diarjhk

> The Consumer Electronics Exhibition (CEE 2017) markets itself a bit more conventionally – a clean-cut electronics sale that wants to give you the best offers in town. You’ll find plenty of tech from laptops to CPUs, cameras, phones and even Personal Electric Vehicles (PEVs) like E-scooters.

> There is a special focus on trade-ins as well. Trade-in old tech like laptops for cash discounts at CEE 2017, old backpacks for Challenger vouchers and used PEVs for up to S$300 of MOBOT vouchers. Looking to declutter? CEE 2017 may be where you should head to first. Be sure to read up on the terms and conditions first so you don't lug your heavy equipment over for nothing.

> On the other hand, there’s the PC Show, which prides itself as Singapore’s longest running IT fair. It’s even found itself the very prestigious Marina Bay Sands as its location, which will definitely give it a good name.

> You’ll find plenty of reputable names setting up booths here, and be overwhelmed with discounts aplenty.

> The PC Show sets itself apart with its theme, #Techgether, which seeks to showcase amazing tech so families and people can come together to learn and experience. As cheesy as the hashtag is, it's a nice way to package and direct the whole event. ",5,jieqint,2017-06-01 16:43:07,diaomyi

6eid46,dibc8op,"No. The disclaimer wasn't meant as a contradiction, of course. My point is that it turned out to be a contradiction and is quite indicative of your inherently mentality. 

Of course I can't support whatever your psych is saying with ""evidence"" lol. But if he's the one who is treating you and has had extensive contact with you and that you are the one who is paying him for his time, I'd be inclined to believe that he isn't lying to your face. 

Not many people thrive in regimented environment but people put up with it because they are mentally strong or they choose to be mentally strong. There many problems in life that you will encounter as an adult that will be much tougher than whatever you faced in army because there are actual lifelong consequences to those problems. The army makes it really hard for you to run away because there are plenty of hoops to jump through to get downgraded but in the working world, it's much easier to just resign and go because you can't deal with the random bullshit. From that perspective, you're going to keep running away because it's much easier to do that outside. ",3,ElyrionW,2017-06-02 04:50:57,dibbi73

As for him behaving normally, some dogs do not appear lethargic and will continue to act as per normal. This is a basic animal instinct, it is so they will not appear ""weak"". With dogs like that, once they start appearing lethargic, the time starts to tick down and by the time you notice them, it could be too late. I really would suggest your family to get him to a vet if he isn't better by the morning. 

(one of my dogs had diarrhea very regularly for months so I'm very familiar with my vet and doggy diarrhea & they really advise you to bring pets who have diarrhea in so they are able to diagnose and treat asap.

I'll be honest, most Singaporeans seem to be quite shallow. I'm Singaporean too, so I'm not being biased or anything. Looks matter more than they should. They're right after all, first impressions do matter.

But your first impression is more that just how you look, it's also how you hold yourself, how you speak and interact with other people. Even at your age, your character can substitute for looks. However, don't expect your peers to feel the same way. But don't worry, people mature over time, and expectations change. 

In general, I feel that you're right - that your age group really values looks. Looks started mattering less to me as I broadened my horizons and met more people over time. Basically, growing up. It wasn't a definite time. You know by now that looks don't equate character. But you might not feel how true it is until you fully realize it for yourself. Some people never realize at all.

Another thing, unless I'm mistaken, social media has been scientifically proven to make you feel more depressed about your life. I'm at work now so I can't find the link, perhaps later when I get home. But it makes sense, you're viewing the highlight reel of other people's lives. Moments where they are at their best. Daily life isn't that way, and thinking you're not as happy as your peers seem to be isn't going to improve your own mood.

Anyhow, I'm not thaaaat old (i think? D= ), so that's just how I feel now. Who knows, my perspective might change again as I age =)

I know I'm an asshole but I get hot and cold with pretty much everyone I meet, regardless of how much I like them. It's just how I am I guess, my mood fluctuates a lot. I go through periods where I love hanging out with someone, then getting annoyed by absolutely anything they do. I honestly cannot help it, I don't want to be an ass to them but sometimes I just find them so irksome during my cold periods. Yet during my hot periods, I can talk to them for hours and hours on end. 

There might be an undiagnosed mental health problem with me, or maybe I'm just an asshole. Idk. If she's anything like me, I guess it's just up to you to see if you like her enough to push through the trouble. 

Quick edit: also to add on to my previous response. Might it be social anxiety? I used to text some people ALL DAY every day but whenever we actually meet up, I would turn into an awkward potato literally.

6eid46,dicdda8,"Sorry for the late reply man, yup i don't mind sharing my experience tho. 

So, yeah like you, my friend(A) was being rather sketchy not disclosing the company's name. Only showcasing one of their website, the aegle wellness tcm website for me to look at. But in the end, I decided to meet A at his workplace.

So it just happened that went I went to meet A at koufu, i chanced upon my other friend B. B is a friend of mine during ns. He apparently introduced me to elusyf during one of the talk cock session we had. The only difference was that B didn't pressured me into joining or meeting up with him. He was just sharing some infomation about elusyf. 

So when A and B saw each other and B pointed to me, I knew at that point they were working for the same company. At that point, I was feeling betrayed, i meant like why A wouldn't tell me the name. Why was he so scared of saying the name.

Nevertheless, i went along to the company to have a look. So, A settled me down and talk about the company and its history. A went to bring another colleague of his (C), to come and talk to me more in depth about the company. After the brief introduction, they brought me into another room for a more senior colleague to do an intro.

The Senior colleague eventually came, gave a talk about the company, its methods of earning and how to join them.

After the talk, A and I went to sit at one of the tables and A shared about his goals and dreams. 

Eventually, I declined joining and left the company.

So basically that was the brief experience of the day you would have if u went. 

My two cents is : MLM isn't a scam, its just a business model that is prevalent in today's society. It's the tactic and methods that most salesman under the MLM brand used that brings a negative light to the business model itself. Not everyone is cut out being a salesperson. Just like not everyone is cut out being a doctor, runner or a swimmer. Their method is to entice youngsters by using the get rich scheme, how to earn 3x your peers after uni or be able to financially retire by the age of 35 blah blah blah.

But then again who am I to determine what the society can do or not do. If u strongly believe that since you were born, you were given the gift of gab and is able to market yourself very well to get people to buy your products. By all means go ahead, MLM could be the thing for you. However, don't make the decision on the day itself, also give yourself some time to think about it, make a calculated decision. True, you may ended up at a lower tier of the pyramid scheme if u didn't sign up today but if you got the necessary expertise and capabilities, even those in the lower tier can earn more than those in the higher tier. It just that the difference of tier is just the how much commission the higher tier can take from the lower tier every time the latter makes a business deal.

The vet will most likely ask you if he's eaten anything, might do some testing bc some virus will cause your dog to get diarrhea, then give him some pills to stop the diarrhea. Let the vet know that you have probiotics, though I think the one that they give is much better bc they will look at your dog's weight and advice you on how much to give. If your dog's condition is really bad (like mine was), they might ask you to stop all the food given for about a day and make you give him a special digestive can food for the next few days. 

I went to the Mandai Mount Pleasant vet clinic, if you'd like to know which clinic I went.

It's true that looks affect how people interact with you. Attractive people seem to have an easier time in life. But with attractiveness comes problems as well.

For example, imagine you're rich. Assuming you're not an absolute asshole, you're going to have plenty of ""friends"". In fact, you'll have plenty of them even if you *are* an ass. And one day, when you suddenly lose your financial status, how many of them are left?

It's the same with looks, those who don't mind spending time with you despite your looks are the ones who matter. You might look good now, but it might not last. To be fair, some people still look good even when they age, and manage to make it last a long time. Not everyone can do that, and like you said, there's only so much you can do about your looks.

I think a more important question to ask yourself is, why are you placing so much importance on looks? If it's because you're lonely, attractiveness doesn't guarantee a partner - sure it makes things easier, but you can't be sure your partner is attracted to your looks only, or to you as a person. That can be a problem as well.

That being said, there's no right or wrong on the importance of looks. Some people just value it more, some people just value it less. People's opinions differ, and it's just how it is. I'm just presenting my opinion on how I feel about the topic =)",1,workticktock,2017-06-02 22:56:59,dicqfu9

Still super fast though.

Anyway I think non-SCDF 2B is very hard to pass. I don't think there's enough practice. I think I only managed to pass because we were given free rein to just go around the circuit on our own multiple times a day, so I could keep practicing at what I was bad at.

One mistake a lot of us make (myself included) is thinking too much about the timing, so we end up going slow right from the start. Slow + inclined surface means a lot of wobbling, and sometimes we wobble so much we immediately drop off the plank right after getting on.

My technique to stay on the plank at a low speed once you're up: Once you're on the plank, try wobbling your handlebar left and right quickly. Of course, YMMV lol",1,triface1,2017-06-01 21:02:31,diaysrj

>          A Singaporean woman who flew to Taiwan to meet her online lover tried to commit suicide by jumping from a multistorey carpark when he failed to turn up, according to Taiwanese media reports.
The Straits Times understands that the 37-year-old woman is surnamed Chew and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is aware of the case.
The incident occurred at around 12.30pm on Thursday (Dec 28) in Taiwan&apos;s Taoyuan city, at a multistorey carpark in Zhongli District&apos;s Yanping Road, Shin Min Daily News reported on Friday. She was reportedly standing on the parapet at the roof of the five-storey-high carpark.
Taiwan&apos;s Apple Daily news site said the police received a call about the incident and rushed to the scene, along with the civil defence force, which dispatched a fire engine equipped with stairs.
The police were unable to get near Ms Chew as she was in an unstable mood, Apple Daily reported.

same as abortion. 

talk 24/7 about how life is gift from god etc. anti abortion and euthanasia but wont spend time volunteering at old folks home/orphanage or wont donate for such causes to make beneficiaries lives better. 

worst is the creeping religion into secular space. some MPs started making speeches in parliament against abortion say what let the women seeking abortion be 'psychoed' into giving away baby for adoption instead. 

like this champion. never see him care about single parents with kids out of wedlock finding it hard to get hdb flats or how too make singapore more child friendly. (maybe i missed it.) but can come to parliament and talk about such nonsense.

Summary by SMMRY:

> Empirical studies of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in the Netherlands and the United States indicate that pain played a relatively minor role in motivating requests for assisted suicide.
> 
> The slippery slope argument contends that even a relatively conservative law like the Victorian model would evolve over time, becoming more permissive and with the right to receive assisted suicide extending to many others: from physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill and fully consenting adults to euthanasia for patients who cannot give consent - the unconscious, severely disabled children, and the mentally ill.
> 
> The slippery slope argument also raises a practical concern: If assisted suicide were legalised, there must be regulations to ensure that a patient's decision for suicide is informed, competent, and made without any external coercion.
> 
> I'm troubled by the potential effect that the legalisation of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would have on doctors should such measures become routine and we become too comfortable in prescribing and giving injections to end life.
> 
> Professor Ezekiel Emanuel writes: ""Providing the terminally ill with compassionate care and dignity is very hard work. It frequently requires monitoring and adjusting pain medications, the onerous and thankless task of cleaning people who cannot control their bladders and bowels, and feeding and dressing people when their every movement is painful or difficult. It may require agonising talks with dying family members about their fears, their reflections on life and what comes after, their family loves and family antagonisms. Ending a patient's life by injection, with the added solace that it will be quick and painless, is much easier than this constant physical and emotional care.""

The standard Western liberal view that abortion and euthanasia are justified requires the premise that human life is *not* always something to be preserved, and that there are cases where human life should be intentionally destroyed for the greater good.

Both premises can be held by anyone regardless of the presence or absence of religion. But the typical online pro-abortion/euthanasia argument typically ends up with someone going ""lol religious fanatics"" without actually trying to justify their premise that it can be morally justified to intentionally end human life, or alternatively that human life can be creatively redefined in ways that are not acceptable in biology (""Sir, we've found a plant on Mars!

> #####By Won Ho-jung

> Incheon Airport and Singapore Airlines are facing protest from a family after a passenger reportedly suffering from mental illness jumped from the fourth floor of Incheon Airport&apos;s concourse while waiting for a transfer flight to Los Angeles in mid-December.

> The man&apos;s family claims that Singapore Airlines, which operated his flight, and Incheon Airport Corporation should be held responsible, according to news reports.

> The 52-year-old American man, who was travelling in Thailand, decided to return to his home in Los Angeles when his bipolar symptoms reportedly became more severe. His family reportedly wrote to Singapore Airlines to alert them of his condition and ask for special attention.

> The man&apos;s symptoms raised concerns among flight crew on the flight from Thailand to Incheon Airport, according to the air carrier.

> ""Our cabin crew managed to calm and control the customer, who was handed over to airport security staff upon arrival in Seoul,"" Singapore Airlines said in an official statement. ""Singapore Airlines apologises to the customers on the flight who were affected.""

> While waiting for a transfer at Incheon Airport, Singapore Airlines decided that the man needed special care and asked Incheon Airport for support. The man was put under the care of a security official at the airport on Dec. 18.

> ""We received a request from Singapore Airlines and agreed to allow the passenger to stay at a hotel within the transfer centre,"" said a spokesperson for Incheon Airport. ""We also kept an eye on him and did what we could, but at an airport where 200,000 people transit every day it is impossible for us to control any one passenger&apos;s movements.""

> On Dec. 19, the man was caught on CCTV cameras moving from the hotel toward the concourse. He jumped from the fourth floor down to the lobby on the third floor and was immediately moved to a nearby hospital. He remains in critical condition.

> Neither Singapore Airlines nor Incheon Airport said they have received an official notice from the man&apos;s family asking for compensation.

> Incheon Airport denies any liability, while Singapore Airlines told The Korea Herald that any official stance on responsibility is ""currently being discussed.""

The healthcare system (here and in most countries) is such that the burden is on the sufferer/loved ones who notice the sufferer's symptoms to step forward and get help. It can be hard to navigate the system if you're not familiar with it. PM me if you need advice on mental health resources in Singapore, including psych doctors/talk therapy.

To start with, [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/about-chat/mental-health-check/) offers free a mental health assessment by qualified psychiatrists. They will also write you a referral letter to IMH (which I don't recommend unless you are extremely cash strapped) or to a public hospital (SGH, if I recall). As for talk therapy, there is affordable counselling available at [Family Service Centres](https://www.msf.gov.sg/policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Pages/Family-Service-Centres.aspx) and I also find [Counselling and Care Centre](http://www.counsel.org.sg/) to be good. Also ask any psych docs/therapists that you consult with if they offer sliding scales to cater to your financial means.

There's always hope to prevent relapses or weather them better by seeking the appropriate help. Also, you're not a burden. I really hope you find professionals who suit your needs in Singapore. ",3,ragebee,2017-04-27 19:21:58,dgr89mk

This is a pretty fucked up case we got and to those who knew the girl, sorry for bringing this up, personally I really need someone to tell this to because it's really getting to me inside.

A few months ago we received a call, the call text already told us that someone had 'fallen' from 4 stories and the police were already dispatched. Female. 

As usual we got our shit and headed out. 6 mins later we arrived at scene, the police gestured to us from our ambulance to the scene but we already knew where it was, the screaming and crying was there. It didn't take long to see the body, a small girl face down, in the arms of who I suppose was her boyfriend. 1 metre away, her family, crying and wailing at her to wake up. We quickly shoo the boy away and the police attempted to get the family to move back and give us space. No can do, the bundle of tears in the corner refused to budge, crying and comforting each other as their daughter slowly slipped into the afterlife. 

We did our job, in and out, once in a while we hopped over strewn legs as the police attempted over and over again with increasing volume to get an understanding of what the fuck happened as well as move the family away from the body so we could do our job. Every once in a while, I would glimpse neighbours, even a couple of kids walking by and quickly running away, I don't blame them, her arms were like an octopus, doing CPR felt like I was squishing a block of meat. There wasn't any bones between her heart and every push spewed a bit of blood from her mouth. Then, a stroke of luck, CPR worked, she came back, her pulse returned, strong, even my paramedic was surprised, her face was badly damaged as she landed face first and she had lost a lot of blood.

Eventually we managed to load her into the ambulance and send her to the nearest hospital. My paramedic did carried on her work while I radioed ahead to warn them. (The nearest hospital did not have a trauma specialist and had to call one down from NUH) I check the IC to radio the information. Fuck she was only 14 years of age. I radio it in and carry on helping her breathe (She wasn't breathing) At the same time I used a suction machine to clear her nose and mouth. It was terrible, I could see her teeth moving around in a soup of her own blood and mucus, every time I put that tube in her nose it only brought back more blood. Suck and O2, suck and O2, I did that for the time it took for us to end up at the hospital. At the end I had a jar of body fluids to show for my work. I abandoned the suction machine and pulled her out before handing her over to the hospital. As luck would have it, the Trauma Specialist was already there, a previous case my friend brought in, amputation. 

We left feeling happy as fuck, my paramedic bought us a drink for a job well done. her pulse was stable and now it was up to the hospital to finish the rest. 

2 hours later after a few more calls we were resting in the station talking about the case. My paramedic told me that she had run out of the house after an argument. And that holding in her hand was a picture of the boy we assume is her boyfriend when she jumped. I shook my head and thought to myself *what an idiot, hopefully she understands this when she wakes up* And went back to relaxing on the couch. 

30 mins later my Ambulance driver comes into the room and informs us that the hospital called, she had died later on after we had left her. My heart sank, on the outside we joked as we usually do about our patients (It's a good coping mechanism to not take these cases seriously) But inside I felt like shit. All that optimism for nothing. A life lost because of such a stupid reason. I didn't know what I expected to happen but a small part of me hoped she had lived through this. 

I went home later that day, remembering a friend who had killed himself a year or so ago, I suddenly remembered every suicide, every dead person I ever went to, a moment sometimes with clues as to why and how they died. And that did it for me. I didn't want to see any dead people for a long time.

But life (or death in this case) carries on, going back to work, luckily the next few shifts spared me of any really gruesome cases and after a while I got over it. There are times I do sometimes picture her face, broken and bloody in my mind, or remember what my friend was like before he took his own life, or the man who thanked us for trying to save his wife as she died in front of him(And us) even though I know for sure she was gone. I remember them and they stay with me through the rest of my NS experience. 

I try to justify some of the cases, I tell myself that older people have lived a long life, they deserve to choose. But children? Teens? Fuck what have they truly experienced? A first kiss? Travelling to a distant land? Finally being independent? I could and can never justify it in my mind. And I don't.

Suicides are more prevalent than you expect, the ones the firefighters and police manage to pull back into the room are the ones I love the most because they are given a second chance. Yet at the same time I feel a sense of resentment and anger, why was no one there to pull that girl away? Why does this person get a second chance but not the younger ones?

What's more puzzling is sudden introspection about the stressful and unforgiving nature of Singapore society. A pointless and frankly non-sequitur line though of thought.

If we want to put a dent in the number of youth suicides, it shouldn't revolve around 'looking at the bright side' or complaining about how stressful our modern lives are. THey detract from proven, evidence-based population medicine.

513qdw,d79ugr0,"From the replies I see here, there is a terrible misunderstanding on suicidal thoughts and why people commit suicide. This to me is very harmful to aiding suicidal people. 

I have been suicidal before and I have had to be the listening ear and having to ""save"" others from commiting the ending life part. And just in the last few weeks I still have to be there for a suicidal teen.

Suicide is when the emotional and mental pain has exceeded the ability of the individual to cope.

Wtf is the whole rpg analogy about. If you are genuinely suicidal you won't want to do shit. You are feeling so much pain inside that all you want is to end that pain in the quickest way possible. You won't give a shit about doing anything because nothing matters anymore, everything is plain hopeless.

Suicidal thoughts is not a problem to be fixed which seemingly invites the ridiculous notion of giving suggestions of cheering up or u should do this or that and things would be better. 

If you see or know anyone whos suicidal, hear them. Feel what they feel and make their pain feel heard. Your job as a love one or a friend is not to fix them as if they are a problem. Your job is to be there for them, to make them realise that even if you don't understand the pain they are going through, you will walk through it with them even if they sound like a broken record everyday. It's your presence and empathy that matters, not your idiotic analogies/solutions/suggestions which is simply a result of people feeling helpless and not knowing how to help their friend and thus seemingly must say some useless shit to hopefully get their friend out of a rut. 

To those who are suicidal and happen to be reading this, I know how painful it is. I know how hopeless life seems and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel and nothing seems to matter anymore. The darkness and the pain which seemingly nobody understands. You are tired and even more tired of people telling u u should do this or that or to think about what will happen to your family and friends if you were to end your life, the guilt tripping only pains you even more. I cannot tell you that the pain is going to go away anytime soon or that things are going to get better soon. But pls don't give up. Find someone if you are able to whom really can hear u out, someone who really understands. Reach out. Tell them what it is you really need from them, for them to just listen without giving advices.

513qdw,d791uhk,"As someone who used to be suicidal, if there's anyone out there who wants to kill themselves, well, don't do it. Here's why. 

People always talk about how your death will impact your family and friends...and most suicidal people don't care. They just want it to end. Or people say how life gets better, but if you're already depressed, you don't think so. Or sometimes you're stuck in this problem that simply cannot be stopped - so it seems right to die now before everything falls apart. For example sometimes it feels like you're definitely going to fail your exams, so why bother torturing yourself? Or perhaps everything has already gone to shit, you've already screwed up, bankrupt, your SO left, you're sick, and there's nothing left to do. 

Well fortunately there is something left to do. Think of life as an RPG. You only get one go, so even though you've failed your objectives, there is still something to explore in the world. Have you ever wanted to lie in bed and watch TV for a week? Do that; if you have nothing to lose, then it won't hurt you. Have you ever wanted to write a book? No harm trying; after all, you might as well give it one try before you decide to die. Or if you don't feel like doing anything, which is the case for most suicidal people, then don't. After all, if you are about to die, then you deserve to be happy for a day at least. 

Do all the things you can think of that you want to do - or not do - before you die. And perhaps you will spend years doing these things. Perhaps you will find something you really like, and you can decide you want to postpone this dying thing. Maybe you actually want to live. But no pressure. Just do one thing at a time, except dying, because you have to 'get your money's worth' out of this one game. You don't need to be *happy*, you just need to be a little less unhappy.

> On the third day, I left the villa and went outside to kill myself. The sun was beating hard. The air smelt of pine and the sea.

> The sea was right there, just below the cliff - no more than 20 steps away. And the only plan I had was to take 21 steps in that direction.

> In front of me was the most glorious view I’d ever seen. A sparkling Mediterranean, looking like a turquoise tablecloth scattered with tiny diamonds, fringed by limestone cliffs.

> Yet that couldn’t stop me wanting to kill myself. I simply couldn’t feel like this a second longer. I had to end myself - and I was going to do it while my girlfriend was in the villa, oblivious.

> Counting my steps, I walked. Then I lost count, my mind all over the place. ‘Don’t chicken out,’ I told myself.

> I made it to the edge. I could stop feeling this way by taking another step. It was so preposterously easy - a single step versus the pain of being alive.

> If you’ve ever believed depressives want to be happy, you’re wrong. They couldn’t care less about the luxury of happiness. They just want to feel an absence of pain. To escape a mind on fire, where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson.

513qdw,d79u5nj,"Because they *chose* to end it.

For the most part, the sort of depression that drives people to threaten or commit suicide is a luxury that us in the developed world can afford to have. Look at the shit we choose to ruin our lives obsessing over - relationships, self-worth, dead-end jobs - and then look at what plagues the millions of less well-off people out there. Starvation, disease and disasters that wipe out your home, family and way of life. Endemic war and conflict. Mines in the ground and bombs from the sky. Countless people slog through all that just to keep the ones they love alive, to survive, to even attempt to find meaning in the madness of it all. 

And in our air-conditioned palaces, we're going to decide to end it all because our girlfriend/boyfriend left us, we got a D7 instead of an A2, or the daily hustle isn't paying us enough? To splat ourselves on the pavement and betray the opportunities we've been given and the sheer amount of labor from others that went into raising us as a thinking human being? Christ, aren't we narcissistic.

I've been where you come from. I've scraped enough bodies off the floor to be inured to it all. But you know who I *do* feel for? The ones that die through no fault of their own - the unglamorous, old men and women that shoved their selfish wants aside to raise families and sacrifice their living lives for others. The people who bleed out on the expressway in the haze of the morning commute. The mangled remnants of workers that came to an alien land to break their backs for their loved ones back home. The ones that pass away unappreciated yet unbroken.

The oft privileged, born-into-comfort teenagers that chose to throw away their lives - and wilfully tear apart the lives of those that survive them? I'm sorry. Barely a single fucking tear. ",-16,kronograf,2016-09-05 18:51:40,d79efev

Society plays a huge part in such things. Encouraging and educating youth on ways to find professional help is one way, an extremely important way, sure. But medication is not the be all and end all for addressing this. 

An equally important issue is why this is even happening. Professional help addresses the ""after""/""during"" bit. There's a reason why countries like Japan have such high suicide rates amongst the school-aged population. Professional help is only one part of it. Schools should be involved, parents should be involved, society should be involved. Kids should be taught skills on how to express and regulate their emotions, they should be taught stress reduction techniques. You can't just throw everything at mental health professionals. Everyone plays a part.  ",6,Royallyscrew-ed,2016-09-05 11:09:00,d79bph9

This is not to diss the need for a world-class mental health infrastructure, since I'm actually one of the pepole who need it. However, there is a cause, and it SHOULD be addressed whenever suicides come up.

513qdw,d79vyg3,"Nicely written. I was once suicidal myself, having to deal with OCD that crippled me, wouldn't even let me do something as simple as turn off a light, or to close a door. Every moment of my life I just wish I could end it and perhaps start over again because living a life like this isn't worth it. Yet all people know how to say is, ""it will get better soon"". How? You don't know that! You can't promise it! Saying that and then doing nothing about it is twice as worse.

Then there are those who say, ""what about your family? They will be so sad if you blah blah blah"". Guilt-tripping me isn't going to help. Keeping someone alive knowing they are totured by their very existence should really be a crime. But alas, its always ""you are not of sound mind to make your own decisions"". Anyone sucidal is given the same label, we're told that we aren't of sound mind, to even choose what we want to do with ourselves. Why isn't there such a thing as ""putting someone out of their misery"". Everyone thinks that by saving a life they are doing the most heroic thing. But is it worth it if you've just dragged the person back into what is essentially hell for them?

Even though I don't have sucidal thoughts now, I still loathe every moment that I am alive. In fact, the whole past experience has only taught me to hate. To hate myself, to hate humans. I still suffer from OCD, despite having had 7 years of treatment and I know it'll never get better (partially because I don't want it to). To have happy memories, we need bad memories.

513qdw,d7976fc,"This is great, but just to share a somewhat different view: 

I'm of the opinion that suicide is everyone's natural right: if you want to commit suicide, that is a choice. I don't see anything wrong with it. It's sad, sure, but it's a perfectly reasonable response to pain/illness or whatever it is might make one suicidal. By placing so much judgement/fear/negativity on the word ""suicide"" itself, not only do we (as a society) alienate those who are afflicted with such thoughts, we also unwittingly push them towards that very act. 

It's a choice. Having a choice empowers people. 

If you want to kill yourself, you can. You're not the center of the universe. Thousands die every day. You could die tomorrow in a road accident anyway. Nobody can predict these things. It's truly not a big deal. Think about it. Sure, your family will be heartbroken and many others will be hurt too. But in a few decades, you'll be forgotten and there will be no proof of your existence anyway. This is true for most of us, even those who are not suicidal. 

However, I hope you won't. Why? Because what the hell, you might as well live for a while more. You can kill yourself whenever you want. So try life for a while. You have nothing to lose. There's no pressure. Life is a joke. Or a game. Or whatever you want it to be. Nothing really matters. Stressed about your grades? In the grand scheme of things, none of these things matter. Don't catastrophize. It doesn't matter, none of it does.

They end it because they can't take this living hell anymore. And I agree that positive thinking and helping others helps to recover. That's what helped me to recover. But it took time. A LONG time. Like 5 years?

513qdw,d7b4qfi,"Have been depressed and experienced suicidal thoughts at some points in my life. The longest lasted a year and half. Came close to doing it twice, about ten years apart. I have no moral or religious injunction against suicide, so staying alive is really a matter of weighing the pros and cons and a judicious application of strategies that worked for me. 

When it comes to that, those of us who have faced *the* question and yet are still here must have applied one or several methods to stay alive.  /u/llosa described some that worked for her. One of the methods I employed was similar; I see it as a kind of a last meal for a condemned prisoner. Except that hidden in the meal (perhaps in a fortune cookie?) is the possibility of receiving a slip of paper with a pardon. Anyway, mental gymnastics. It doesn't have to make perfect sense. I guess something in me was not ready to give up yet. 

I'd think, if I'm ready to give up everything, why not just take out all of my savings and do whatever I want with it? Travel to the Netherlands, perhaps. Or Mexico. Easier to get stuff that might or might not help (heh). Perhaps go somewhere else and do extreme sports, which I'd never got the guts to do. After all, there is nothing to lose. 

But in the end, I never got to do any of those. Just staying put and planning my next move occupied me enough that the acute sense of wanting to die *right now* just passed. Then it's back to the daily grind. 

At other times, I was just bargaining with myself. I'll wait until tomorrow morning. I'll wait another 24 hours. I'll have a swim, or treat myself to a nice meal, and see how I feel. I utilised my natural sense of curiosity: if I give up now, I won't know what's just 'round the corner. 

Sometimes I pretended I was a beast of burden, with no human perception of suffering, just going about my daily activities because I had to. 

It worked, small battles won, but the war was far from over. I was just living one day at a time, pretending to be normal. I took up music lessons so that at least once a week there was a human being who's expecting me. No one around me, family, friends, colleagues, suspected a thing. 

The depression petered off very gradually that I can't even be sure when it was over. I'm guessing it took between two to three years before I have safely returned to a healthy, resilient state of mind, and I wasn't the same person anymore. I changed jobs in between. I went for therapy. I changed the way I relate to my family and other people in my life. I learned about setting healthy boundaries and realistic expectations. I learned the internal workings of my own mind and learned to accept what I cannot change (still an ongoing process). 

It's been said before, but no two journeys are alike. For people who are in the thick of it, I wish you strength and perseverance. Get help whenever you see the need to. Keep going.",3,hamstertoes,2016-09-06 20:24:08,d792zv2

513qdw,d7a7jkz,"Akajune means well, I get that. I've been depressed for years and years, and every time someone tells me stuff like ""get over it"", ""try to be happy"", or even ""look at starving kids in Africa"", I feel like kicking them -- and I can't tell you how many times I've had people tell me such stuff. It shows a lack of understanding of what depression actually is. 

Depression is a real illness and just like any other illness, it requires professional help. Some get better on their own, some can get better with just therapy, but many others will need both medication and therapy. 

You mentioned that that patients have no control over the factors that cause MDD. There are many causes of depression, and while you are not responsible for your illness, you are responsible for doing something about it (and also the responsibility of your loved ones to help you with it). The reason why I am emphasizing this is because many people fall into 2 categories: either they're pro-medication and believe that depressives are just victims of their illness, or they believe that we are taking the easy way out by taking medication and that we just need to toughen up. 

There are many things you can do to help yourself when you are depressed. But sometimes it can *feel* impossible to do these things and that's where medication comes in. In most cases, medication won't magically cure you, but it will get you to a place where you'll feel better equipped to help yourself (and that's what therapy focuses on). 

Read the top comment by llosa. If you have ever been suicidal, you would realize that it's written with the utmost compassion by someone who has been there. Granted it may not suitable advice for everyone since everyone is different and therefore deals with situations differently, but her advice would resonate with many people who have been there. Her approach is not one of, ""think yourself out of depression"", as Akajune seems to have taken it. A lot of the stuff that she speaks about are actually real therapy techniques (with different names of course). 

Shifting your perspective (through different techniques) is a huge component of therapy. There are all sorts of therapies. Simply because llosa has not stated the specific technique doesn't mean she is talking nonsense. 

If you are ill and have yet to seek help, then definitely seeking help should be your first approach. However, if you are already in treatment and still suicidal, chances are you have to find your own way and try to shift your perspective on your own, or find some other way to survive -- whatever works for you. MDD is not the only cause of suicides -- a lot of suicides, especially by young people, are purely impulsive. Of course there can be another underlying illness behind that impulsive behaviour. 

One more thing: people experience suicide ideation in *many* different ways. Some feel an enormous amount of pain and will actively pursue methods to kill themselves. Some will feel an extreme amount of fatigue and have a deep sense of ambivalence towards dying. Many will have both. Others will experience a lot of fear and anxiety and contemplate suicide in order to get rid of that anxiety. What works to keep you alive will depend largely on how you experience suicide thoughts. 

If you're talking just about MDD, yes, you cannot talk yourself out of depression because it's a real illness where your brain chemistry would actually have changed. However, you can stop the downward spiral by focusing on the positive in your life. It's not a one-time thing. Do it every day. Don't be a victim. Doing things like focusing on the positive in your life (actively focus because the depressed brain has a tendency to focus on the negative), exercising, and even smiling (that's why we have laughter therapy!), eating right, sleeping well (can't sleep well? Get medication. Exercise, exercise helps sleep. Get sunlight, sunlight helps with sleep also increases serotonin production which helps depression). It's all interrelated. All these things target the *same* chemicals that depressives lack. Hug someone, hugging releases oxytocin which supports the serotonin system. There are plenty of things you can do for yourself. Medication is just part of it. ",2,Royallyscrew-ed,2016-09-06 05:12:31,d79xgju

513qdw,d79det3,"I completely agree. And that's why perspective is so important especially for people who are depressed. The other thing is gratitude. Gratitude is one of the best antidotes to negativity. When we are depressed, our brains become strongly biased towards the negative stuff and that's why it's sometimes very hard to have a clear, rational perspective of life. Practicing gratitude increases the serotonin production and increases activity in the dopamine circuits of our brains -- both of which are also targetted by antidepressants. 

At my worst, when I was in the midst of one of the worst suicide episodes of my life, the only thing that got me through was gratitude and perspective. I would do exactly what you said, I would look at the sky and remind myself of how insignificant and small we really are. Depression can make you feel completely alone even when you're in a room full of people. I often felt like the loneliest person in the world, completely emotionally disconnected from everyone. At such times, I would look outside and see the trees swaying in the breeze and I would find a deep sense of connection there. There's life all around us even when you feel alone or depressed.

If I have a love one who's really in so much pain and wishes to leave this world, I will not stop them as long as I have been given the chance to spend the time with them. But that doesn't mean others will share my view. 

As for wanting to spend time with love ones even if they are in severe suffering a selfish view, I think this is an interesting question. 

I would say it IS selfish and it ISN'T selfish. The ""selfishness"" makes absolute sense to me. They love the person, they can't bear to see them leave. They are the ones who will have to bear with guilt too for the rest of their lives. They want to cling onto hope that somehow there might be a miracle. Acceptance doesn't come easily. 

The reverse can be true too. Is it not selfish too to want to leave this world because you are in pain and it doesn't matter how your love ones would feel? In the case you brought up it's physical pain. But for the typical suicidal person it's often due to emotional or mental pain, but it is pain nonetheless.

1. The law doesn't and shouldn't follow society's general consensus. Society should follow the law not the other way round.
2. You're lumping all the people who attempt suicide into one monolithic group of people. There's a spectrum - some people are more desperate than others - and the more desperate ones will be that much more determined to do it well. They will at least do their research and nothing good comes out of knowing exactly how to kill yourself.
3. Knowing the existence of hotlines or the numbers you have to call isn't the same as feeling comfortable to reach out for help. Knowing there are resources and knowing that it's okay to seek them are two very different things.

You use a lot of vague general 'common sense' points of knowledge but I speak from experience. It does matter if it's illegal because it sets the tone for the rest of society and how they view suicide, and those who resort to it.

Yes, instead of letting them kill themselves, we just commit them to a ward where they lie in bed all day long until the medications work. If they don't, I hope they enjoy an extended stay in IMH or learn to lie about their condition.

Like 377A, what is the point of the law if it never gets enforced?

>Since Singapore is subpar, then do share what the 'for par' standard should be.

The standard should be to have facilities that actually provide rehabilitation to patients beyond medicine or once a week therapy. Having visited a friend in a B2 ward, the only things he was allowed to do was roam around a small ward all day. There were minimal activities or amenities that would have made it conducive for recovery.

If we're supposed to have a first class health system, it certainly doesn't apply to the field of mental health.

6a6c0u,dhef6hw,"I honestly can relate, after my Wife delivered our first Son, she didn't had enough breastmilk for him and this kid was damn greedy, she was sad but it was ok, what made me mad was some stupid Facebook group and WhatsApp group she joined, retarded bimbos in there insisted that she as doing harm to our Son by feeding him breast milk and that she MUST breastfeed. I noticed she was getting slightly depressed and after trying to find out but by bit I realised the root of the issue and simply took her phone, fuck all the retards in the group chats and left, afterwards it's more clearing some leave and staying with her to ""sell"" her the idea formula is fine too.

On a side note, I have a Friend who is an E cup with no breastmilk and the in laws always commented ""這麼大粒，沒奶？"" in Hokkien and Chinese.... it means ""so big breast, no milk?"" 

All in all, at least in my opinion.... having kids means both couples need to commit and not expect the mum to solely handle everything which is the case in some families that I see. Breastmilk or who takes care don't matter, if you face an issue try to talk and look for a solution together, the key is to raise the kids in a happy environment while ensuring we give and guide them, what others say don't matter since every kid is unique and there is no ""one size fits all"" method for anything.

I know this is a tragic case but saying no place to turn to is a bald-faced lie. Just googling the word ""suicide"" shows Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) 24 hour hotline and NCSS list of helplines including IMH 24 hr hotline, Breastfeeding Mother's Support Group Counselling Helpline etc.

That's what the hotlines are primarily for. I'm not saying the hotlines are perfect because the other side is human too. I'm addressing the comment that ""no place to turn to"". 

Speaking of the SAF hotline, if your superior is being a fuck ass, asking you to do unreasonable shit, call it and explain your situation. SAF might have a shitty reputation of having dumb policies but you can bet your ass they also want to siam problems.  

During my time there was a guy who took a fuck ton of MCs because of his skin condition like 2months/3months MC back to back type. It was obvious he needed the MCs because his skin was always in a disgusting condition, pale, flaking off with blood patches. Our CSM wanted to give him a hard time, to make an example out of him so he told him that he had to report every monday to camp to endorse his MCs. 

He called the hotline and the medical board cc-ed an email thread to HQ and all the nodes about SAF MC endorsement policies, basically telling the encek that he can't do shit to the guy with valid MC.

It does, but from personal experience, the anonymous helplines and stuff in SG don't really help. There's almost no social support for this sort of thing, except through pretty impersonal contact - by phone, or over the internet. Getting some good, face-to-face help and intervention is pretty fucking hard here.

The parallel is that the overall culture contributing to these social problems in Singapore isn't fully the government's responsibility, but for a people who constantly reelect a nanny state, you have to admit that they have been given a lot of influence, and they use it too, as they see fit to ensure Singapore's economic and national viability.

NSFs would need to use the hotline a lot less if the regulars treated them like peers who are trying to serve the country just like them.

**EDIT:** I'm hijacking this comment to address /u/skipshentaiscene's comment, which I think is a useful jumping-off point for a good conversation about the utility of news media: 

> I read the article and didn't find anything flagrantly wrong with what he said tbh?

**27 kids killed themselves in 2015.** That's more than 1 coffin every fortnight. This is out of a total of 409, which is more than one every day. Now, that's 6.6% of suicides being from ages 10 to 20. (For context, 10-20yo's make up 11.4% of the resident population.)

The questions on everyone's minds are: **Why** are these kids killing themselves? **What** should we do about it? 

According to the article's representation of its quoted expert,

* recognize that suicide tends to occur because of several sources of stress (opening)
* don't be dismissive (good advice!)
* acknowledge and validate their children’s problems (good advice!)
* ""reiterate that while we seek to understand suicide, it remains a complex human behaviour that cannot fully be attributed to a single cause."" (closing)

Most people, when consuming any sort of media, will remember the opening and closing bits most strongly. They'll largely gloss over the good advice in the article (acknowledge and validate your children's problems), and their takeaway will be ""suicide is multi-faceted and we cannot blame a single factor"". This is unfortunate. 

Consider the context in which the news article is arising – a boy recently killed himself because of his grades, and people will want to know what the implications are for our cultural and social attitudes towards education. This was **not** addressed in the article – could be because the journalist is short on time, or maybe the editor wants to play it safe (to 'avoid anything flagrantly wrong').

**TL;DR:**

The article avoids saying anything wrong, but it also avoids tackling people's concerns and suspicions head on. This dilutes media quality. We know from experience that school is stressful. We know from experience that it gets COMPOUNDED by family and peer pressure (they aren't separate variables).

>From what I know, CCTV is often grainy and unclear (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Short answer: Maybe

Long answer: It mostly depends on the type of camera you use and the system it saves the footage to. CCTVs have to record constantly without breaks and save the footages for weeks if not months. Try taking a 5 minute video with your phone, look at how much storage it takes, and multiply that by 12. That's just 1 hour worth of footage. If the system has terabytes of storage for each camera, you can assume it's 720p similar to the video on your phone.

But if they touch you inappropriately or anything, you must tell mummy when you come back."" I believe the advice won't vary much for other families. Most of the time it is about giving teachers the respect they deserve but report any sexual/physical abuse. 

Similarly, while my mum also used the ""If you are naughty, I'll ask mata to come and catch you"" scare tactic, she also reminded me regularly that ""If the police ever question you, call mummy and don't be afraid. Do not ever admit to something you never do. You have nothing to be afraid if you did nothing wrong."" 

It is important for parents to realise that when their kids start going to school, they cannot be there to protect them 24/7 and hence the need to advise their kids appropriately.

If you go around and see how people think about NS servicemen, there isn't really much respect. If they sleep on the MRT also kena stomp, work Grab part time also kena sabo.  Singapore completely lacks any prestige for servicemen. Let me tell you my US experience: I had travelled to the US and my dad bought a hat from some US army airplane museum. When he wore it and went around the hotel, there were a few people who would say ""thank you for your service!"". It was honestly eye opening for me. I wonder why it's so different over here.

Another issue is that they lose 2 years of their youth. If you look at South Korea's conscription, they do not force you to conscript at such an early age. If I remember correctly you just need to enlist before your 30s, if we modelled after them, these people would have also finished their pursued education or early career which banks quite a bit on youth.

**The truth is, for all the benefits that NS gives us, Singapore is ultimately defenseless against any foreign enemies who are serious about invasion.** The Singaporean army size is insignificant compared to that of our neighbours, and it always will be, by virtue of our small population size. Despite our large pool of reservists, given the prominence of total warfare in the last century, countries like Indonesia will always be able to outnumber us assuming every last man is mobilized, simply because they outnumber us 40 to 1. **Even ignoring the numbers game here, Singapore is fundamentally hard to defend due to the fact that its small size lends it little [strategic depth.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_depth)** The North Vietnamese were able to conduct a successful guerilla campaign by withdrawing into the vast expanses of their dense jungles. In contrast, the land area of Singapore would be quickly overrun and easily occupied by any serious professional army of respectable size. The small size of Singapore limits our defensibility and prevents the mobilization of our large reservist pool in any significant number.

Regarding your point about the lack of manpower in civil service jobs such as firefighters etc., there is a very important distinction between the public and private sectors. That is, **the government has direct control over the wages of civil servants.** Simply adjust the salaries of firefighters and policemen and leave the rest to the market forces of supply and demand. The same can be applied to the Army should we decide to maintain a respectable size without conscription. 

Instead of relying on an army that looks decent on paper but ultimately does nothing to deter any potential aggressors, Singapore should look to other methods to safeguard our independence. The Swiss in particular have been able to protect their citizens and remain largely independent for much of the past 700 years through their establishment as the banking capital of the world. Weaving a complex and interconnected web of international finances around them has made it unprofitable for countries to directly attack them, and allowed them to maintain Swiss neutrality with a comparatively small army even while destructive European wars waged around them. **My point is, NS is not the only way for Singapore to ensure its independence.** Defense treaties and international agreements are not ""depending on other countries for protection"".

9bphtf,e54wshh,"> N.S isn't only about army too. We need to maintain a sufficient workforce for our civil services (police, firefighters etc)

The notion that NS is necessary to maintain our ""civil services"" is patently false. Consider this: Only 26+ countries have conscription, yet many countries manage to maintain their ""civil services"" just fine. Amongst the many countries that are doing just fine are numerous countries with similar population sizes, such as New Zealand, Ireland, Hong Kong and more.  

As for the military, I'm actually all for improving ours. I would support increasing our defense expenditure in the coming decades, because historically, the probability of global conflict has risen whenever the incumbent global power has waned. This has been true throughout human history, from the Roman empire to the British empire, till today - the US is losing ground to the Chinese, and is unlikely to graciously surrender their hegemony.  

That said, militaries around the world are moving toward a ""leaner but meaner"" approach - improving a modern military is about cutting numbers while embracing technology. Take China for instance, considering their prickly relationship with the US, they have every reason to take their military very seriously. Yet they have been cutting troop numbers: [Why China Is Trimming Its Army](https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/why-china-is-trimming-its-army/). The same can be said of the Russians: [Russian Military Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Russian_military_reform), and many others. Indeed, in this day and age, you will be hard pressed to find a modern military that is increasing its manpower.  

Why is this happening? Because modern technologies provide a massive edge over raw numbers. Recent conflicts like the Russian intervention in Ukraine clearly illustrate how ground troops are increasingly becoming nothing but cannon fodder for the latest technologies - why field a mediocre platoon of conscripts when an unmanned drone or precision targeted strike can cut them down at next to no cost? Consider the US elections too. Russia has done massive damage to the US and NATO using just a couple dozen trolls. Indeed, some believe that their trolling tech has done more for them than their million plus soldiers ever could. Wars are being won and lost in labs, and forward looking militaries are aware of this.

As our ex-military leaders have ventured into the public sphere, it has become evident that our generals tend to be status quo loving and somewhat inefficient. It thus comes as no surprise that the SAF has been late to embrace technology over numbers. If they manage to embrace tech, the SAF has a better chance than ever to thrive on a fully professional force. A common retort to a fully professional force is the notion that ""not enough people will sign on"". This notion does not take into account the fact that by saving on conscription expenses, pay for military personnel could be increased significantly. Moreover, the SAF will no longer be seen as an adversary of the people, and so soldiering could become respected in the same way that Singaporeans respect certain professions.

There will be a whole slew of problems to come when you force your entire young population to enlist.

As a result of a late start to their career, women might choose to have kids later as well. Impacting our population growth rate further.

All of this only points to one natural conclusion, more foreigners being brought in to support the economy and population. We're gonna have to be prepared for that if we ever go down the female enlistment route.

The North Vietnamese were able to conduct a successful guerilla campaign by withdrawing into the vast expanses of their dense jungles. 

It is precisely because we have no depth at all that we need such a large orbat to create that depth. If we were the size of Johore, maybe we could get away with an army 2 or 3 brigades strong and this could conceivably be a 2/3rds professional, 1/3rd reserves army. 

But we are not and no manner of raising wages will enable us to raise a professional force of the size necessary. 

> In contrast, the land area of Singapore would be quickly overrun and easily occupied by any serious professional army of respectable size. The small size of Singapore limits our defensibility and prevents the mobilization of our large reservist pool in any significant number.

That's why, I presume because that is the reasonable thing to do, we would have intelligence people who would monitor the movements of forces nearby. And that we practice mobilisation like no one else does. And don't underestimate our small size because that allows us to concentrate forces like no one else can either.

Regarding your point on Swiss neutrality and making themselves a useful and hence protected member of the global community, well SG is sort of doing that with the banking sector as well.

Hardly true. There are actually very few countries that can invade Singapore aside from the super powers. You are only taking the army into account and you are completely discounting our geography, our air force and navy. We are an island nation and to invade us, you either have to go through Malaysia or attack from the sea. Attacking from the sea is complete suicide because the RSAF will stop anything coming from the sea. 

Our air force is insane for a country of our size. The only country that has a larger air force : population/GDP ratio is Israel. There is no air force in the neighboring SEA region capable of matching us. Even if all the SEA countries were to combine their air forces, they are still unable to match the RSAF.

After discounting the superpowers China, India and USA, the only big regional countries left in Asia are Japan, South Korea and Australia. Their air forces are on par with us in terms of technology but they are about twice as big as us. This is pretty impressive when you consider that Australia is 5.5 times larger, South Korea is 9 times larger, and Japan is 23 times larger in terms of population size.

However they are also a huge distance away from us, so they have to deal with the logistics of flying their aircraft over. None of these countries possess aircraft carriers and they will have to directly fly their planes over from their country. It is therefore logistically impossible for them to fly their entire fleet over to Singapore, giving us the numbers advantage as we can quickly land our planes, refill, re-arm, and have them flying in the air again.

So no, it is not true that we are defenseless against foreign enemies who are serious about invasion. Putting aside the super powers, there are almost no countries which are able to defeat our air force. We followed the Israeli doctrine of building an insane airforce and it definitely shows. If you notice, the RSAF uses many of the same planes as the Israeli Air Force.

Hitler made plans to invade Switzerland but fear of Swiss martial resistance and that the entire country was rigged to blow up made the cost to take Switzerland heavy enough even to dissuade Hitler. This goes to show how important having a strong defense.

One can make the argument that the Swiss banks benefited from Swiss neutrality because Switzerland is such a safe haven. In fact, our initial military doctrine was based on the Swiss hedgehog and they still maintain conscription even though the army has been greatly reduced.

9bphtf,e54wslg,"**2008 Russian military reform**

Significant reforms of the Russian Armed Forces were announced in October 2008 under Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov, and major structural reorganisation began in 2009. The stated aims of the reform are to reorganize the structure and the chain of command in the Russian army, and to reduce it in size.Key elements of the reforms announced in October 2008 included:



reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million by 2012;

reducing the number of officers;

centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres;

creating a professional NCO corps;

reducing the size of the central command;

introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff;

elimination of cadre-strength formations;

reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system;

reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.There had previously been several reform attempts such as the 1997 plan under defence minister Igor Sergeyev and the 2003 programme of President Putin (‘Urgent Tasks for the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’), the latter of which was very similar to the 2008 programme, as it emphasized already the need for reductions in personnel strength, a gradual decrease in the use of conscripts in favour of professional soldiers, the creation of a professional NCO corps and drastic changes to officer training and education. The 2003 program however moved at a very slow pace, mainly due to the unwillingness of the military to reform.

In my opinion the idea of preparing for a  pre-emptive strike to create ""strategic depth"" in the remote possibility of war with our neighbours is not worth the enormous costs. I envision the army as more of a defensive force/ armed militia, as in hunker down and fight street by street to make invading us as painful as possible. I think that would suffice as a deterrent with much less training neccessary (e.g. overseas exercises). Instead of trying to make conscripts into professionals, focus on the benefits of a conscript force (sheer numbers) to make Singapore as a whole more prepared. 

I would think that if our neighbours knew that there were 2 million (give or take) armed and trained militia who were ready to stand and fight, they would think long and hard before trying anything. Besides, we could still field a smaller professional force to supplement the larger militia. Not to mention the airforce and navy. 

As for commanders I think it would be neccessary for those who want to be officers or sgts to extend their service or sign on.

That way we ensure that commanders are well motivated and actually have a desire to serve actively in the army above and beyond what is typical, while those who would rather serve and f off can choose to serve for less time but have less responsibilities/power. The longer service period would also reflect the cost of the prestige and benefits of being a commander. We would also have to compensate commanders appropriately commensurate with their increased responsibilities. 

Change is unlikely because people in power are more comfortable with the status quo, that's true. But that doesn't mean we have to disregard suggestions that would improve the system out of hand. After all, on election day the power is not with the BGs, MPs and Ministers, but invested equally in every citizen, (whether REC or CDF) in the voting booth. If you believe in change, use that power to effect it!",2,shimmynywimminy,2018-09-01 08:04:41,e55p300
9bphtf,e55ul6u,"If we were training an army to conduct advanced operations beyond our borders such as striking overseas into enemy territory, I would completely agree with you. But what I'm suggesting is that the chances of conflict happening are so low that it's not necessary or worth the huge cost, and that a similar level of deterrence could be achieved at a far lower cost. (When we talk about cost I'm referring not to money spent, which the govt has an incentive to reduce, but rather the sacrifices made by our conscripts, which the govt is all to happy to exploit.) 

I see the bulk of army not as a invasion force, but as a defensive/militia force that would, in the case of war hunker down and fight street to street to make invading as painful as possible. Under such a system, most soldiers wouldn't require such a high degree of specialization and training. Now I'm no expert but in absence of a real and immediate threat (like in Israel or SK), it's not worth it to try and make conscripts into professional soldiers. Rather, we would embrace the benefits of a conscript army (sheer numbers) to serve as a deterrent. I think our neighbors would think twice about ever invading us if they knew that 2 million people were armed and trained to resist enemy forces every step of the way. 

&#x200B;

That doesn't mean we would do away with units like Armour, Artillery, Engineers and Commandos, just that they would be a much much smaller part of our total strength, be comprised almost totally of full time regulars and merely complement the larger bulk of reserves. Of course the navy and air force are also currently mostly professional already so not much would change there.

Ultimately the best we can do is not enough, and any of our neighbours can see through an invasion with enough political will and military might to spare, hence the need for redirected focus away from an ineffective Armed Forces into other methods of preserving the peace.

>we already know relying on other countries for our defense and security is ultimately a crap shoot (see: British Empire), so why go back and try something that we already know won't work? 

As I said, the goal is not to rely on other countries, but the establishment of international agreements with multiple countries involving a mutual exchange of services such that other countries also depend on the (mostly economic) opportunities we provide. This makes us indispensable to other countries and renders war unprofitable, not to mention the possibility of retaliation from our allies.

I make this assumption based on the fact that warfare between industrialized countries has become increasingly ""total"" in nature. Nation-states are now willing and able to go all out with the economy, industrial production and civilian mobilization all being utilised to their full extent for the purpose of waging war. Gone are the days of the Late Medieval Era where war was fought by knights and mercenaries while peasants simply toiled under a different master.

9bphtf,e556mfb,"unfortunately I have to disagree with you there - the ability to defend ourselves doesn't *necessarily* give us the independence and neutrality. Any country that would seek to make us non-neutral doesn't only stand to gain politically, but most importantly economically. I don't think this is about defense as much as it is about politics and economics. The point is that if they have an interest in our neutrality (or lack thereof), they stand to gain from our position on the global stage. That very heavily diminishes the incentive to compromise us defensively, not only because they would in effect shoot themselves in the foot, but that important economic and political allies of ours would respond very negatively towards them. The only countries with real power to throw a wrench at us and not have other countries lash out militarily for fear of their position, power, and bulk are the US, China, Russia, Germany. And Germany doesn't even have a military - they've committed it to the EU. These 3 other countries would absolutely crush us militarily regardless. That's why for me it's not the size of the military that matters at all, and why I think necessary conscription is past its prime. I think we are possibly overcommitting resources to the military when we can review and focus military resources towards the construction of an extremely efficient, potent, advanced, and effective military that would seriously help in neutralising threats that are not Singapore-ending level. I know in warfare numbers matter, but if war happens in Singapore we are **necessarily** fighting a home war - there are **no** fringes of the country that we can carry out a war of attrition where numbers would be truly the difference. With a home war comes the home ground advantage, as well as the spirit of the soldier who fights for their family.

The only edge we have is technological advances which is a debatable topic itself as most equipment for the typical men are outdated/damages/not maintained properly.

The only useful things right now are the SCDF, SPF and certain elite vocations which are sent to countries as relief aid which accounts for a small portion of NSFs.

In my opinion, in its current state, NS is mostly useless and might as well not be there. In my opinion the government is better off by offering much better incentives and higher pay for said vocations instead of a forced conscription.

Either way, even if Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia roll over without fight, we will likely face troops from their southern theater command which is about 20% of their strength with extremely long and fragile lines of communications. I think the SAF can give them a pretty good fight.

Invading by sea isn’t even an option as the Chinese navy has practically zero long range force projection capabilities, not for 20-30 years more. By which time, if that is a threat, our forces will adapt accordingly. We won’t win but we’ll give them a hard fight.

Tyranny of the majority (or tyranny of the masses) refers to an inherent weakness of majority rule in which the majority of an electorate can and does place its own interests above, and at the expense of, those in the minority. This results in oppression of minority groups comparable to that of a tyrant or despot, argued John Stuart Mill in his famous 1859 book On Liberty.Potentially, through tyranny of the majority, a disliked or unfavored ethnic, religious, political, social, or racial group may be deliberately targeted for oppression by the majority element acting through the democratic process.American founding father Alexander Hamilton, writing to Thomas Jefferson from the Constitutional Convention, argued the same fears regarding the use of pure direct democracy by the majority to elect a demagogue who, rather than work for the benefit of all citizens, set out to either harm those in the minority or work only for those of the upper echelon. The Electoral College mechanism present in the indirect United States presidential election system, and the phenomenon of faithless electors allowed for within it, was, in part, deliberately created as a safety measure not only to prevent such a scenario, but also to prevent the use of democracy to overthrow democracy for an authoritarian, dictatorial or other system of oppressive government. As articulated by Hamilton, one reason the Electoral College was created was so ""that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications"".The scenarios in which tyranny perception occurs are very specific, involving a sort of distortion of democracy preconditions:



Centralization excess: when the centralized power of a federation make a decision that should be local, breaking with the commitment to the subsidiarity principle.

9bphtf,e54yjsq,"I could call you a naive edgelord too, but that's not helpful, is it? Why start off any discussion with a personal attack, even at large?

On the actual topic of discussion - try to consider an alternative viewpoint, that our current state of affairs is a) abnormal; and b) a result of the processes we have in place. 

We just need to look at countries that did try to demilitarise, and see where they are at now. It's not a coincidence that Europe and Japan are remilitarising. Russia is putting on a massive military exercise *based on an invasion scenario* during a time when they're cutting back on social spending. The Korean peninsula is in a state of ever-flux. Countries that have thought they could get away with demilitarization are reversing course. Why do you think that is?

A valid argument could be that none of our neighbours are militarised to the extent of Russia or North Korea. But the considerations to take into account for this are a) purely on an as-is basis, the size of the militaries of our neighbours already outstrip us *with our conscription*, and b) militaries take time to build capacity, and cannot be put together instantaneously. A consequent argument could be made that we should tailor our military budget to that of our maintenance, which is valid - but that presupposes our military is actually growing, and that such maintenance should be done in such a manner that the relative gap between us and our neighbours is maintained. Pertinent side note is that Indonesia has been looking to strengthen their naval presence for a while now.

Teddy Roosevelt's idea of speaking softly while carrying a big stick is sound. If an argument otherwise is to be made, make it. It's not constructive to just tar everyone who disagrees with you with a label. Convenient, but utterly intellectually lazy. ",6,owlbunnysubway,2018-08-31 19:52:11,e54uz0k

9bphtf,e55307z,"> I make this assumption based on the fact that warfare between industrialized countries has become increasingly ""total"" in nature. Nation-states are now willing and able to go all out with the economy, industrial production and civilian mobilization all being utilised to their full extent for the purpose of waging war. 

This honestly seems like a rather overblown statement extrapolating too much from the relatively small number of major wars like WW2 or the Vietnam War. Such a scenario is arguably only applicable in the fairly extreme scenario that total warfare is relevant politically, which in turn would involve quite a number of other geopolitical and diplomatic concerns; total warfare is really only considered when the society or at least government deems the war so important as to make significant sacrifices in all other area, presumably due to a sense for fighting for survival. This is not the case, for example, in many 'skirmishes' between larger powers (e.g. the China-India border conflict), or more lopsided operations (the USA versus many smaller countries). For such a situation to develop between Singapore and her neighbours would involve an extreme breakdown of relations, to such an extent that ASEAN would basically have completely disintegrated.

Leaving aside perhaps the situation of these countries somehow degenerating into a military dictatorship, it would really take something extremely drastic for a democratically-elected government in those countries to persuade the populace to support total war against a small country like Singapore; just try to imagine a future President of Indonesia or PM of Malaysia trying to tell voters that they need to implement massive country-wide conscription to take down Singapore in a military invasion.

If I apply your logic to men: 

1) I could also counter with that delaying men’s career/future by two years is perhaps even more damaging as in traditional societal roles men should provide finical stability. This equates to less family planning and delayed childbirths or even no children.

2) if you apply your logic to males, are you saying that if males don’t serve NS our birth rate will go up and age of married couples will be younger as they should be able to start a family earlier right? females serving NS can then rely on males for financial stability to start a family unit as their life has been delayed.

However, to call NS slavery is to degrade and dismiss the conditions slaves in the past experienced, as well as people even now who are undergoing similar or worse situations, having no choice to get out of the the hellholes they are living in.

NS states clearly the terms which you are to undergo, and the benefits that you receive as well as a citizen (for the wider community, not personal) is a pro. You get to book out, stay out even for some, receive at least some compensation for your time (whether it's enough or not is a separate issue), don't go hungry, have a nice bed to sleep in (most of the time), and generally you still have your freedom, despite being limited in some ways.

And once again, we would still have a professional airforce, navy and army to support the reserves. 

Besides, it's highly unlikely that even our current armed forces would be able to acheive an outright victory in an armed conflict.

No, there are different types of slavery. Not all slaves experience the same conditions, and there are varying treatments imposed on them. But, one such treatment is universal (and you said it yourself): having no choice to get out of the the hellholes they are living in.

>NS states clearly the terms which you are to undergo, and the benefits that you receive as well as a citizen (for the wider community, not personal) is a pro. You get to book out, stay out even for some, receive at least some compensation for your time (whether it's enough or not is a separate issue), don't go hungry, have a nice bed to sleep in (most of the time), and generally you still have your freedom, despite being limited in some ways.

Whether you receive benefits from your slavery is irrelevant. Whether you receive compensation is also irrelevant (some slaves throughout history were also compensated). And whether the terms are clearly stated is also irrelevant. What does ""terms and conditions clearly stated"" even have anything to do with it? Even these ""terms and conditions"" are routinely broken anyway. I have a feeling you're just throwing stuff out hoping something ends up being relevant to the point.

The fact remains that your life is owned by the state, and that makes you a slave, and the state the slavemaster. The fact remains that the state can compel you to risk your life to fight for it and even force you to sacrifice your life. That is ownership. The the NSF loses their bodily autonomy.

>How can you compare this with the conditions slaves go through? The worse of them were not even treated as human beings. They were shipped to an unknown land, forced to shit on top of each other, and didn't even have enough space for them to stand upright like a human being, forced to work under the hot sun for nothing, whipped if they didn't comply.

Since when did I compare the conditions? I did not say NSFs faced exactly the same conditions slaves went through, although some are similar. If slaves didn't obey they might be whipped. If NSFs don't obey, what happens? They get arrested, sent to jail, and if they resist in self-defence, they get violence inflicted upon them by agents of the state, then sent to jail nevertheless.

Secondly, the volunteers who man the calls do their best to be empathic but they are not there to fix or solve your problems. Their main objective is to get you to not do anything that might harm yourself, and if possible get you to seek professional help in person. 

Third, they are not friends whom you can pour out for hours. They do have a time constraint and thus they cannot be on the phone with you for hours and hours. Some people may feel upset that it feels like a touch and go thing and not feel they are really being helped.

At the end of the day, they are doing their best to help whoever is calling them. 

All that being said, if you are feeling suicidal right now, you are welcomed to talk to any of us over at /r/sgkindness and I'm sure there are plenty of people here in /r/singapore who doesn't mind being a listening ear. 

Whatever that is bothering you, I'm sure you must be feeling despair and very helpless to have to consider calling the suicide hotline. But please do not give up.

Don't feel disheartened if you can't find a right one right off the bat. They do want to help and they also do understand that someone may not be entirely comfortable for whatever reason with them, so feel free to request for a change in doctors/ therapists if you feel the need to.

> Lastly, the policemen interviewing him, couldn't they wait for an adult/lawyer before taking his statement? How will a 14 yr old ever know what his legal rights are?

in some countries (most notably the US) you have a constitutional right to legal counsel as well as to silence

basically this means that if you're being interrogated and you don't have a lawyer present you can sit down and shut up until you do and they can't do anything about it

but in Singapore the right is circumscribed, ostensibly for reasons of efficiency

so basically you can't do that; if you do you are liable to have an adverse inference drawn against you in court (i.e. the judge will be like ""you jibai why never say earlier??? i donch believe you"")

rather you can only get a lawyer when it is ""reasonable"" to expect one - taking into account that it may impede the police investigation.

and yes this is a problem even for grown men because often the facts that support a legal defence may seem irrelevant to a layman so he may not think to mention them until he sees a lawyer, at which point he may be seen to be making facts up on the spot to get out of a guilty verdict",3,banyt,2016-03-03 21:49:27,48qlsj

There's very little doubt, in my mind at least, that the SPF and the School followed protocol, and thus did nothing ""wrong"" or illegal.  However, I think many people, myself included, can see that those protocols may need revision as it seems like the protocols themselves are less than stellar.

I'm sorry I don't have actual  answers for you.  To be fair, only the SPF and government do.  Maybe if people keep asking questions like this though, they'll be compelled to answer.

48qlsj,d0lzneo,">  when the Court acquits an accused, it simply means that the Court is not convinced that he is guilty. This is because the Court does not have to go into the question of whether the accused is in fact innocent.  An acquittal (often) simply means that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

See also Chan Sek Keong's (Chief Justice, 2006-2012) remarks in 1996:

> It is based on the well known, but still misunderstood, statement that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. This assumption is contrary to reality. An accused person is charged for an offence only if there is sufficient provable and admissible evidence against him on which there is a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction. The reality is that many, if not most, accused persons are factually guilty, ie, they have done what the charges allege they have done.

The presumption of ""innocent until proven guilty"" is much weaker in Singapore than in say the US or France. In Singapore we say that Benjamin Lim hasn't been found guilty of an outrage of modesty and is *legally* innocent, though he may well be *factually* guilty.

In the US or France they'd simply say that he is innocent, *legally* and *factually* and in every other way.",1,EconCow,2016-03-04 05:58:23,d0lwapm

I think **all** official police interviews (meaning done in the station) should be video recorded and the existence of those videos should be public record (not the content, but the existence, so those with a valid legal claim would know to go asking for them if they had a right to get them.)

On a broader scale, I think the government, if it cares about Justice, should be taking steps to educate the populace about concepts like the presumption of innocence and burden of proof.  These should be covered in primary school.  

edit: I don't see anything else wrong with what they did.  Who cares if one plain clothes officer or a dozen uniformed officers came to the school.  If people don't presume guilt, then being questioned by the police wouldn't be a big issue.  I suspect that the call to the parents ""asking"" if they thought Benjamin should stay home from the trip was probably more implicitly stating ""Benjamin **should** stay home from the trip, **right?**"" but I don't know.

48qlsj,d0m1tf2,"You might be cherrypicking a little.


Elsewhere in Shanmugam's answer : 
> 16. Mr de Souza has asked if the Government supports the ""presumption of innocence"".  Sir, let there not be any doubt on this point: the presumption of innocence is an important and fundamental principle, and is one of the foundations of our Criminal Justice System. The Government is absolutely committed to upholding the presumption of innocence, as a core principle in our commitment to the Rule of Law.  There is no intention to question or qualify that principle in any way. 


also you might have misstated the understanding in the US, and i have never understood US law to mean what you say that a finding of not guilty in a court means that a court is saying that the accused is factually innocent, but he is just protected under double jeopardy: 
>18. It is possible that some confusion had arisen because this is a technical area and there is tendency in common parlance to equate a finding of ""not guilty"" in court with actual innocence.  A recent article by the Massachusetts Bar Association points out this common mistake and calls for more precise terminology. A finding of a ""not guilty"" is not to be equated with actual innocence.


furthermore, as the court in a criminal trial does not consider, as a matter of fact or law, whether the accused is innocent, it seems strange an acquital means that the court thinks the accused to be *factually* innocent.


Also, Chan Sek Keong's remarks were made when he was an AG, so he could not have represented the courts or minlaw in the capacity of a Chief Justice. they were also dealt with at length in shanmugan's speech: 
>The AG did not question that principle.  He was simply pointing out the reality of the trial system: that a person may have committed a crime but nevertheless, the Prosecution may not succeed in Court, because of a gap between the commission of a crime and the prosecution's ability to prove it in Court.  The presumption of innocence does not preclude us from acknowledging that possibility.  As I stated earlier, the Court can only look at the evidence in Court and must acquit the accused (if there is any reasonable doubt), even if the Court thinks that he probably committed the crime - because such a probability is not enough for conviction under our law.

>In other countries, everyone is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Not so in Singapore.

It is probably precisely of such attitudes that created the perfect storm leading to young Benjamin Lim's suicide.


Not sure how executive or judicial attitudes toward presumption of innocence is that related to public opinion of ""singaporeans"". In fact, whereever you look at in the world, whether in the US, france, UK, you will always find a group of locals who do 'trial by jury' and proclaim guilt or innocence without access to most of the facts.


I also don't think that anyone thinks that what happened is just, a suicide is a tragedy regardless of whether the boy is guilty or not, but I wouldn't attribute this to the 'presumption of guilt or innocence' thing, in that sense its somewhat irrelevant. even if he punched the girl, noone would want him to commit suicide - this cannot be anyone's perception of justice.

You seem to be extremely against the organisations of Singapore as well? Like have you considered the fact that perhaps the parents may have severely lectured their son about this entire incident especially when he gave an admission of guilt.

No it is not, since there are simpler ways to achieve the same outcome. 

The courts have been given the power to exempt certain individuals from capital punishment in 2012. Judges have been favouring life-imprisonment over capital punishment since then. In 2012 and 2013, there were zero cases of capital punishment.

4fy4yf,d2d1gg4,"> Can one who wants to do suicide simply bring 500 grams of Cannabis from the United States to Singapore for assisted suicide? 

From a purely hypothetical perspective, this is not an efficient way to die. Trials take time, you might be sent for a mental evaluation, and worst come to worst, the sentence might even be commuted to life in prison. This has happened even in murder cases like that of Mathavakannan Kalimuthu. Note that on death row, you only have 3 square meters of space, 2 x 30 min of exercise a day, and a bucket for washing. You can only watch TV 4 days before the execution.

> How is one killed by the death penalty in Singapore?

Hanging at Changi Prison on Friday morning. The method is specifically long drop hanging, which has the goal of breaking the neck of its victim. Decapitation can occur if the rope is not properly stretched and oiled, as in the case of Saddam Hussein. I am not sure of how efficient hanging is in Changi Prison as nobody has lived to complain.

> Is what I mentioned a common way for one who wants to suicide to do suicide?

Not at all. It puts you through too much preliminary suffering and stress, and if it goes wrong it really goes wrong (see: life in prison). Most people would prefer to die on their own terms, in a place and time of their own choosing. ",4,llosa,2016-04-23 05:56:02,4fy4yf

As we were bringing him onto the boat, his belly ruptured and covered me and 2 other guys with decomposing liquids. Had to throw away my brand new set of no. 4 after that. He only had one item in his pocket; an OCBC debit card to confirm his identity. A lot of us think it was a suicide, masked to look like an accident. Felt bad as his family was there to watch us pull the body out. Can never forget his face.",20,dliem123,2018-09-01 09:30:28,9brx06

2. Case of suicide. Person jumped and landed head first in one of those small drains along the void decks (small enough to only fit a head).

Just imagine sticking a chopstick in the ground, break it gently so that top part (legs) is still attached. Aaaand you can see the splinters (spinal cord) sticking out.

9brx06,e55ailr,"Maybe not the worst in terms of intensity but psychologically my friends pretty much agree that decomposed body is an experience is just... No words for it really. The smell, the rotting flesh, the victims face, the fluids... You will never forget it if you happen to reach the body first. If you need to grab the body to free it from the noose... Good luck washing the smell off too. Gut wrenching.

If youre talking about physical intensity all cases are quite different really. A legit RTA would probably have you busy working and toiling the entire time (30mins-1hr+??) and then you have farmland fires which you will need to attend for 24 hours, go home after your shift, and during your next duty you will go back and fight the fire some more. Its not as intense but it gets really draining after awhile honestly

But the worst is when you turnout and the incident involves a close friend. Someone I know once went to an RTA and one of his good friends got hit by a car while riding his bike. He was still alive when they got there but they werent able to rescue him in time. His officer had to restrain him and pull him out of it because he just lost it",43,Koufas,2018-09-01 01:17:55,9brx06

“Fucked up” has so many different types, such as:
1) the gruesome ones, 
2) the kind of nonsense case that makes you go ‘what the fuck?’, 
3) the kind of unexpected case that make you go ‘what the fuck!’, 
4) the emotionally taxing and gut-wrenching ones
5) the ones where you really want to do something, where really you need to do something, but you just cannot do anything
6) etc...

For most of us the suicide or violent death cases are the most gruesome. Had one guy smash open his skull and had to pick up his brains all over the floor. Definitely fucked up.

I’ve arrested people with gigabytes and terabytes of upskirt videos, as well as had cases of extremely underage sex. Could say those people are fucked up.

I’ve had people die on me. Fucking emotionally taxing, you live with it.

Unfortunately can’t share too much bc I’m sure some people I know can already recognise my repertoire of cases hahahha. 

But I think one of the most irritating things the Home Team faces is very few people comprehend and appreciate what we do, they only see the safe and pretty side of Singapore and (salt alert) the constant glorification of SAF through the media and Ah Boys to Men and what not. We literally risk our lives everyday to keep our country and fellow Singaporeans safe and most of us frontliners have more close calls with death in a few months than most Singaporeans will have in their lives, yet people only think SPF NSFs lepak and eat donuts and save cats from trees, only think SCDF NSFs sleep in station and play their phones.

9brx06,e55k7ys,"2011, SCDF 4th Division (West Region). 

My junior driver (2 of them ) were assigned to pick up about 20 firefighters from CDA who have just passed out of training and are assigned to be stationed to designated stations under 4th Div. 

Was the duty driver that day unfortunately, and received a call from station side regarding RTA(two lorries). Didn’t come across my mind that it was both my juniors who were involved, till i attended to site. 

Story short, both of them were actually competing to “race” who would return back faster along the old route towards Jalan Bahar(the Old CCk road before the expansion). 

Alighting from my vehicle, i went closer to the site, to many horror, both lorry had overturned (god knows how) and one of the firefighters had is hand pinned under the lorry. ( lucky thing not amputated). And the rest of the fireman are either flung out or all over the road. 

Upon evacuation and extraction and everything else had settled, the injured firefighter (who had his hand pinned) had to become Mess Boy in my Division. Imagine having to go through 6 months firefighting training only to return to your unit and all your ambitions destroyed because someone else’s carelessness. (Joint rescue from all 4th Division rescue equipment and ambulances and everything)

End story, both my junior driver got away scot free no punishment, no db, no offfical charges. The fireman who was injured really wanted to beat the crap of my junior for ruining his life.  Officers at that division are really bochap. ",15,arishariff,2018-09-01 05:21:04,9brx06

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. It is produced by the specialised ependymal cells in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull.

Okay, okay, okay let's pull this back to square one. It seems that you are adamant that there are people who actually dies in mid-air.

Bottom line, nobody actually dies in mid-air.

The only way you are dying ""mid-air"" is from lack of oxygen or from coldness from thousands of feet above.

226gqt,cgjt571,"Reading this piece of news inspired feelings of outrage and regret as this piece reminded me of the times I tried but failed to stand up for peers who were victims of abuse of power but was too gutless to go the whole way and complain to higher powers. If you're an NSF reading this, bear in mind that the caricatures of NS boys with happy endings in shlock movies like Ah Boys to Men superficially represent the experiences of the typical enlistee, and that there are actually many with a fragile state of mind among us. 

The guy whom you always thought was simply a little aloof/off in the head and overly perfectionist could be the next Ganesh. I'm not saying here that we should suspect every person with mild eccentricities to have mental illnesses, but that such tragedies remind us that we should always treat everyone with decency and kindness and not discriminate against them, even if you think they are weirdos.

That being said, in an environment where you have an iron rice bowl and a guaranteed replenishment of labour~~slaves~~ every few months, its little wonder that such an environment draws out the malice within the people in power every time, which is why stories of abuse of power among NSFs are so common. The people doling out the extras simply view it as a tool to crush the spirits of the men and to ensure there won't be anymore trouble, because really, why bother to be a decent person and go the extra mile to motivate the men and find out their problems when they don't get paid anymore then what they already get? The prevailing mentality is to just throw extras at the problem till it goes away, which ironically worked too well in this case.

And fuck the guy who gave 14 extras, which btw is illegal to do so in the army, iirc there are a maximum number of extras that can be given to men, even officers do not get that many and usually get 7. Lieutenant Fucker here is probably one of those types who slowly accumulate offences against an NSF and then just give them all in one shot just to fuck with them or to have a strong enough case to send them to DB. Lieutenant Fucker's colleagues who did not flag out Ganesh's mental illness were almost as complicit in pushing him to suicide as this sort of thing should be discovered in superior interviews.

On another note, I'm surprised by the fact that this news hasn't been more widely reported as this is a grossly egregious case of misuse of power and negligency given that it pushed the guy to suicide. So far I have only seen it in the tabloid the New Paper.",22,aejhaefg,2014-04-05 02:41:36,226gqt

226gqt,cgjtc1s,"You are not wrong about the fresh docs serving their last year of NS thing, most of them are there to fill up the numbers of MOs and have almost no practical experience at all. The thing is that mental conditions are often flagged out, esp in cases with solid patient histories like Ganesh's. Unfortunately, some like Ganesh occasionally fall through the cracks. 

The real tragedy here is not of a guy who fell through the cracks in the system and consequently suffered as a result of bureaucratic fuckups, akin to tragedies where people with heart conditions or asthma are posted to combat vocations/NSmen with hidden problems dying during IPPT as they over exert themselves to avoid wasting time at RT. Spinning the story as one where Ganesh was simply a victim of circumstances greatly diminishes the enormity of the abuses and mistreatment leading to his suicide, which is the real tragedy here. The kind of questions posed in the article 

> All this begs these questions: Should schizophrenics be allowed to serve in the army even as clerks and or administrative assistants? How should someone with schizophrenia be treated in the army? Did the Singapore Armed Forces and MINDEF provide counselling to the parents of the bereaved? And if the armed forces and MINDEF did not provide Ganesh’s distraught family members with counselling, why not? Also, what action did SAF and MINDEF take to ensure that Ganesh did not succumb to a negative mindset?

is the typical shit stirring, vindictive mentality that Singaporeans have in the event of a tragedy. It does not help Ganesh's family get the justice they deserve, nor does it help anyone who is currently being abused. It completely ignores the fact that Ganesh **was stable before enlisting**, and hence for all intents and purposes, would not have been treated as someone being of unsound mind by the Army. The point of this whole investigation should be focused on the abuses of power and the neglect of the officers in not highlighting the deteriorating mental condition of their man, but instead doing their best to exacerbate his steady descent into schizophrenia. 

It seems to me that the enormity of the crimes by Ganesh's superiors is something that is glossed over by the media, and all it is doing is putting its usual spin of ""suay guy who fell through bureaucratic crack"" and doing its fucking worthless after action review style of articles, completely ignoring the circumstances of the real tragedy here.

I slightly disagree with you here. Such tragedies should serve as the spur for the authorities to introduce checks into the system such as more anonymous 360 interviews along with the regular staff interviews, and harsher punishments for instances of abuse of authority(dismissal or DB). Tougher regulations will ensure commanders don't take the endlessly renewing supply of labour for granted.

In this case however I am not optimistic due to the inherent stigma against mental illnesses in Singapore, and the circumstances of Ganesh's death would probably be cast as work stress brought about by his OCD. Which is clearly bullshit as he was marked from the start and his superiors ignored his history of mental illness, and did not ask about any underlying problems he could have had.

226gqt,cgkmmc7,"As far as I'm aware, this case was not brought to mainstream attention and only featured in the tabloid the New Paper. As to why, I can only speculate. Perhaps the fact that the army keeps harping upon Ganesh's history of mental illness to detract the abuse and mistreatment he encountered from the narrative concerning the circumstances of his suicide renders this not newsworthy, as it is viewed as a case of a ""psycho who killed himself, no surprises there"". Or more unlikely, it is simply the government machinery at work again to hide the fuckups of the SAF from the public.

**EDIT**: Seriously though, more people should be reminded of this. The tales of mismanagement and abuses of power towards NSFs may have been flogged about the SAF more freely than Singapore's spending on defence, but we must always be reminded of the fact that these things can lead to tragedy and can cost innocent lives. **Laughing it up and telling people to suck thumb is no panacea for guys like Ganesh.** **Upvote to create visibility for this story, not because you think, ""fuck SAF"", but to remind people of the need for decency towards each other, especially if you are in a position of power.**

Unless you're not a surplus tiny cog in a big machine that does not necessarily need more tiny cogs to go faster,there is no incentive to do better at a job where most of the people get paid $2+ per hour and have to do overtime w/o pay(guard duty). In my time in NS, I was one of those who saw no reason to go the extra mile and would only do what was minimally required of me to avoid punishment. I continued this behaviour until one day I asked my friend whom people viewed as one of those ""siao on"" types , why bother at all to work hard in this kind of shitty environment which shows little reward to your hard work? 

His response was that he did it so as not to lose his competitive edge later on in life, which I found to be especially true in the years after army. Work ethic is something that needs to be maintained in all facets of your life and is not something that can be switched on when you book out and switched off when you book in. Many including myself convinced ourselves that as this was a Fucking Waste of Time, it was OK to slack off and be unproductive since our efforts would go to waste anyway other than to make our superiors look good, when deep down we simply had the urge to be lazy. And this laziness is an insidious thing which eventually permeates all aspects of your life, especially since you ""practise"" being lazy for the majority of the time you are in camp.

So to those who think we are fortunate to go to NS because it molds us into better, tougher people, I say that you are wrong, because when you encounter the drudgery of the semi bureaucracy that is the SAF, the red tape surrounding the Sisyphean activities you partake in will draw in close to suffocate you gradually. It is the ultimate trap for young men at the stage of their lives when they have the most ambition. And to those in somewhat mundane vocations who had a positive NS experience, power to you for maintaining a positive mindset and keeping sane by finding meaning even in the most pointless of activities knowing it will benefit you in the future, be it in your vocations as clerk, rifleman, storeman, signaller, medic, or even the lifeguards who clean the camp swimming pools.

The proceeds from the SSGS are then invested by the government, presumably in higher yielding investments which are of higher risk. What exactly do they invest in? It doesn't really matter to a CPF member as our exposure is to the Singapore Government, not these individual investments. What this means in plain English then is that, it doesn't matter if any of the government's specific investments doesn't pan out, so long as the Singapore government itself doesn't default, CPF members will get our money back.

These are all public information. So if you believed OP without checking on this, you are part of the reason why fake news is becoming so prevalent.

But I digress, effectively what this means is that the government is using its ability to withstand the losses from changes in the financial cycle to invest in riskier investments and then pay a portion of those returns to CPF members who should not be expected to and may not be able to take on the same level of risk. The Government can take the hit from paper losses on its portfolio at a specific point in time of an economic crisis but a retiree needing the funds for day to day needs cant.

Now as to whether the government itself will default, the consensus from credit rating agencies (see the triple A ratings) and markets alike is that it's extremely unlikely. Is it theoretically possoble? Yes. But again, the consensus is that this is extremely unlikely. Even in the event that the Government loses shit loads of money on its investments, it can still go to the markets to borrow money at low interest rates before defaulting on its debt including the SSGS to CPF and in turn CPF members. That may need some change in law though as currently the government issues bonds for policy reasons (can google if interested) and not to finance its expenditure (which is what most governments issue bonds for). There are therefore legal restrictions on how it can use the money from bonds issuance and the general idea is that it can only be used for repaying the bonds and interest).

Bottom line is this - on whether the government would default, would you trust the opinion of the markets and professional rating agencies or that of a incoherent poster on reddit. Both are not perfect, but I certainly know which has more expertise.

There's reasons why government backed investments are triple A. There's also reasons why some countries backed are not.

The statement is ""solid guarantee"". By reading it and understanding the implied meaning, it means not 100% but very good chances.

Back by government also means it's tied very closely with the countries economy.

I became much more disciplined and improved my grades to Ace my results in the remaining years. I felt I became into a more attractive person physically because I started exercising, and I built on my character and became a more interesting person to hang out with.

In my pictures with my friends now, I’m happy with the way I look, how happy I am. I’m confident with myself again where I can strike conversation with strangers and meet new people.

If he did admit it to someone who is prepared to testify to that effect, or if for example he texted you apologies etc, you'll probably have at least something to go on.  Whether or not you have a case for outrage of modesty largely also depends on if your relationship was sexual already.

First step would be to gather your available evidence, then make a police report.  You can make it on your own since you're a legal adult.  If the AG decides not to prosecute you can still bring a private prosecution but that will be at your own expense.",5,samglit,2016-04-08 22:44:30,4dv4av

The road to recovery is long and not easy, but seriously can be done. If you are willing to try, see a doctor about antidepressants. But it is possible to fix yourself without also.

Cut yourself some slack at work for the next 6 months or 1 year, you need to be prepared that recovering fully can take as much time as that, and until then you may not be performing 100% optimally.

Go out, explore and try to find new things to enjoy. Start small, and take care of yourself. Get enough sleep. Exercise can truly give you a boost in the hours after the workout. Discover new things you can enjoy doing if the old ones don't satisfy you anymore. Make it a point to try new and novel things, as hard as it can be.

Watch a movie every weekend. Pick up a new hobby if you're up to it. Spend time going out to do something new if you can.

Most of all, reach out to people for help and form new relationships or maintain old ones. Ask your friends out. Ask coworkers out if you can. Talking to someone everyday, it will do wonders for you. It's nice that you have a husband who loves you and whom you love. I would start there. That's already a huge advantage you have that you should make use of, many of us don't have someone special yet.

Gradually you will feel the joy of life returning. It comes very slowly but you will notice a real change in months.

Obviously stressed out and then some higher up politics dragged me in. 

Then it was 24/7 on standby whenever the job needs me. I do everything - system projects, operational risk, audit, fixing computers, moving computers, if the lights spoil it's my problem. Etc. 

Then facing the toughest boss with the foulest mouth. And a bunch of dealers who would curse and swear at you anything goes wrong. Which is frequent because I'm obviously inexperienced for this. I'm expected to learn the entire treasury function and leadership at the same time. 

Then having teammates who are simply not happy that I'm in charge (like I had a choice) and started workplace bullying like ganging up against me or spreading vicious rumors. 

I spent 3 years working like this. I became terrified of people. I clamped up. I ate lunch alone for the whole time. I had numerous breakdowns at work where I'd hide in the toilet and cry.

When you off yourself, who will be crying over your body. I believe you have loved ones or friends that will be sad to see you go. And if you are posting here because you have no close friends to talk to, I'm here. I'll be sad to see you go. Here I am fighting to stay alive and if you die, you prove to me that all my efforts to keep myself alive is futile.

Work is stressful. Even when I work, I feel the joy of cooking, but the joy I feel is not enough to counteract the stress I have at work sometimes. Fuck it. Leave the stress of work for work time. End work, forget the stress. Bringing the stress with you home from work means you are still at work. Company not paying you to stress about work when you at home leh. 

Life gets better. There will be ups and downs. Now what you feel is the new workplace stress. But now is different. You got experience from your old workplace. Means you pick up things faster. You learn faster. Things will improve. Build better relationships with your new colleagues. Occasionally buy kopi for them. First priority get to know tour jobscope inside out. Then go learn what others jobscope is like. Then see how you can help them with your experience and knowledge. 

Go go GO!!!",13,ElphabaPfenix,2015-06-08 08:35:00,cryibzd

Anti-depressants can help, though not everyone needs them.

38wzs6,crzl2nz,"I definitely hope you give a visit to the psychiatrist a shot, as well as express your concern about antidepressants. What you said about seeing things is quite worrying and seems more serious than depression alone (despite it not happening anymore).

About anti depressants, if you're worried about side effects, just understand that drugs for ANY illness affect different people differently, and drugs aren't put on the market if they hurt more than heal. I've personally had meds where I got every side effect listed by my practitioner, but there are always alternatives that a psychiatrist will be very familiar with!

In my experience, it is also a relief just to have a professional tell you: ""yes, you have anxiety and depression."" It took away a lot of insecurity and shame, which definitely can help.

Psychiatrists also have a ton of reliable resources like therapists whom they trust. It's not all drugs :). I'd always go to a proper medical doctor as the first step, and that's what psychiatrists are.

38wzs6,cs0830p,"Well there was a psychologist and a team of psychiatrists who visited daily. The latter would be monitoring your meds, talk to you in general and then there's the psychologist who does it more comprehensively. Which is something I really appreciated since going for say monthly or weekly therapy is exhausting and draining. But in this residential setting, it's daily and you just retire to bed or do something else. This was mostly CBT and a bit of DBT, I wish I could've have learned the latter though but I am doing that myself now, several years later. 

Aside from that the nurses also organised a bunch of other stuff like art therapy, music, cooking (for the more able ones). And well being around people with other afflictions also, strangely, helped a lot. If you watched shows like ""Girl, Interrupted"", it was nothing like that. There were schizophrenics, there were old people with dementia, there were the bipolar ones. Puts everything in perspective. Without the illness, I am at the base a sociable person who is curious about others so I interacted a lot with the other patients. It's different for others of course and this might not be the best thing but I found that no longer isolating myself helped a lot. Plus the hospital was a very, very safe environment. You have your meals all-ready for you, the nurses are kind and pleasant well of course as long as you don't bother them and are aware (I put this here because some patients were more destructive and the sad fact is that some nurses reacted negatively. they are only human of course. There was a male patient that was starting to deteriorate and as he got more violent, he was taken away to IMH. That was rather scary.) 

I was suffering from severe clinical depression, by that point the only person I talked to or even interacted with was the family counsellor. Not saying that being warded was an instant panacea but it did help tremendously, the rest of the months that followed was difficult but I could feel more human again.

4ihhcy,d2y9ie7,"Was a medic at Central, aside from the usual gory trauma, suicide, collapse cases, drowned bodies, and old people medical emergencies, we also had the hilarious/sad stuff that happened on drunk Fri/Sat nights.

Many drunk/passed out people, but funniest one was at the lobby of an apartment building around Pomo. Entered the lobby, me and crew immediately hit with the stench of human faeces. Look around, see a dismayed looking security guard pointing to his chair and desk in the middle of the lobby. Apparently one of the residents got too drunk while out, came home and decided that he needed to poop really badly. Decided to pull down his pants and sit on the first toilet-looking object he saw. Turned out to be the guard's chair. 

As well all know from experience, beer shits are never solid, and he exploded in a disgustingly accurate halo of diarrhea around the security chair and desk. Worst part was, we has so drunk that he didn't know what was going on and we had to go up to his unit to ask someone to come take care of him.

We go up to unit and find out that he's 18 years old, and together with his mom, little sister, and maid, had an awkward ride down the elevator to show them where their kid was.

Police arrived much much later, gagged at the smell, took down some info and gtfo'd pretty quick. To this day I still don't know how I stood in that lobby with the smell for like 45mins plus. I chalk it down to sleep deprivation.

Beyond that, I've also been involved in a couple of high profile cases around the Central area. Was one of the crew who attended to the victims of the Sarawak slashers, that was a talking point for a while.

BTW if you watch the recent channel 8 drama about paramedics, you might see my cameo as I was assigned to watch over the equipment while mediacorp was filming and was roped in as an extra.

4ihhcy,d2zib85,"Not SCDF but was an Air Force driver. Was first attached as a runway driver/inspector and subsequently ambulance driver. 

First week of attachment, F5 front wheels was unable to fully lock. Had to watch and pray in real time, looking at the plane try to land, it's wheels disintegrating with a ton of sparks, walkie talkies going silent and fire engines chasing after the plane in case it catches fire.

Subsequently got attached to medical center which also acted as medical centre for East side for night cases. Seeing my fair shares of people wanting to chao keng, their face changing and protesting when doctors resort to putting them on drips for an entire day to discourage such tactics. 

A regular kicking up a huge ruckus when he found out he was HIV positive. 

Old aunties and uncles working around the airbase as cleaners and odd jobs refusing medical aid despite vomiting blood, signs of heat strokes etc fearing they have to pay :(

Looking at a technician who collapsed and on the verge of death, body limping on a fighter jet while he was doing a routine inspection, looking helplessly while people were trying help as there was just no safe way to get him down quickly to administer medical aid. He eventually passed away. 

My first test came when a regular from a squadron deep inside the base suffered a heart attack. Brain behaving in an extreme heightened mode trying to rush him to hospital, using prior experience to pre-emptively communicate with control tower using runway hoping to shave off precious seconds, relentlessly using the sirens and wails on the ambulance to make drivers get out of the way, ignoring SAF ""safety"" driving regulations to make it to the hospital. Managed to made it. Doctors told me if we were a few minutes later, he wouldn't have made it. 

People like to make fun of drivers or even NSFs in general, saying how slack they are, how stupid they can be and all. I'd like to think that when you delegate heavy responsibilities to adolescents and young adults, making people who are only 18 or so drive Class 4 vehicles and crucial vehicle platforms like ambulances when such jobs tend to be done by people who are much older in the private sectors, making them involved in matters considering life and death, there need to be more understanding and appreciation for such thankless jobs. Most of us who seen and experienced these unfortunate incidents are able to move on with life and become a stonger/better person, but I've seen colleagues who became scarred, like a piece of them has disappeared, some who has recurring nightmares and require psychiatric help. 

Ultimately though, after coming back from a long Europe trip, I believe that NS helped to toughen up the perspectives of an average Singaporean male, despite how apathetic we might seem in daily life.

Rushed to get the stretcher and brought him to the medical centre for the MO to examine. He was subsequently sent to the A&E department and we found out that he tore his ACL through a freak accident.

1. Guy dislocated his arm serving a tennis ball.

3. Man refused to call out to relatives outside the toilet because he didn't want them to see his balls

4. Guy has a distended stomach, the moment we turn him sideways he crop dusts my paramedic in a fart cloud. 

5. Guy with big balls demanding we look at his big balls because it hurts

6. Guy calls because he is having a tooth ache.

7. Guy gets hit by a car, asks if his tattoo is ok (Ultimate Ahbeng)


Worst cases

1. Middle of night shift C-case

2. RTA where the person had her leg shaved down to the bone, she was wailing in pain then got really quiet. 

3. C-case where wife dies in front of husband and us, we were scrambling around his small house and he was destroying it telling us over and over again ""Step anywhere is ok, just save her life"" He at first didn't know she was dead and kept calling to her. Really fucked with my concentration. Never liked to hear a grown man cry, she died. From smoking at the window, to a breathless call text to death in a matter of minutes. Death can hit anytime and without warning, even after a trip for 2 at Krabi. (The only time I truly wanted to bring someone back to life)

4. Old man attempted suicide but was talked down by friends, spent an hour talking him away from killing himself, the police told us he either went with the ambulance to a hospital or get detained at the detention centre (He wanted to die because his wife died a year ago and his children didn't want to see him). He finally got around to coming with us on the stretcher. Just as he sat down the police told us they were taking over. It just broke me to think that after all I told him about how we were going to take care of him and give him a warm hospital bed, the police will be locking him away like a criminal for god knows how many hours all because he couldn't stand living anymore. (I don't blame SPF, they have their protocol we have ours)

5. One of my first few shifts, this one fucked with my mind to this day and I honestly do my best to make sure I am prepared for every case now because of it. A normal call becomes a C-case, I run down the stairs to get the LUCAS but take time to find it (First few shifts), get lost on my way up in my panic as to what the case is. By the time I get up my Paramedic pronounces the  guy died and it's a DOA. I figured she just did it to cover our asses because of how long I took. I spent the next 30 minutes listening to the whole family cry. Really felt like shit for a long time. It was my fault.

Touching cases

1. Small boy and mother on a bicycle hit by a car, boy through his tears demands we look after his mother and makes sure she was ok. He was 6ish.

2. Maternity (Yay) You enter the hospital and unlike a C-case the doctors have smiles on their faces. The blood scrubs out eventually but the feeling of bringing life into this world is the best.

I've seen some weird shit during medical boards and I've had soldiers coming in and telling my doctor stupid reasons just to get out of training during consultation hours (""I feel sleepy when I put on my helmet"" anyone?)

Anyway, so one day we had a high flyer presiding over the medical board for the month in my medical centre and we're just wrapping up and I was looking forward slacking off in front of the TV when the COS of a unit rushes in and tells my MO in front of the high flyer, 
COS: ""sir sir, we got a suicidal soldier."" 

MO asks, is he in a safe position? (i.e. not on top of building) 

COS: yes. 

MO: okay bring him to me, I'll talk to him.

COS: ok. (runs off, and then back pedals.)

COS: Sir, i don't think we can pry him out from the General Store, he's just banging his head on the wall and he's got his hands gripped on two shelves in between him.

MO (to me): Get the MO bag, we go to him.

High flyer: I would like to stay and watch.

MO (in his most garang tone): Sir no problem, please do, sir.

I go to the cupboard, and realises I don't know where the key is. So I broke down the door. like literally, took screwdriver snap the door open. Grabs the bag, ran out.
Coming out, I got to the door, and we headed out and saw 3 of the biggest sergeants in the unit carrying this skinny ass dude (who has a record of malingering) in.

We brought him into the treatment room, and the 3 specs are sitting on him because he's trying to escape. My doctor told me to lock the doors of the treatment room, and then we release him. He starts running around screaming that he wants to die, he will blow up the whole camp while my doctor calmly fills up a syringe of valium. He turns around, seeing the soldier running around. By now he's exasperated, (and the high flyer, obviously having a whale of a time watching this comical mess) and the soldier runs towards him. My MO clothes line him; turns him around and jabs him in the ass with the valium.

We left him on the floor for awhile to monitor his vital signs before I sent him to IMH in the SAF ambulance. Had the 3 specs in the ambulance with me just in case he turns violent but he just kept muttering he wants to blow us all up and we can re-incarnate with him.

Former radiographer (someone who take medical images for diagnosis), used to work at a local general hospital. 

So, at several occasions, I had to x-ray:

* Severed arm at mid-humerus (mid-upper arm) in a clear plastic bag with ice cubes at 4am in Emergency. Woke me up completely. Had to x-ray the arm to let the doctor decide if it's prudent to re-attach the limb. I also had to x-ray the poor dude's stump of an arm later on.
* Foreign worker's thigh which got punctured by a thick metallic industrial rod (the 1.2m-ish rod was still there when the patient was pushed in). I could see the bedding from the other side of the thigh through the gaping thigh-hole. It was surreal. Most delicate handling required. 
* Numerous cases of gangrenous pus-producing diabetic cellulitis swollen foots. Most of them came wrapped up in NTUC plastic bags. You can see the pus-liquid dancing inside the plastic bag sometimes. That smell is something to remember - especially I had to squat down to ask the patient to step on the x-ray imaging plate and touch/position the foot properly. 
* Numerous cases of foreign workers' amputated fingers from industrial accidents. Poor things, foreign workers. 
* A couple of instances seeing patients drawing their last breathes in front of me, just when I was about to x-ray them. Usually at emergency resuscitation room. 
* Orthopedic surgeries in the operating theaters - all those hammering, pulling, fixing, straightening and screwing of bony parts, plus the collateral gore.

I had a funny feeling when I heard the slamming sound.  Went to the general office. One student tried to stop the door from slamming.  Punched his hand into the glass.  Slit his forearm just after wrist to near elbow.

There was blood everywhere.  On the floor and a small pool in a chair. A teacher was try stop the bleeding by holding the cut close.  Against all training, I applied a tourniquet with a bandage.  Used another to close the wound and raise the arm like Statue of Liberty. The blood slowed to a trickle.

I was terrified of tying it too tightly and causing him to loose his arm.  So I had to loosen it periodically, at the cost of more dripping blood.

Actually I don't have to loosen his tourniquet if the ambulance arrived sooner.  When someone calls 995 at a school, the police turned up first.  The officer took one step and noped out immediately.

Had a no duff heat stroke case while being deployed out on BCS. We were sitting around having cup noodles when we had a call for no duff. Vehicle came in, and we all tossed our noodles out when my MO opened the door and his unconscious body fell on him.

We went through something like 6 bags of IV, one malay medic saying last rites for him, one medic doing CPR, and thankfully we had a A&E specialist and a staff nurse with us on the team. Both men was the calmest in the tent. Everyone was running around like mad men. Couldn't find the rectal thermometer, couldn't find the thermometer sheath when we decided to use the normal thermometer on his ass. Didn't have enough ice and water to cool him down (he was pushing 42-43 degrees) so we busted out our personal stash of ice boxes filled with ice cream and coca cola, 100plus cans to cool his body down.

Battalion S3 came down, CO came down, every one of the senior combat officers were shitting bricks in their pants at the entrance of the BCS, repeating ""please evacuate now"".

Stabilized him, MO and staff nurse sent him to hospital, came back with KFC for the entire team. shiok. MO and Staff nurse medic also said that the hospital nurses gave them a WTF look when they saw ice cold cans of drinks at the dude's groin and armpits, magnum ice creams at his neck.

P/S:
When u use the rectal thermometer on someone who is fully passed out, he won't feel anything. Its the surest way to check if the fella is trying to pull a fast one on you.

To the SAF combat medics, we usually don't respond to real cases, especially on exercises. But when others deploy for exercises; we deploy for real. Never forget that. Your reservist mates rely on you to save their lives if anything happens to them. Pack your stuff, know where you keep your shit.

IMH is not prison, you have a record but it is inaccessible to everyone (Barring a few circumstances - for e.g. court-mandated order). You make an IMH record sounds like a criminal record.

I have an IMH ""record"". When I was in primary school, I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia. After years of therapy, medicine and coupled with coping lessons done by team of counsellors - I can proudly say that I am high functioning. Discharged about 13 years ago.

I am a teacher now, no one is any wiser. When I get stress, the symptoms do show up once in a while, that is when I have to kick my ""coping lessons"" into overdrive. 

I was never violent anyway. More of a person whose mind is not located in the body. 

So relax. It is important not to stress about the stigma. Just focus on the therapy. 

So far, the civil service in Singapore has one of the best support for mentally ill individuals. I have quite a few colleagues who have mental illness. It is always accepted as an illness. You are sick, you work on it and get better. Then come back when you are better. No one really bothers as long as you don't ""keng"" and ""eat snake"" lol.

u have to declare your medical condition/history in the job application form. If not the employer will ask you how come you served as a clerk in NS and ask about your pes status, you can't lie that you have no illness as you're a PES E Clerk. also, the job application form (in most cases) will ask you about your ns rank and vocation. my current company asked for NS rank and vocation in the application form, can't remember about the NS PES though.

as for government sector, everything in government is surely linked and when u want to apply for govt job, u will be scrutinized from head to toe. but u can try.. so to answer ur question, there's no definite answer, maybe some companies will judge u for ur medical history or condition (we live in a judgmental society) and will probably assume u chao keng even if u think u didn't thus lowering ur chance of being hired.

NS matter or doesn't matter etc.. it's hard to say. Some companies don't really care about what you did in NS (but you still have to fill in your NS information in the job application form), some companies will ask for your Certificate of Service and look at it as an experience or as a way to assess your character (this is true for government sector, virtually all government sectors will ask for your COS hence the scrutiny from head to toe I mentioned earlier), some companies won't even ask for it and they're less likely to ask for it as you're older and have other work experiences to add to your resume. 


I have a cousin who didn't serve NS, he got PES F due to some blood clot related issue. He even requested for PES E during CMPB checkup but apparently the MO thinks his condition is so debilitating that even a clerical role in NS isn't suitable for him. I don't believe he is a second class citizen as he is still fully capable of working and his condition does not impede his ability to do the job he wants. It's not like he was exempted from NS due to a mental illness, if that's the case then we can probably establish the fact that he WILL have difficulties in looking for jobs. 

In short: Just do your best in NS and your studies, your COS grading will affect your employment prospect in the government sector. As for your illness, I don't know, there's no definite answer. Maybe some companies are more careful about people who are permanent PES E/F due to a mental illness, some won't as long as you prove yourself to be capable, so you should have something to back you up in case they do talk or question about your illness. (E.g, school grades, portfolio, work experience, testimonial etc..)
