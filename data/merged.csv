8vgrob,GramTooNoob,"Update from the Depressed Asshole About 3-4 months ago, I posted on reddit about my situation and depressed I am about the future. Link - [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/868w56/depressed\_about\_future\_prospects/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/868w56/depressed_about_future_prospects/)

Well, I finally left the house today to for the first time in months (Thanks Amazon Groceries!) to seek help and I thought I would post an update here since some of you cared - I think. The doctor didn't think I have hit the threshold to be considered depressed, but I need help with emotional control and some therapy could be good for me. I am open to that option, but its going to take awhile for an appointment slot so let's see. No money, can't complain when waiting for a subsidy slot. Nonetheless, I am prescribed with Fluoxetine for a month to help my mood.

To be honest, I am still very adverse to getting help because of social workers and the horrible experience from some ppl in my last post. That might or might not have been my fault, but when I took certain advice and was told by ""official channel"" to come back only when I have run out of money, it feels very soul crushing. I feel like going to the casino and gamble my savings away. Who knows, I might become a millionaire overnight. Nonetheless, I have made a personal note to ignore all social workers henceforth. They only know how to talk, and fulfill their self gratification to do one good deed per day. There were some nice people though, but they disappeared down the road... don't ask me why. I don't know why. But it just goes to cement my opinion that ""help"" is talk only.

Truth be told, I actually tried to kill myself in May after receiving more headache news. I was so disappointed in having to do anymore and everything myself. I stayed awake the entire night, waiting to slit my wrist the next morning in bed after overdosing on aspirin for blood thinning. I had a plan to ensure that I was dead when anyone found me. The sudden bout of despair was so real, I spent hours crying alone in the toilet. But the plan didn't execute, only because I couldn't order aspirin on amazon and I couldn't get another replacement for blood thinner. I have no interest in ""attempting"" then calling the ambulance myself. I want to die, I don't want help because all help as so superficial. The reality that even trying to kill myself is a burden eventually set in, and I decided to sought medical help. I suppose if I am going to die, I might as well figure out what I am suffering from and explore the options before dying. At least, I can tell God that... well, it didn't help.

Anyway, this is just an update. I don't really have anything to add. There hasn't been any real positive update and I have buried myself in games as a distraction and escape. At least in game, effort = opportunities. Unlike real life, no paper degree? No opportunities. Well to be fair, I did had one opportunity at my last job, but I burned the bridge when I resigned in a rage. Well, not going to matter if I am going to die anyway. That's it from me, maybe I will update again or maybe I won't. I don't really know what's the point, and I assume the reader would feel the same as well. All the best to everyone and thanks for being supportive previously. Sorry I can't help myself, I don't know what I don't know. I still have money for living expenses for a year more, so don't worry. The budget is just very strict, so I feel a little sad when groceries shopping. Feels like the kid who wants a cotton candy at the park but was told ""NO! NO YOU DON""T!"". Where is the money from? *Ah, that's the money I saved for my degree.* You know, the one I dropped halfway because my Dad got a stroke. So ya, advising me to get a job, save some money and do my degree is very good advise. I totally appreciate it, feels so true! I am so looking forward to scrapping money again for a degree!

2rmxjc,skilletstove,"Don't know how to deal with offensive comments without affecting my work relationships Throwaway! I just want to know there are people who have been in the same situation so I don't feel so completely alone with my convictions. I've recently graduated and am now in the corporate workforce - and I get it. I really, reaaaally do. There's a certain set of rules and norms when working in a Singaporean corporate environment, and I can't expect the same freedom to speak my mind I was afforded in university ..and which was sort of encouraged in the particular course I took. 

But I like to think there are some issues I can't not stand for... because if I didn't fight for them, I'd just become an empty, spineless ghost of a person and then I might as well quit before that happens. It first started quite innocuously at a casual meeting with a big group of people from my department and a few others we worked closely with. Long story short, the group made a round of derogatory remarks/jokes about homosexuals and homosexuality in general, and I didn't feel comfortable about that at all. I strongly believe sexuality does not *need* to be gendered and when I was in college I've always had the prerogative to debate and speak my mind quite aggressively on the issue whenever it came up. But at that moment I laughed. I laughed because everyone else was laughing and I didn't want to be *that guy* in my new work circle. I was also wary about fitting in, being a wet blanket and causing unnecessary conflict..especially when my boss didn't seem to mind it.

It felt like intense betrayal because I had close friends and family who'd struggled with the social stigma of being different and I knew how innocent jokes could end up hurting people in a very real way. And yet I wasn't doing anything, in fact my silence had contributed in my acceptance of what they had said. For days after I couldn't stop thinking about what I should have said, or worked out scenarios where I could keep silent but walk away in quiet protest. It would have been a luxury to do so when in reality I wasn't ready to lose my new job by doing something overt. I thought about approaching HR but I knew enough about their priorities to know that they'll just insinuate that I shouldn't cause any trouble. 

It's a conundrum because I do have work-friends (that I enjoy otherwise), but at the same time these are friends I can't escape or come to blows with if I find their views objectionable because we have to work together. I hate myself each time I end up keeping quiet or nodding my head to something I don't agree with and it's gotten to a point where I've become slightly depressed because I can't be the same person I was in college, who stood up for what I thought was right. I can't decide what I should do since the many Singaporeans are pretty close-minded and I suspect homophobia is highly explicit anywhere or at least accepted all around, so there's no point thinking of getting out. Campaigning for awareness within my company will definitely not be sanctioned or approved either since we wouldn't want any public backlash. 

Has anyone else been in the same situation? How did you deal with it?"
17zs3x,mburg777,"PAP MP Inderjit Singh shares his objections to the recently released White Paper on Population Speech by Mr Inderjit Singh,
MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC

On the White Paper on Population

Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the White Paper on Population.

While the report has some compelling arguments for the 6.9m population figure projected, we all know it is based mainly on economic considerations. Had we focused on things like building a cohesive nation with a strong national identity, the outcome would likely be very different.

I feel the time has come for us to find a better balance between economic growth and social cohesion and yes there will have to be tradeoffs of economic growth but I would rather trade some of these for a cohesive, united nation where people feel taken care of at home and are confident of their future. I am not saying we go for low or no growth. Instead I am willing to adjust my growth expectations for a more comfortable life for all Singaporeans. I am confident we will still be able to pursue respectable economic growth when companies and Singaporeans are faced with a situation of tightened labour availability by focusing on improving ourselves through productivity and higher value capabilities. Finland and other small nations have done, we can do it too.

Our past decade of rapid population growth has already created too many problems which need to be solved first before we take the next step. I call on the government to take a breather for five years, solve all the problems created by the past policies of rapid economic and population growth. We can safely say that we have failed to achieve the goal set by the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, of a Swiss standard of living for most Singaporeans, except for the higher income Singaporeans including foreigners who just recently decided to make Singapore their home. So I call for a breather in this quest of growing the population and focus on improving the lives of Singaporeans and achieve that promised Swiss Standard of living for most Singaporeans first before we plan our next growth trajectory.

Taking Care of the Singaporean Core
I have a big issue with the number of PRs and new citizens we are planning to add to our population. I don't see the necessity to be as aggressive when the key consideration of the population growth is the economy. We have already added too many new citizens and PRs and need time for integration and social cohesion to happen. Looking at history, our population grew from around 2.4m in 1980 to 3m in 1990 and then to 4m in 2000, reaching 5.3m last year. Just looking at the resident population alone, we grew the numbers from 2.3m in 1980 to 2.7m in 1990, 3.3m in the year 2000 and then to 3.8m last year. So in the last decade we added more than 1m to the resident population, and the in last 25 years, which is close to 1 generation of Singaporeans, we have added another close to 50% more to our resident population. I believe this must be the fastest rate of population growth in the world and I feel this is just too much for us to comfortably go back and build a national identity and social cohesion which was progressing very well till the 1990s. Adding another 500,000 to 800,000 more PRs and citizens as proposed by the white paper will be disastrous and add to our already difficult infrastructure and social problems.

If it is economic growth we want then let's just adopt the Dubai model of a transient workforce which will give us a lot more flexibility to manage numbers in the longer term. On PRs, today we already have too many of them and they are enjoying full citizen privileges without the citizens' responsibilities. For example;
- Far too many PR boys who skip NS when they turn 18. After enjoying the privileges they have a choice of not doing NS and then leave the country. I believe only around 30% of all PR boys do NS today. Well, our Singapore sons don't have a choice but to do NS, it is an office not to do it.
- PR children study at their International system schools sticking to their home cultures.
- PRs can buy HDB flats from the open market driving prices of HDB flats too high.

So I urge the government to reduce the number of projected new PRs and citizens just to the population replacement levels and be more selective and differentiate their privileges from citizens. I have a few suggestions for the government to consider;

• The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round, reduce fees for Singaporeans not just increase for PRs.

• PR children must be made do national service - it should no longer be a choice and we should make it an offence if they don’t do it. We should not grant PRs to families who don’t commit their sons to National Service.

• HDB - if a PR buys a HDB flat from the open market, charge a levy of say $50k and allow them to sell only to Singaporeans. If the PR takes up citizenship within 5 years, we can refund the levy.

• Children of PRs should be made to study in our national schools so that we increase the chance of integrating them at the next generation.

• On the employment front, it is time we implement a Singaporean first hiring policy like what is done in some developed countries like Canada. Companies should show proof first that they were not able to fill a position with a Singaporean before they are allowed to hire a foreigner.

• Reconsider the dependents policy - I have come across a number of cases where our targeted one child from China brings in 2 parents who then bring 2 parents each as their dependents - Net is that we gain one young one child who we brought in for our future but also inherited 6 older people - making our ageing population issue worse not better.

I feel the differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens.

This brings me to the point of how many Singaporeans are feeling about the presence of such huge numbers of new citizens, PRs and foreigners amongst our midst. First for housing - there is no doubt that the influx of foreigners in Singapore has driven up our property prices. PRs are buying HDB flats from the open market which drives up prices.

Just last week I had a dialogue session with my private estates residents and one of my residents complained that a new citizens recently bought a landed property in this old estate and was building a 3 and a half storey towering house. Well the, new citizen, the owner of the house was also present and when, I spoke with him during the tea session I found out that he was a new citizen formerly from China, just gained his citizenship and bought not 1 but 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru alone. I was surprised and saddened because many Singaporeans cannot afford to do the same, and this new citizen, no matter how he may have made his wealth is able to do so.

Many young Singaporeans I talk to, especially those who have recently graduated and have just entered the workforce feel demoralized because many of the things that they grew up aspiring to have are now beyond their reach. Our aggressive growth strategies, which allowed cheaper foreign workers, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans. I remember when I started work in 1985, my salary was $1900 as an entry level engineer. After a few years I could afford a house and a car. Today, 28 years later, an entry level engineer in Singapore earns $2600, just $700 more than what I earned when I started. The mathematics is very simple, the cost of living did not just go up by 1.3% per annum the last 27 years and even more, the cost of owning a HDB flat is did not just go up by 37% since 1985.

Finally, I am perturbed by the banquet analogy used by Minister Khaw. We are talking about lives of Singaporeans. Our banquet guests come for one night and leave when the function is over. There is no turning back when we grant PR and citizenships. We must be more exact about the numbers we want to add to the Singapore population and not plan on a basis of 'hoping we hit some number"". Because if overdo things and end up with a population of more than 7m, it may be too late to stop the fast moving train of population growth when we fire up all the engines of growing the population. We missed the mark the last 10 years, and are already paying a high price for that mistake.

In my speech in this house in 2008 during the committee of supply debate on the population I urged the government to abandon the ""the instant tree mentality"" in trying to grow the population in response to the declining birth rates. At that time, I did not agree with the rate of growth pursued and we know the consequences and the hardship Singaporeans faced as a result of the rapid growth, Instant trees cannot grow strong roots and can be uprooted in difficult times. I once again urge the government to slow down and plan on reaching their population target over a longer time horizon. I don't think we can live with a 6.9m population in 2030. We may be able to handle it in 2050, no one really knows. Please abandon this 'instant tree"" mentality as we cannot afford to make Singaporeans lives more difficult as a result. I rather we err on the side of caution when it comes to growing our population. We cannot keep paying a high price for planning misjudgements.

In Conclusion, I would like to see us take a breather from re-growing our population again. We have too many problems as a result of the last breath taking population growth rate. As a government we need to rebuild the trust and confidence among Singaporeans that our citizens matter most to us and that we are willing take a break from our relentless drive for growth to solve their problems, make their lives more comfortable, give them a better quality of life and show them that any future growth of population will not create similar social and cost of living problems. At this stage many Singaporeans from all walks of life don't have the confidence that we can handle another steep growth of the population, so let's not push it. I would like all of us, including the government to spend the time creating and environment that gives us confidence in our future and one where our young can see a sense of hope of opportunity and if we fail to instil a sense of hope and opportunity for our future generations, we will not be able to root them here and build a strong national identity and a strong nation. This is what building a strong Singapore core should entail. So let's delay all plans for further population growth for n"

The gist of it is, my friend messaged me telling me he was going to commit suicide (not the first time) and so I did the only thing I could think of - I called 999. 

I honestly think at first he was trying to get me on his side cause our friends and he had had a falling out, and idk if he was trying to guilt trip me or what, but when I didn't respond the way he probably wanted me to, he went offline and didn't pick up my calls. 

Vaguely pissed, I gave the police his info, and he was arrested, and is currently in IMH. 

I think he blames me...and truth be told, I feel a little guilty for subjecting him to that, but I'm not even out of my teens myself, and it was the only thing I could think of to save him. I didn't want that guilt on me, should he die, that I didn't do what I should have to keep him alive. 

He's still under the impression that nothing is his fault, and that he's being mistreated etc etc, so idek. I guess I just wanted to get it out. 

UPDATE:
Since people have been asking, and probably wanna know what went on with IMH staff - my friend told me that he was screaming about how he didnt wanna be there, and got tranquilized immediately. Before that, he was held by the cops in a cell, handcuffed. This is what I meant by saying he was utterly mistreat"
9i530c,buttoxide,"Why 377A matters to me. I posted this on Facebook and my friend prompted me to share it here. ""Homosexuals are doomed to spend eternity in hell. If they wanted to change, they could be healed of their evil ways. If they would turn away from temptation, they could be normal again. If only they would try, and try harder, if it doesn't work.""

These were the words said by Mary Griffith to her son, Bobby Griffith, in the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" - a story of a how Mary Griffith, staunch Christian Mom of Bobby Griffith, fights to cure her gay son of his homosexuality. Bobby eventually spirals into depression and self-loathing. One night, he falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming truck, which kills him instantly.

I still remember that afternoon, almost ten years ago by now. My mom and I were in the car on Grange Road, just about to turn left into Ngee Ann City. This was during the aftermath of the AWARE saga in Singapore (AWARE is a women's organization in Singapore. in 2009, a group of right-wing Christians orchestrated a takeover protest of their sexual education material in which same-sex attraction was deemed OK). The radio was covering the story and asked for listeners to call in with their views on the matter. After listening to the cover, my mom at the steering wheel turned to me and said a sentence I will never forget.

""These homosexuals are evil, and they should burn in hell.""

I understand that in staunchly religious households, such words would not have been uncommon. However, what affected me was the speed, the surprise, and the suddenness of it all. I was minding my own business in the car, and in that single sentence, the mom that I knew for twenty years was gone. In her stead I could only see someone else - caring in same way, but it never felt like the same person that I could trust. If this person found out about my secret, what would happen to me? I dared not find out.

To my mom, it was an off-handed comment that she probably won't remember. But to me, it felt like my entire world was upended.

Have you watched the Pixar movie, Inside Out? Central to the movie was the idea of core memories, which were key moments in one's life that shape one's personality. This very moment, to me, became one of them. The suddenness of the topic and the vitriol in her voice was unforgettable. This memory has stuck to me till this very day, almost ten years down the road.

If you're gay, no one is safe, not even from their families. The world felt a lot darker, and a lot more dangerous.

I stayed silent for the rest of the journey. At the time, it was only a few more months until it was time for me to go to America to pursue my undergraduate studies. It was in that very moment, I vowed to myself that I *must* keep my secret away from family. I knew that had my parents found out, there was a real danger that they would cut off funding to me and call me back because they would assume I was 'influenced by the western agenda' - even though I already knew starting in secondary school!

For the next four years, I bided my time in college. I did call back to my parents, but I hated the idea of doing so. I figured that the less I share about my life, the less likely my parents would find out, and I could graduate in peace. The goal was to remain closeted until I was financially independent, and I succeeded. I am fortunate to come from a financially stable family. My parents have absolutely no need for me to support them for retirement. Hence, my primary concern was to establish a stable income for myself. It was only through freedom of a stable income could I not rely on the parents that could possibly kick me out for being gay. Was that paranoia? True, it was highly unlikely for my family. But it was a chance I could not afford to take.

Overall, I had a good college experience. Back in Singapore, my church, while not outwardly hateful, did weigh in on the topic of homosexuality with the usual quotes from Leviticus, along with a sprinkle of ""lifestyle"", ""choice"", and (my personal favorite) ""hate the sin, not the sinner."" At least I could now enjoy my Sundays, without the occasional self-denigration from the pulpit.

But the past sermons and that memory continued to affect me. Night after night, I called out to God and asked him why? Why couldn't I, like the Book of Mormon musical, ""turn it off""? It certainly didn't feel like a choice. If it was, why burden me with such a choice when everyone else seems to have it easy? Is this God’s cruel punishment on me for something else? I always wondered what would have happened if I was born gay in a different environment. I read of Matthew Shepherd, the American student who was beaten, tortured, and left to die. I read of news about ISIS, where brothers and parents threw their gay families off buildings. Some friends dismissed it as the work of crazy people. All I could think of was that car drive on Grange Road. I could not shake off the look in her eyes. Perhaps society is just a few laws away from craziness, after all.

Four years passed and I got my degree with distinction. I returned back to Singapore, with a stable job waiting for me - mission accomplished! But shortly after, my dad decided to have a private talk with me - one of the few he's ever had with me his entire life. He inquired why I felt so distant, so different from the boy he once knew. My mom, who was always a worrywart, has visibly aged since four years ago. Because I have become so distant and resistant to communication, she worried even more in my absence.

I was not ready to share the real reason why I was so silent. I clammed up again. I felt no motivation to share my reason anymore. I have survived four years without sharing my life. Why start now? I have learned to stop caring about sharing my life with my parents.

Shortly, my mom found out about my sexuality. I gathered it was probably due to my over-zealous sharing of Pink Dot posts on Facebook (I didn’t really care about them finding out at this point). One day, my Mom confronted me about it. When she took my silence to be a ‘yes’, while holding back tears, the first words out of her mouth were ""We shouldn't have sent you to the U.S."" In the end, my prior fears were not unfounded. In that moment, I felt validated - validated that my strategy for those four years was not unfounded and could have saved me from an early withdrawal from school.

Thankfully, for me, it was a (reasonably) happy end. After the tears, she said that while she can't approve of my 'lifestyle' due to the church, she did say that she still loves me.

Overall, I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Besides this incident, my parents have given me every material need, the necessary attention, and tools needed to succeed in life. I was never thrown out of the house, beaten as child, nor been assaulted on the street (yet). However, I cannot say the same for some of my friends and the greater gay community as a whole. I have no illusions; I've had a great life so far. But if that single moment on Grange Road still affects me ten years after, I am sure that some other son, in some other less privileged family, with less money, less love, and denied opportunities to stay hidden, would have it much worse. ""Prayers for Bobby"" was based off a true story, after all.

Hence, for those who believe that 377A is 'just a symbol', then consider yourself even more fortunate than I am. To many, 377A is not 'just a symbol'. For some, 377A has become the flag in which the religious right is using to rally its supporters. For some, 377A is a constant reminder that we feel less like citizens but more like a bargaining chip to the government. For some, 377A has become the perfect veil for others say hurtful, ignorant comments with little repercussions on sunny little Singapore.

To me, it is clear: day after day, 377A is a sum of all of the above. It is a constant reminder that we are alone against our bullies.

To the religious who believe that repealing 377A will lead to the moral decay of Singapore, the story of ""Prayers for Bobby"" does not end at Bobby's death. Marry Griffith desperately searches for answers to her son's death and eventually realizes that it was her hurtful words that drove her own son to suicide. She shares in her closing speech:

""Unknown to you, they will be listening, as you echo 'amen'. And that will soon silence their prayers. Their prayers to God for understanding, and acceptance, and for your love. But your hatred, and fear, and ignorance of the word 'gay' will silence their prayers. So, before you echo 'amen' in your home, and place of worship, think. Think, and remember. A child is listening.""

So if you've read all the way to this point, please remember that even if you are a regular churchgoer with no contact with the gay community, I am sure that someone you know and love is being hurt by your very actions. It could be one of the quiet kids sitting in the corner every Sunday School. It could be your best friend, your cousin who's never seemed to have a girlfriend. Above all, it could be your son who you never suspected a bit. And just like every mention of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 from the pulpit, I can tell you from personal experience that each mention of 377A along with the ""hate the sin, not the sinner"" rhetoric will chip away at that kids self-esteem and self-worth.

So let the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" be a cautionary tale. The real damage to society will not come from the moral decay that you speak of. It will come from the erosion of trust between you and the children that you never knew were listening to your words all along. As Mary Griffith realized too late, you can't turn back the clock once the deed has been done.

But unlike Mary Griffith's situation, the Singapore story does not end... yet. The absence of 377A itself will also be a new symbol. A symbol that a secular Singapore with religions preaching harmony and not division as the way forward. A symbol that the government does not make short-term voter gains at the expense of minority citizens. A symbol that gay people are no longer defined by a law 'gross indecency' but are finally reduced to mere human beings, just like everyone else.

And for those who aren't LGBT and are quiet or ambivalent about showing your support, we do need your help to drown out the noise of bigotry. Just as how my experience was traumatic and drove me back to hiding, your outward show of support, whether you realize it or not, is a huge deal for those around you who are still closeted and in hiding. It will give them less and less reasons to hide. The single raindrop never feels responsible for the flood, but with your help, I pray that the tide will turn sooner.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold. I will be matching the golds I've gotten by donating $10 to Pink Dot for each one I've gotten. Please consider donating if you're local and believe in the cause. Man does not live by reddit gold alone after al"

I believe I suffer from anxiety of some sort. I've never been diagnosed because I'm too chicken shit to get my parents to bring me to a clinic but I do have my fair share of panic attacks at night (hyperventilating until I get breathless and have to use my inhaler because I'm asthmatic, overly sweaty, dizzy etc.)

Usually I get through it with the help of my friends. But during that period, we had just received our A level results. Being the only one with decent grades in my group of friends (my other friends scored less than 70) I felt it would be rude of me to call them up for help when they have so much more to deal with on their hands.

I was feeling pretty helpless at that point. Various things escalated and I got into a huge argument with my parents and siblings. I have never been close to any of my family members as I've always felt out of place with them. It's a long story but the environment I have at home isn't the best. 

A lot of things escalated and on that night, I truly felt like taking my own life. As a last resort,  I thought I'd call up the Samaritans of Singapore. That's when shit went downhill. 

The lady who answered my call was pretty sweet at first, told me to breathe and stuff. She asked me why I'm crying and I told her I didn't know. I told her that I'm having a panic attack and she asked if I had anything I could do to help myself. I told her I was never diagnosed with it medically before. 

She asked me if I was feeling suicidal and I said no. Note that it was kinda really hard to answer her questions considering how hard I was sobbing. I told her no, which was a lie. I mean I obviously didn't need her to call the police on me or some shit. So she asked me again why I was crying.  

I honestly couldn't answer her with how hard I was sobbing but I wanted someone to tell be that everything will be OK. I wanted someone to tell me that things will get better, and I just have to be stronger. 

She told me she couldn't understand me over my sobbing and to call back again 10 minutes later. At this, I was pretty damn shocked and I cried even more because I'm a big baby. 

I was desperate at that point pretty much. I just really needed a soothing voice to help me pick myself up. I knew I wanted to take my life but I knew that I wanted to give life a second try at the same time. So I tried,  and I really did try my best to open up to her regarding all of the problem I was facing, how it all escalated and led to one big mess and how I have no one to turn to. 

Anyway, part of the whole list of issues was about how I have privacy issues with my family. The operator defended my parents saying that they had the right to know everything about me. And OK, maybe I didn't elaborate my problems enough but it's kinda hard when you're constantly sobbing and you can't breathe very well. 

So I told the operator that I have major trust issues because of my anxiety and that I was was they didn't respect my privacy more even though I told them to. The operator then told me to just not tell them anything and that this shouldn't be an issue since I'm opening up to her when she's a stranger. At that point I started getting a little bit pissed which made me cry even more to the point that I couldn't even get a single word out of my mouth. 

The fact that she's a stranger is exactly the reason why I'm opening up to her. She can't see me and I can't see her. She can only know me. She doesn't know my name, doesn't know my background, doesn't know anything about me so there would be no prior judgement. Yes, she is a stranger but an anonymous stranger was exactly the person I thought I needed to talk to. Someone who could give me advice from an outsider's perspective and who doesn't and won't know anything about my identity. But maybe it's just wishful thinking. Judgement exists everywhere. 

She asked me how old I was and I told her that I'm 19. She told me that she didn't believe me (probably implying that I sounded immature). I was shocked nonetheless but I tried to explain myself. But really, why the heck would I ever have to prove my age to her in this situation? 

I told her I just finished my A levels. She then asked me if i meant o levels instead. Now I know I sound pretty incoherent from sobbing constantly but don't you think I still have enough brains not to confuse the two together?

As I sobbed even harder she started getting impatient and told me she couldn't understand me at all, and to call back later when I've calmed down. Now excuse me if I'm wrong but aren't you, as a hotline that it supposed to provide emotional support do the exact opposite of that? I'm calling you precisely because I am NOT calm. 

In the end, she told me to seek help from family services and gave me a list of places that I can seek counselling from. I told my friends about it the next day and they wrote an email to the Samaritans of Singapore on my behalf. They replied to them to apologise and said that they would let the supervisor know, and asked for a name if I happened to catch any. I wasn't sure if there was any other correspondence that happened after that as I was too chicken shit to pry further. 

There isn't much of a moral to this story. I just felt like I had to share my experience. I'm not sure if this is wanted and I don't think it will help anyone. Do take note that I'm not discouraging anyone to call SOS if they ever need help. Peoples experiences vary and mine just happened to be a particularly shitty one. I know that no good will come out of me sharing this as the issue is long past and I know I should muster the courage to seek professional help. I just felt that this would help me move one to a new chapter in life. 

Honestly, talking to my friends the next day helped me out much more than calling the hotline ever d"
9hygl3,badchab,"My (21/F) school counsellor (30s/F) molested me This happened when I was in my first year of secondary school so I was 12 turning 13. I was having having my first psychosis episode (wasn’t diagnosed yet but I have bipolar). I had insomnia and was hearing voices. I was doing very badly in school, I couldn’t focus in class and was punished by my Teachers for not completing homework, resting my head on the table in class and daydreaming. One day, my teacher came up to me and asked me if anything was wrong. I told her I couldn’t sleep and that I was hearing voices. She then referred me to the school counsellor. 

The counsellor was a female with short curly hair. She was very nice and well liked by the students. Me and my Friends would hang out at her office and just talk to her during recess. So I felt like I could trust her. 

The first few sessions were fine until one day, I entered her room and she locked the door. She closed the blinds and turned off the lights. I was sitting on the sofa and she sat on the table really close to me, our knees touching. She kept saying “it’s going to be okay” and proceeded to rub up and down my thighs and under my skirt. 

I couldn’t move. At that age, I didn’t know what was happening. I thought all counsellors did that. She eventually stopped, and told me to leave and she locked the door behind her. The next day, I told my teacher that I tried to commit suicide and she told my counsellor. The counsellor sent me away to the mental hospital. The next 4 years I spent in the school, she would try and avoid me unable to look me in the eyes. 

It really fucked me up because the person who was supposed to help me, hurt me. 

I am now 21 and studying to be a counsellor. I want to be the person I needed when i was younger and to prove that she was a poor excuse of a counsellor. 

Recently, I was asked by my social worker if I wanted to make a police report. I said no, because it has been such a long time ago but I worry that she has been doing that to other kids. What do you thin"

Felt compelled to share this after I learnt that a friend (not very close but was okay with him) recently committed suicide after an episode of depression. Thing is, he seemed okay. Even his Facebook was full of photos of him hanging out with his friends, his social club (he played soccer with some team for those Sunday leagues), etc. etc. I was really shocked to hear that he struggled with depression for a while. He didn't seem to show it.

There was a point in my life too where I had struggled with depression. After a particularly tough and gruelling semester at uni, I went through what was termed a brief psychotic episode where I was not myself, and I did some pretty weird things that confused my friends and family. Sad to say, I did contemplate ending my own life.

Fortunately I was able to receive the help and treatment that I needed to recover. Happy to say that I think I am pretty much okay now, but I do remember that when you're going through a toll on your mental health, sometimes it really does not show on the outside. In fact, it was only when one of my best friends asked me if I was okay, did I open up and share and he could help me get the treatment I needed.  I must thank all my friends and family for helping me through that period, and I truly am grateful that I have an overwhelmingly supportive family and friends base that believed in me even when I didn't.

Long story short, remember that sometimes depression doesn't always show up on the surface. All it takes is a 'are you okay', and you can very well be saving someone's li"
94oz3t,pekyj,"(Update) Help me, I have been sexually harassed by my neighbours for three years Hi r/singapore. No fancy writing today because I’m rather exhausted.

Updates:

* Mother of one of the teenage boys DMed me after seeing my post on Facebook. She confirmed that most of the boys sitting at the lift landings are friends of her son, clarified that she doesn’t stay in Singapore (like I mentioned, there’s an overcrowding issue in that flat so I guess her son is taken care by her siblings/mother/cousins) and sounded sincerely apologetic. She told me she‘ll speak to her son and asked if she could speak to my mom and I separately face-to-face when she visits Singapore.
* When my boyfriend sent me home last night, one of the teenage boys were standing at the lift landing. He looked about 18 and was accompanied by 2 kids significantly shorter than him. I believe the kids are aged 5-7. I listened to some of the suggestions given here, and glared back at him instead of looking down. After we walked into my unit, the boy shouted, “Cheebye!” We didn’t respond. After a while, he shouted again, “This mother fucker posted videos of us!” My boyfriend was obviously, and rightfully, agitated but I told him to not respond. Hope I did the right thing.
* Spoke to Shin Min, Zaobao and Wanbao. News is expected to be out today. Sadly, when they came, the boy’s mother probably already warned them to be quiet so no one was hanging around. We still got some photos, and I also sent them previous photos/videos I took. I think I did okay during the interview, considering how nervous I used to be when talking to strangers when I was younger.
* I know I told some redditors via PM that I’ll give an update after the news is out. I’m so sorry but I changed my mind. I don’t want to read the article. I don’t know what’s gonna be reported and I think I need to take a break from this for mental health reasons. I experienced panic attacks and I’m super worn out from having to defend, explain and justify myself. Not asking for pity here, just to clarify. I’m just tired and rather defeated. It breaks my heart reading the many private messages I’ve been receiving on Facebook regarding other stories of harassment too. It’s true that negativity sucks up your energy.
* People casted doubt over my statements so much that I started questioning myself too. Did I blow things out of proportion? Did I ruin their lives? I can’t live with that. At some point, I asked my boyfriend if I did wrong. He assured me that I did what I have to do because I deserved to feel safe. I guess. I just keep telling myself that if I did not lie about anything, then there’s no need to be afraid of what people say about me.
* A lot of people asked if I went to so-and-so organisations. I’m going through the list and there are a few options I haven’t thought of, like AWARE. Some asked about my plan. I honestly didn’t expect the post to go viral. I thought it’ll garner about 100 shares on Facebook, and 10-20 replies on Reddit like most of my previous posts. The plan was to then take the posts to my MP during meet-the-people session after I end my school semester next week and see how it turns out. Now I’m gonna keep watch of the situation outside my house and approach them when/if needed.
* My words has been, inevitably, twisted by some people. When I wrote, “My mom is a hawker,” some people took it as my mom owns a hawker centre, or a stall. I have since clarified that with the reporters who asked.
* People on FB asked what I wore/wear. I chose to ignore those questions because it’s irrelevant. That’s like saying someone deserves to be robbed because they return home late.
* Someone asked about me travelling. I‘m clarifying here so I don’t have to repeat myself. Some of the trips were work trips, and those that aren’t, are very tightly budgeted. E.g. Bringing snacks from home to save on a meal, eating only one meal overseas, walking up to 50 minutes everywhere. I also explained on my blog how I managed my finances. Basically, I live frugally, I save and work a lot. Freelance designing, part time jobs, event jobs — everything that comes my way. Please look at my blog if you still have any questions: [https://pekyj.blogspot.com/2018/08/ayeee-its-me.html](https://pekyj.blogspot.com/2018/08/ayeee-its-me.html)
* Lastly, I privatised my Instagram. Not because I’m guilty but because I know people are going to keep searching, and my mom and boyfriend are really private people. I don’t think it’s fair for people to discuss about them when I am the one involved. I don’t know why people (on FB, not here) keep bringing up boyfriend. As if my boyfriend doesn’t have a life outside of me. He can’t be here 24/7, he has his own family and he has to work too.

I read almost every comment in my last thread but I’m really drained of energy right now. Thank you for all the support and for believing my words, even when I couldn’t provide evidence of the harassment. It’s a he-said-she-said situation and I would have understood if you think I’m lying so I’m really, really grateful that you chose to believe me. I also if I made some of you doubt my statements or that everything seems fake and orchestrated.

I hope you know that I am immensely thankful for every comment. I hope it’s okay that I take a few days off to focus on my final assignments and test before coming back to reply.

Thank you once again.

Edit:

Update 2:

* As [u/suicide\_aunties](https://www.reddit.com/u/suicide_aunties) suggested, I manned up and read the news report to make sure everything was accurate. It's on zaobao online, shin min and wanbao. All's good. Wanbao included an interview with the family who, predictably, denied they ever harassed me. They also claimed their gatherings stopped after 10pm. Doesn't matter though, because I think with media attention, hopefully (but I've been wrong before), the MPs will take us seriously.
* I spent some time with my mom and brother, who made my day so much better.
* I bumped into them downstairs and they started hurling vulgarities at me. Their grandma was also present.
* But we also bumped into a couple of neighbours who told me to find them if more problem arises :')
* When we returned home, one of the kids were sleeping outside. He woke up to glare at us. As we were walked by, he kicked a chair after us. Thankfully, I turned on my audio recording in the lift so I now have audio, pictorial and video evidence of him throwing the chair. My mom and him had some confrontation in Malay (she asked whether he's indignant and he said he was yadda yadda). Then he called his mom, who was the lady who messaged me.
* I messaged his mom when I got home, told her what happened, including her mom letting her kids hurl vulgarities at me. She wanted the video, which I promptly sent. She seems really apologetic after that. Some other family members are still defending his behaviour on Facebook, even after watching the video.

That's all for now. I'll see how it goes in the next few da"

868w56,GramTooNoob,"Depressed about future prospects Long story short, my dad suffered a major stroke 2 years ago which left him bedridden in a nursing home and I rage quit my job 1 year ago. My father lost all his asset gambling in his younger days so he had no asset to his name and I have been living with his two sisters (unmarried, my aunts). Normally I should not have to worried about this, but it turns out my Dad only had $2 in his bank account after gambling the CPF he withdrew at our world class casino. He didn't have much insurance because he cancelled them to save on premiums. For what he had, Aviva denied his claim because they claim he false declared his health status on application (many years ago) and will thus ""eat"" his premium and terminate the policy. The only thing I managed to claim successfully was the DPS and Eldershield thanks to NTUC, but it was after a lengthy one year process to obtain all the ""funny"" documents they needed. Apparently taking care of a mentally incapacitated person is harder than taking care of a dead person, thanks to red tapes everywhere. You don't just walk and say, I am the son and expect everything to fall into place. There is no one unified system at all.

Nonetheless, there was a whole lot of drama in the first year of his stroke due to the hospital, social workers and incapable relatives that requires me to attend to every single thing like I own the company, and I can take time off anytime I want to be a good son like on television. Eventually I was so burn out that everything finally forced me to rage quit my job after a falling out with management. Stuck in a contract was horrible enough but they were so eager to take advantage of the fact that I needed the job and money, instead of negotiating properly. I also dropped out of private uni because I needed cash flow to pay for all of my father's bills and that Kaplan was insensitive to my predicament by not allowing partial refund of my paid fees. Instead asking me to pay the full amount again when I am ready to re-module. I didn't take that well, so I did not extend the deferment. *Let's not say I did not try to get my degree, ok?* My dad rather gamble than fund my studies and when I finally saved enough for further studies, I need to pay for his medical needs. I was screwed over hard, and ultimately no money means no paper degree no matter how talented I may be. I even tried to negotiate with the company to send me for training on company time, but its always no training budget for contract staffs. And then the usual, if you go training on company time, then what we hire you for? During my years in the company, never once was I send for training. When there is a new project, they just hire someone to implement it instead of giving me the opportunity. And when its implemented, I get a few power point slides and magically I'm qualified to support the new system. It really is vomit blood.

Although I was jobless for a year, the nice thing was that I was able to get everything settled personally like the good son I should be. Or at least, I thought it should be. But it turns out that putting him in a nursing home does not entirely resolve me of my problem. He has so many medical appointments that requires me to follow up, and if I don't attend, there are funny cases where medication is missing or not collected from the hospital. Or the appointment rescheduled to another time so I can attend. I don't really know whose fault this is since the excuse I keep hearing is that **""Sorry, I don't speak English so I cannot understand""**, so I need to be the one to take care of everything, because once again... I am the son. This keeps taking up my time and I cannot rid myself of them, so this becomes a problem when I want to find a new job. My education level is only up to Diploma and that limits my options. The roles I quality for are pretty much IT Helpdesk / Technicians which don't really have a work life balance option due to over-outsourcing. Pay wise, they are only around $2.6k and it is pretty much a dead end career, so there is no progression path. Having to pay for my father's needs and eventually his 2 sisters as they get older, with this salary really puts me at a lost. 

I have a D7 in O'lv math and that is what really screw me over big time but unless I am really that bad at math, I absolutely do not see how I can start a family (If I even have that option) and take care of everyone with a low salary. The reason I need to take care of his 2 sisters is that they took care of me when my father didn't and they took out their savings to pay off my father's gambling debts, which he didn't even brother returning to them when he withdrew his CPF. Even now, when I am not working, for some strange reasons the government's means testing suggest that I can afford to pay $1200++ a month for my father's nursing home and this is excluding all his other medicines and specialist appointments. He has over 20+ medications and among them are anti depressive pills which I don't even have the luxury of taking. As much as I can, I have tried to make ends mean but at some point in time... there is only so much one can do. Social workers I spoke to are like, well live for yourself, not for others. Find a girlfriend! But i look at my situation and I don't exactly see how I even have the luxury to live for myself. If anything, I don't know of any girl in Singapore that would even consider my position as potential boyfriend material. The truth is, I have been fighting by myself for the last 30 years without anyone to seek advise from. Friends? Let's just say, its different from television. Everyone has their own problem and their broken fingernail is more important. The best you can get out of anyone is pretty much, a listening ear on whatsapp and some **""You can do it! You should come to church and donate for Jesus's blessing.""** 

I don't blame anyone though and this really issn't a rant post. I appreciate everyone that has been in my life, whether good or bad *(everything is a learning experience)* but ultimately, there is only so much you can beat out of a dead horse. After considering all possible options, I truly believe that ending my life and letting the government take care of my family's needs might be the best logical choice. Alternatively, I can rob the bank and get myself caught intentionally so I can get some free re-skilling opportunities in jail. Maybe when I come out, I can become some story teller with a very dramatic bestseller book to fund my retirement. To be honest, I don't know what I am expecting from this post, but this is in a way my attempt at screaming for help. Whether I deserve help or how much help I truly deserve, I don't know. Counselors always tell stories where family of 4 struggle with a household income of $2k, and they live a very happy, satisfied life so I will be just fine if I try. But how true is this story really? The bright side is that maybe the hubby can have sex with his wife to destress, but I can't fuck anyone in my family to destress. Maybe the 2 kids will grow up and help to support the family, but my situation aren't even that. I honestly feel that, I have reached the end of the crossroad and this is the end of my bloodline. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't go pub/club, I haven never even gone on overseas vacation, never took a plane before, I save whatever I can. I don't even go to cinemas. I'm not even fat, I eat a very cheap diet that puts me a little underweight but where did this effort ultimately took me? A boring person with an unattractive lifestyle that no Singaporean girls will want to date, and a aging family to take care of. Honestly, where is my future? I don't see any. To be honest, I may not have the budget to spurge on dates even if a girl want me. Singapore is just very plain straight forward. **""Bo money ah? Die lor. I only got one life, you want? Come take it la.""**

Its a pretty long post, much longer than I expected and I thank you if you have read everything. In a way, I felt better after getting this out. If you are responding though, I have a question. If you were in my position, what would you have done? Would suicide really not be the most educated option?

**PS: Pls don't suggest investing in cryptocurrencies. I deleted my bitcoin and doge wallet in 2010.**

**Big Edit:** So there are alot of comments way more than I expected and I appreciate all support. I'm not really that responsible a person like some of you think. It is just that, I try to be a good samaritan and so I pick up the slack here and there, and somehow eventually things became so dependent on me that whose else is going to do it, if not me? I'm forced into where I am today not because I want to. I have actually very much considered disavowing my father and then migrating and abandoning everyone for the greater good. If Singapore was bigger, I would most certainly not hesitate to move to another city. Its just that my whole plan was pretty much, once I settled everything. I would kill myself so in a way that was the master plan. I rage quit my job because I knew I didn't need to put up with shit anymore if I am going to die soon. But things wouldn't settle, and it dragged so long to the point where one day I suddenly feel so lonely that I say, maybe I need to do something, walk out of this darkness and attempt to go back to society. But then I have no real plan for it, or maybe I have but I dunno if its a good plan, a bad plan or another disastrous mistake just waiting to happen.

There's alot of suggestions in here and I thank you very much. Its true that if I don't suicide, there can be many options out and some of these options involves ignoring the future ahead and then praying that things will work out eventually. That once I get a job, everything will be better. But the real problem here is, and what I can't solve in my head is which I will elaborate further is that instead of saving money every month, all the money goes into my Dad's nursing home and medical bills. Now my aunts don't make much, so its hard for them to chip in much when they also have their own medical issues. So the bulk falls on me but still we get by. Just that nobody saves any money at the end of each month, and pray that the existing savings don't get touched. Why? Because my aunt will need those money themselves when they grow older and retire. So this puts things in a very weird cycle, especially given how I have achieved nothing in life thus far. So I pay, we pay until my Dad dies and he dies a happy man, well cared for and everyone think I am such a good son. Then my aunts turn come and oh because I was so capable of handling things before, people's expectation would be that ""oh, i'm sure he can do it again"". So yup, let's do it again. Then eventually everyone dies, leaving me alone without any savings, career or well... let's not say family. I don't want to make this into a sobbing story of ""I cannot find a girlfriend because I have no money!!"". So well, what do I do? I assume I would be in my late 60s or early 70s by then and I don't expect my health to be 100% perfect so... I die to join everyone in the afterlife.

I feel very sad when I think it that way, but I need not be that sad because things haven't played out yet. That's what many are telling me. But I dunno how to ignore something that will eventually happen anyway. Thus, it is just a simple matter of whether I die now in my 30s or i die later in my 70s. Either way, I die as a failure. But its not ""right"" to tell say **""Yes Gram, pls go and kill yourself. I fully support your decision.""** so they say, don't worry. Things will work out. But how will things work out? I ask them, they dunno. I ask myself, I dunno. So... what then? It seems like just delaying the inevitable to me.

If I disavow everyone, np. I just restart my life plain and simple, reach 35 buy my own house and throw a house warming party, impregnate my neighbour's daughter by mistake and I start my own family chapter. And I die in my 70s as a successful husband, good father and someone to be ""proud"" of. But do I need to start my own family? Not really. Do I need a girlfriend? Not really. Do I need sex? Not really. They are all luxury, not a necessity. So I choose to sacrifice myself, but then I feel suicidal and ya the cycle begins again. I'm not a dumb person and by no means have I not considered the possibilities. But what I have considered may not be big enough, since there are options that I am unaware of or misunderstood and that it aren't as bad as I painted it. Ok, I am open to explore it but if the advise is just ""Get a job Gram, that's your first step and then start saving!"". That is a pointless advice imo, no matter how reasonable it is because it just puts me back to square one. I am not trying to sound unappreciative btw, I am just frustrated at being looked upon like an idiot.

**Edit 2:** Based on the comments, I realized that from my friends' perspective, I am the dead weight so that might be why they aren't ""helping"", just act like things will resolve by itself. Well, I can afford to disavow these friends. Thanks for helping me to realize this!

**Edit 3:** Going through all the suggestions and private messages, I am suddenly feeling very overwhelmed by what needs to be done and what I should be doing. My head hurts really bad and I am starting to regret asking for help when I am not ready to be helped. It is all reminding me what I should have or should not done for a better life, and why I wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Now I remember why I concluded it was easier to simply restart a new life and make sure I do it correctly the next time. Sorry guys, I don't think I can do it anymore. I think things just got worse after asking for he"
7us3c4,yoosungtome,"SCAPE Mental Health services ""emergency contact""? Hey, this is my first time posting on this subreddit so I'm sorry if I missed any of the sidebar rules. (I'm posting this on a friend's behalf.)

My friend has been going through some serious mental health issues and has sought therapy at IMH, which she says doesn't work for her. Now, she has decided to go to SCAPE's Mental Health services for counselling as a last-ditch attempt.

The thing is, when you register at SCAPE, they ask you to put someone as an emergency contact, and she put my number as the contact because her family is against her seeking help and will react with physical abuse if they find out she went to SCAPE. (I've already told her to report her family to the police but she refuses.) But I'm still legally a minor (I turn 18 only later this year).

My question is: under what circumstances will SCAPE contact me? I'm under the impression that they'll only call me if my friend attempts suicide or something equally drastic. I was honestly reluctant to be put as an emergency contact because I know what I can do for her is very limited as I'm a minor without any resources of my own, and I'm very worried I might be called down to the police station or something to sign legal things that I don't understand. (I know that sounds very far-fetched but that just illustrates how little I know about how the SCAPE Mental Health Services function.)

TL;DR: Under what circumstances will SCAPE mental health services contact the emergency contact? Do they have the power to tell the police what the patient has told th"

The burden would also be too heavy for me. I do hope that /r/Singapore will be able to identify a trustable charity where all these good intentions can go to. 

This morning, I was remembering a friend I lost to suicide, and decided to make this post. I miss her every fucking day, and hope no one will have to lose and miss somebody the way I am now. I am merely seeking redemption and don't deserve the compliments at all. Thank you anyway.

3e398z,thrwaysgacc,"[Serious] I need help with my GF. Ok so throwaway account, but I really appreciate the advise.

Background story, my GF is in her 20s. She just graduated with a degree, she's looking for a full-time job while currently doing freelance jobs to save up money. We have been together for more than 6 years. She's the youngest in the family.


So what I need help with? I suspect that my GF is slowly becoming depressed. Her family is a train-wreck, with her parents the main cause of it. Both her parents are in the retail business. They rent shops and sell clothes that cater to aunties, and (try) young adults too. They are **very** money-minded. Her mother has a very harsh mouth. E.g. When my GF spends money, her mother will say ""Wah someone a lot of money huh, can buy new things."" in a *very* sarcastic tone. Note: My GF buys those things 80% of the time using her **own** money she saved up from her freelance jobs. She seldom takes money from her parents because she does not want to give her mother an opportunity to berate her. Meanwhile her eldest brother who is in his 30s and **jobless* asks for money to buy the latest MacBook and iPad, she would give without saying a single word. You may deem this as being bias, I would say.

Ok so you may kinda get the picture (and sorry for the digress) but the main thing here is, my GF tried to commit suicide. What forced her to do so was her mother told my GF that (I kissed my GF's best friend during my GF's birthday party). Now this accusation was 100% false. My GF knows it and she believes me too. However she has a very bad temper and anger management so naturally she gets into a shouting match with her mother. One thing leads to another and due to her anger she decided to grab her penknife and 'wanted to kill her mother before ending her life'. Fortunately she did not but she locked herself in the room instead and threaten to commit suicide. Police was called, she was taken away but luckily we managed to convince the police it wasn't a suicide case hence she wasn't put in jail so no records. 

She feels that she isn't part of the family. I try to say things that doesn't make her feel that way but I'm not strong in this area. I do need help in this area too, like how to comfort her, etc. 

Currently I don't know what other information to include so if I didn't specify anything do ask. And thanks in advance.


TLDR: GF is becoming depressed. 1 suicidal attempt. Cause: Her fam"
4g1b5o,invalidentity,"More help to battle depression I originally posted an AMA, but it was removed by the moderators. Hopefully my new approach will be better suited for this subreddit.

Even with the various avenues of help and awareness available here in Singapore, we still hear of suicides and hardships faced by people with depression. Every life is precious. We need to do everything we can to save lives, and more people to voice their success stories which can help others and motivate them to not give up. Because of the personal and complex nature of depression, conventional treatment is not effective for everyone. Use my advice below as a last resort; PROFESSIONAL HELP SHOULD ALWAYS BE SOUGHT FIRST.

I started getting depressed on my first day of Secondary One, because my PSLE score was not good enough for me to go to the school I wanted. I was younger at that time, so I could not foresee how severe my condition would become. Come Secondary 4, I just could not cope with the stress from O Levels. I went to see my GP who referred me to the CGC. There, I was prescribed medication and skipped classes to attend therapy sessions but neither were effective. I became so lethargic that I could hardly get up from bed and couldn't study at all. I had no choice but to stop treatment and focus on my improving my poor grades (my L1R5 was 32 for prelims). Things were not looking up for me.

Nevertheless, I did my best for my Os and managed to enter a polytechnic course. I saw this as a new beginning, and an opportunity to start afresh. I was determined to not let depression take control of my life and screw up my studies this time. So I worked hard; I practised, made notes and clarified doubts. This drive to learn, improve and do well was more effective than any treatment I was given. It gave me a sense of purpose and I felt much better than I was last time. 

My efforts paid off; I attained a Diploma with Merit, as well as acceptance into one of the top ranked local universities. Just 3 years ago, I could not have imagined even making it out of secondary school; I actually have a brighter future now. 

**tl;dr:** Find a fresh start and turn your life around.

######Helping those with depression
It is EXTREMELY important to identify signs of depression early to prevent them from worsening. If your friend's posts on social media reflect self-esteem issues or suicidal thoughts, make sure they receive help ASAP. If treatment isn't doing well for them, let them know that there is always a plan B. It is important to build this mind-set in them: do your best and don't give up. Contact them once in a while to check on their progress; this will mean a lot to th"
32k1e0,anonguy123456,"Any opinions/discourse on suicide in Singapore? So I did some reading yesterday on the BBC and the 
TL;DR is that suicide is the no.1 killer of men in the UK.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32231774 - BBC article

Among other things, men are 4x as likely to kill themselves compared to women and the article/documentary suggest that it may have something to do with gender (i.e. men are given the role of breadwinners and changing times means they are left unable to fulfil this role).

They also attribute the rate of suicide and the reluctance to seek help to stereotypes of men; supposedly to be 'strong, silent' etc.

Now, I looked at Singapore and it has a few similar conditions as well. 

 - NS can be viewed as gender stratification (for men) and there is a certain degree of masculinity and bravado that comes with it. 

- Criminalization of suicide (S.309 Singapore Penal Code as per wikipedia), I don't know if it's still carried out or dormant. Additionally, there appears to be an urban myth that corpses are 'handcuffed' although I cannot confirm or deny the veracity of such claims (told to me by my uncle long ago and also from Google recently)

-Competitive, meritocratic environment; this is not an attack on meritocracy but my opinion is that it may contribute to suicidal tendencies through the pressure of failure among other things.

Demographically speaking however, more men than women kill themselves in Singapore as well (however it is not 4x as adverse) and the vulnerable group seems to be 20-29 age males (as opposed to UK 40-49).

My questions are as per usual, poorly formatted so pardon me but I would like to know your experience with the subject of suicide in Singapore. What are your theories or personal experience or friends experiences? Additionally what do you think are the reasons that more men kill themselves in Singapore than women? Same as the UK? Or, if you're of the opinion that there is nothing to worry about, why?

Thank you very much for your ti"

I am currently one year in army and have cases in the past contemplating suicide during secondary school. Of course I found something in life and things became better.

Fast forward. I have been in the army for a year and never once did I enjoy my time here other than enjoy doing everything with your friends. I'm combat fit and there's been ups and down in army, I have a hell time of a unit induction program and that being what I consider the worse experience in my life but that did not trigger my depression and anxiety nor anything. It was fun.

The only thing keeping me sane is being able complain to my friends but the same response suck thumb would come in. Recently I have been getting mood swings but not because of pressure in army, training has been considered very lax for me. 

I feel like a caged bird and honestly ,I'm sure everyone felt the same but they have been taking it with a suck thumb mentality. It is depressing seeing how easily people give up to power because they don't have a choice. It depresses me that I am unable to grasp the point of sucking thumb and finish this two years. 11 more months to go, wow! And they say time passes fast. Its depressing for someone to have power over you, you do not have a choice. Pity the north koreans under oppression

I'm getting anxiety feeling trapped and I hide it from people. They say I looked depressed but what can I tell them? I feel muscles tensing every moment knowing I'm trapped. I hate that knowing I have another 11 months of being in a bunk, being trapped in the same camp. The same old view. The same damn cook house. Marching pass same tree you see every damn day. 

My friends, my girlfriend tells me, it will pass. NO it doesn't work this way. Don't tell me it will pass, it is still going on. Don't tell me things will be over, its still not. Not yet. 

I understand the importance of deterrence. But this place isn't for me.... Please tell me what to do, its eating me everyday. Getting a pes F and hearing stories of people unable to lead a proper life has stopped me from checking up for depression but I'm tired... Please advice...

I am currently 15, 16 this year. A bit of backstory of myself, I have anxiety and depression ever since I was 12. At 12 years old, I've contemplated suicide and even attempted it but was stopped by a passer-by calling the ambulance. Ever since then, suicidal thoughts haven't really came into my mind since I've found a passion for online games and made lots of friends with it, until now. When I was 14 i stopped going to school because of bad experiences, and my anxiety got even worse. My parents also divorced during that time making it hell for me. Right now i've been posted to another secondary school and thankfully they are giving me another chance to start over, however, I just can't bring myself to go. Just the thought of going to school makes it hard to breathe. I can't sleep through the night, waking up 2 hours after I sleep. Thinking about school makes me want to go crazy, I sweat, and just go into a panic attack. I've went to NUH for counselling the past 2 years but it isn't really helping much as well. I'm really thankful for my parents at helping me to start anew but I just can't do it. I feel ashamed and disappointed at myself, but I don't want to let them down..

377kvg,syamilnaufal,"22 y/o looking for advise Hi everyone, 

I'm currently doing my last year in poly. I'm a year 4, but gonna graduate soon by August. I'm in Diploma in IT, which I regret taking up.(edit)

I have been doing my research on signing on to the SPF, but I have plenty of questions to ask. I feel that the info that I got is not convincing enough for me to sign on.

Plus, the enlistment letter I got this year is for CD. Most of my close friends who are in CD say it's best for a person like me not to go in CD. They have many reasons for that, but most of them says there are things happening inside there like, drug abuse and stuff like that? I don't really believe them, but maybe they could be right.(Edited)

I also went for the SPF Insight on 25th April. Most officers I spoke to, I feel they were telling half-truths. The SPF Insight also didn't reveal much on vocations, leaving me with many questions.

Some thread that I have been reading on HWZ: http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/national-service-knowledge-base-162/signing-spf-so-po-scheme-5037646.html

Reasons I want to sign on: 

1. I don't see myself taking up IT as a career at any point in my life(edited). I should've taken up Diploma in Events Management instead, should've continued what I studied in ITE. Thus the Diploma in IT is like redundant, just using as a paper to get a better pay.

2.I wanna sign on is because of the 30K lump sum and(hopefully) also the sponsorship for degree after 2-5 years in service as PO. Sponsorship is not easy to get as confirmed in the thread above and also at SPF Insight.

3. I feel that I would suit better as a PO. Have been combing through CD and SPF website, and I'm leaning more towards a career as a PO. 

My questions would be: 

1. Preferably which vocation should I sign on to?  I don't want to spend 100% of my time once I've signed on(Edited) . I'm thinking of going SOC but after seeing how skinny SOC officers/sergeants are at the insight, I'm like 50/50. Seems to be like they are overtrained. 

2. SPF and CD, what are the major differences between these 2 if you sign on?

3. I welcome any life advise. I really feel like shit, as if I hit rock-bottom. 

I'm really hoping for good replies, as this concerns my future.

9hwsh9,damstereiw1,"School kills me. Sorry for this shitpost. I just need to vent for a bit. So here's my story.

&#x200B;

School has only made my life worse. I was bullied from P5 to P6 by my classmates. I was ostracised and discriminated for my views opinions. I has a crush back then and she meant everything to me - cute laugh, alluring voice and a smile that would brighten my days. The day I confessed to her (through a letter) was the day of my downfall. She never talked to me since and that letter got passed around to everyone and all my classmates had their own little joke about how ""creepy"" I was. The only time I was honest and expressed my true feelings for someone, I became a laughing stock. I was shattered inside as people teased and made fun of me over and over and over again, every single day.

&#x200B;

I became a punching bag. People saw that I was weakened from the mental damage I sustained and proceeded to take advantage of me - both physically and verbally abusing me.

&#x200B;

""Yeah I know you're desperate for her.""

&#x200B;

""Come come guys lets move out of the way for Damster to stare at her again.""

&#x200B;

""Your drawings are shit.""

&#x200B;

""Ya la ya la you're so smart right? Go away lah, smart kid!""

&#x200B;

I still remember that time when my classmates made fun of me in public. I still remember that time when my classmates shamed me for coming from a ""poor"" family. I still remember that time when one of my classmates purposefully held my crush's hand just to make me feel jealous. Life back then was like a movie without a climax - absolutely miserable. I felt oppressed and worthless.

&#x200B;

Barely anyone talked to me for the two whole years of hell and sometimes I felt like I was going insane when sitting in a corner doodling. Doodling as I watched all the cliques having so much fun. I was so lonely that I would cuddle with a stuffed toy, pretending that its a loved one, and crying myself to sleep day after day. I still do :')

&#x200B;

I lost my social skills and developed a speech impediment. I couldn't talk properly, I stuttered when asking questions. It got so bad to the point where I became terrifyed of ordering food and would go out of my way to avoid it. I grew thinner and thinner. I felt so tired that I didn't want to do anything at all.

&#x200B;

What were the teachers doing when all of this was happening?

&#x200B;

""Again and again I'm telling you, just ignore them!""

&#x200B;

Fuck you, piece of shit. What an interesting way of saying ""I'm too lazy and incompetent to help you."".

&#x200B;

I felt so hopeless as even the teachers aren't willing to help me. I felt like a prisoner in my own body and I was going mad.

&#x200B;

At least I had gotten a 251 for PSLE. ""Your exam results is all that matters!"" Eat my ass, dad. Have fun with your mentally handicaped child.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to secondary school. Got into one of the schools with a high cut-off point. IP programme. SAP school. Shouldn't be too bad, right?

&#x200B;

The classmates there are fine, but now its the teachers that are torturing me.

&#x200B;

They don't teach us, they threaten us.

&#x200B;

""Stop doodling or I'll give you a demerit point!"" What kind of fucking education is this? What am I supposed to learn from this? I get that it's wrong to doodle in class as it's a sign of disrespect for the speaker, but what if some students don't get the idea? They won't learn anything from it.

&#x200B;

""You did something wrong. Write me a reflection letter and if I don't like it, you will re-write it."" Okay... now what the fuck's the point of a reflection letter when its contents has to revolve around what you personally enjoy reading and not my actual thoughts about the given situation? You just want control over your students, don't you?

&#x200B;

There's no freedom of speech. Here's an experience I had:

&#x200B;

PREVIOUSLY

&#x200B;

Me: \*Route A to my math class was blocked. Have to use route B.\*

&#x200B;

Me: \*Arrives at class late.\*

&#x200B;

2 DAYS LATER

&#x200B;

Me: \*Route A AND B to my math class was blocked. Had to find and use route C.\*

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""Why were you late?""

&#x200B;

Me: ""Oh, the route was blocked so I had to find another.""

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""This isn't the first time the route was blocked off. That is not a valid excuse.""

&#x200B;

Me: ""However, this time both routes that I have been using for the past two terms have been blocked, not to mention that this is the first time that so many routes have been blocked before. Basically, I didn't know of route C and has to spend extra time finding it.""

&#x200B;

Teacher: ""Okay, go stand at the back of the class as punishment for being late.""

&#x200B;

????????????

&#x200B;

WHAT? This teacher punishes people for things that they are not in control of, and also punishes people for not knowing information that wasn't even disclosed in the first place. No empathy. Not a human.

&#x200B;

He also doesn't take his students' words into account, what's the point of even reasoning with him? He is the kind of teacher that makes students feel worthless because in his eyes, everything a student does is wrong and he gets to decide whether to accept certain things said by students based on his personal feelings and mood.

&#x200B;

It's like criticising a historian for not knowing how to do algebra. It's fucking irrelevant.

&#x200B;

More, more more bullshit in my school!

&#x200B;

(This one happened to one of my classmates.) ""You didn't complete the assignment I gave you? Then I shall give you even more homework as punishment!"" Fucking what??? The above student is already struggling with that given topic and is trying to catch up with the rest of the class, and yet he is weighed down even more academically because of this? It's not really a punishment anymore when the impact of it can be detrimental to the receiver - that student's academic progress may have actually been slowed down because of this extra homework (Homework on topics that he has already learnt.) which may, as a result, fuck up his final exam grade due to the fact that he may not have time to catch up with all the topics? What shallow thinking from the teachers...

&#x200B;

There was once I walked into an unauthorised examination area. Yes, it was wrong of me but the way I got treated afterwards is just.... ???????

&#x200B;

""Stupid! Look at these no-brainers! Do you even know who is allowed to enter those areas? \*Takes out phone\* Going to snap a photo of you two idiots and SHAME you!""

Although she did (Very very briefly.) explain to me why I shoudn't be there, she spent half the session verbally attacking me. How is this allowed? It suggests that my school supports the idea of using personal attacks, insults and manipulating students' emotions (Using fear.) as a form of education.

&#x200B;

This one happened just two days ago:

&#x200B;

The teacher told us to take out our study materials to revise for the upcoming tests. I naturally study better at the comfort of my home so I decided that I wouldn't revise and would instead, help out my fellow classmate which is struggling in a subject that I happen to know quite a bit about.

&#x200B;

""Helping her to revise? Don't bullshit me! You always try to be different and it makes me very irritated. Do you really think you have the choice to do what you want? Stop making the teachers pissed off, I'm telling you.""

&#x200B;

Apparently helping others is prohibited now? This makes me think that my school believes that competition is more valuable than cooperation. This suggests that my school supports selfishness and self-centeredness. I feel so helpless in this school, its like everything I do is wrong :( Every time I try to improve myself, the school raises the bar higher and finds even more things to criticise me about. This may work for some students but it genuinely kills me inside. It's honestly really fucking scary to see yourself getting weaker and more exhausted with every day that passes. The pain is immeasurable and I want to scream.

&#x200B;

And what the fuck was that about? What's wrong with being different? Oi, we are humans leh. We all have our views and perspectives and you, piece of shit, should learn to respect that shoudn't you? How the fuck are you able to know so much about me to be able to evaluate what's good and what's bad for me so confidently when you barely even know me? Go become a fortune teller lah.

&#x200B;

Not to mention that it's his personal choice to get ""pissed off"" about this. He is pushing his personal thoughts and opinions onto me, trying to use them to gain control over his students?

&#x200B;

\^\^This is the same teacher that separates me from all my friends for ""being a bad influence"".

&#x200B;

Why am I even responsible fo influencing others? Ever heard of victim-blaming in rape? Here's a scenario:

&#x200B;

A woman dresses in a way that exposes lots of skin; a man finds her attractive and rapes her. In court, the woman is sentenced to jail because she was the one that caused the man to rape her.

&#x200B;

\^\^Obviously, this is immoral and wrong, right? Becaue it's the man's choice whether to rape her or not and he has full control over whether to do it or not.

&#x200B;

AND, just like how its 100% the man's choice whether to rape her or not, it is 100% my classmates' choice whether to get influenced by me or not. Why am I being blamed?

&#x200B;

Okay la I know some of the things I've said about teachers and the education system is pretty bullshitt-y, but I just want to vent out my feelings. The purpose of this rant is to seek comfort from fellow Sinagporeans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could just seek a school transfer, but what's holding me back? My speaking problems. It gets so bad that I can't even say my name properly (Which is going to give my new school a pretty shitty impression of me.) so I'll just have to stay in my current school.  


It's a vicious cycle ;)

I'm currently serving NS as an ASA, and I like the job. But recently, about a week ago, for no apparent reason, I started feeling rather under the weather a lot. I don't really know how to describe it. Its kind of like a "" no motivation to do anything "" kind of feeling... It really makes me feel very lousy. I don't think its depression, mainly because I still feel happy during work. I still laugh with my friends and talk shit with them, only thing is afterwards that feeling of dread comes back in. I still enjoy my games at the end of the day and coming back to my bed. But its just that this feeling keeps nagging me. I can be happy but at the same time sad...And it really makes me exhausted sometimes. I think I might have an idea of what started it but I highly doubt it. A new guy just posted in and he happens to be my neighbour. Thing is, I remember him bullying me when we were younger.  I doubt this is the issue though as I surprisingly hold no grudge towards him at all. And he was already here for about a week before I started feeling ""depressed"".

6pezoy,tackyaf,"Brief rant on mental healthcare (advice welcome) So I just got back from studying abroad and am trying to figure out the whole mental health situation since I am on antidepressants and psychotherapy etc. These were inexpensive when I was a student because I was on university health insurance.

Here are some finds:

* There are no private insurers with comprehensive coverage for outpatient mental health treatment. 
* Medishield only covers inpatient mental health treatment, and Medisave only covers up $400 per year of outpatient treatment (which is like how much I'm projected to spend per month due to the no insurance thing)
* I could go to a polyclinic to get referred to a hospital for subsidized care, but people have told me it'll take months to schedule an appointment with a psychologist, and I kind of need one sooner/on a more regular schedule + am running out of meds, can't wait that long to refill
* Also I work for the government and seriously SERIOUSLY do not want them breathing down my medical records (this is me being extra paranoid)

Maybe I'm just being a privileged snob who's used to fancy university healthcare, but I'm just so frustrated on behalf of myself and everyone living in Singapore with mental illnesses treatable by outpatient care. I'm not overly concerned about myself because I'm living with my fam (~~because moving out is impossibly expensive~~) and can deal with channeling a nontrivial portion of my salary to keeping me somewhat sane, but I feel horrible for people who don't have as much financial security as I do. I don't know what the situation is like in other countries, so this is not a point specific to SG's failure or whatever, but yeah anyways. Ugh.

I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/) a while back and I've gotten so many kind responses from you all. Thank you for that. I thought the best way to try and begin solving this problem would to get my mum to see a counsellor. However, in the recent month, my relationship with my mum has deteriorated so much because I started being stricter and questioning her purchases. She now tells me that she's disgusted by my character cos I remind her of my dad. As of today, we haven't been on good terms for weeks and our maximum interaction per day would be maybe her shouting at me on 10 separate occasions. She asks me to shut up almost every time I speak or threaten me with violence/her health, so it's obviously futile trying to talk her into seeing a counsellor. Honestly, the way she's been treating me's so bad I considered moving out but it was always still just an idea I toyed with at the back of my head. Until today.

Today I was cleaning out my room and I moved my luggage that was behind the door cos I wanted to fill it with stuff to bring to salvation army. My luggage's behind the door and has been there for as long as I remember (my door thus doesn't open fully). Today I moved it out for the first time in months (seeing as I've not travelled anywhere) and this stench reached my nose and my heart just dropped. It was the familiar (to me) smell of dead cockroache**s**. I don't even know how many people on here would recognize that smell. FUCK ME 3 COCKROACHES RAN OUT AND THERE'S ROTTING WOOD FUCK IF U WANNA LOOK AT IT [HERE'S A PIC](http://i.imgur.com/6oMqGtX.jpg) 

Somehow, despite having lived with cockroaches for years, that just triggered something inside me. I think it's because. My room has always been a sanctuary in this shit hole I live in and now it's fucking compromised. I fucking give up. I fucking give up on trying to fix her. I want out. What the fuck did I do to deserve living in a house like this with a hoarder like her. Jesus??? u giving me a chance to be a fucking testimonial???? FUCK?????? WHY ME?????????? I'm fucking weak I'm not strong enough to take this shit 

Right now I'm seriously considering running away from home but I know the implications are going to be huge and my life would be completely messed up. At this point, I don't think it's teenage angst anymore and I really need to get the hell out of this place. It's fucking tiring to come home to this shit every day. I can't take it anymore okay. I can't stand being unable to open the main door more than 45 degrees wide because there's stuff behind it, can't stand seeing so much junk everywhere, can't stand going to the toilet in the dark and having to manually flush it with a bucket of water, can't stand not having a working ceiling light in my room, can't stand having to live in secrecy, can't stand THE FUCKING COCKROACHES.

I'm seriously considering leaving this house. Please give me advice if you have ever left home successfully or know of someone who did. Right now I have a few options:

* **Moving in with my dad**: I think this would be the most viable option seeing as my dad should still be responsible for me as a parent. I think he would be willing to take me in as well. But this option would be the most harmful to my relationships as my entire maternal side would see me as a traitor to my mum due to the sob stories she's always telling them. Despite my strained relationship with my mum, I'm very fond of my maternal cousins so I don't know if it's worth cutting them off for the sake of a better living place.

* **Moving in with an aunt or uncle**: My mum has 6 siblings, 4 of which are married, and of those 4 I would be comfortable living in the households of 3 of them. However, I'm really not sure how would I approach this subject with them, and if I would be able to carry the guilt of probably ruining their sibling relationship forever. Yet I feel like it may be easier to reconcile with my mum and have her realize the gravity of her actions should I leave to stay temporarily with one of her siblings.

* **Moving in with a friend**: This is my last option I guess. I'm not too fond of this option as it would mean putting additional burden on someone whom I'm not related to and isn't obliged to be so kind to me. However I feel like it would lessen the chance of my maternal family turning their backs on me and would also not compromise any of their intraextendedfamily(????) relationships.

* **Begging my school to let me stay in their boarding school**: This way I wouldn't be putting burden on anyone else except probably me to try and find money to pay the boarding fees. Just that idk if they would be willing to compromise to let a graduating student stay with them. (ps I'm 1 year closer to graduation than I stated in my original post ps)

I'm very messed up right now and unable to weigh the pros and cons and I feel fucking stupid for asking strangers for advice on this but literally any input would be nice because I can't think right now, all that's in my head is iwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveoutiwanttomoveout. I may delete this post in the morning if my brain clears up and I get this urge out of my system but I think there's a high chance it won't, as I am really fucking sick and tired of this shit. (edit: I have a 13 y/o brother and idk if I should bring him with me should I really move out. I'm a bit scared it will drive my mum crazy though since her whole life practically revolves around us. also my bro is closer to my mum than I am if that info means anything. and I've talked to him before about the state our house is it but he doesn't seem as affected as I am wtf? so idk what to do with him because I'll be worried about how the mum treats him too)

459oeh,rubbishbin01,"What's your opinion on people who cut off contact with their parents? I know of a friend who's been facing some serious (mainly emotional) abuse at home and I'm worried for her safety and mental health. She says that when she starts uni this year, she'll stay in hall and when she graduates, she'll find a place to stay away from her parents and limit contact with them. From what she tells me, I think it's kinda justified because her parents do say some really inexcusable shit to her.

It got me thinking, and personally, I think that while there are two sides to each story and neither side might be blameless, I feel like there's a limit as to how much filial piety covers and when the parents are overstepping the line, and sometimes cases of adult children cutting off contact with their parents can be quite understandable. However, in an Asian society like ours, I think what comes to mind for most people on hearing that someone is estranged from their parents is that they think of the person as 不孝顺/unfilial. So I just wanted to ask you guys, what do you think of when you find out someone are estranged from their parents? Do you maybe think it's justified, or if there's a middle grou"
3ojbwk,sgThrowaway010,"Advice needed Hello r/singapore. I'm feeling pretty shitty right now so please excuse a lot of things. I'm sorry in advance if I offend or come off as an ass. Throwaway bc I don't wish to associate this issue with my main account.

I'm currently 19 years old in poly going at internship. Due to reasons, I currently am living in a rented place with my farher over 60 years of age. He's going to be out of his hawker job in a month, and we are getting evicted because the lease is ending in the next 2 weeks. He doesn't own a house of his own, and I'm not legal enough to do so.

His CPF has less than 10k and his savings are unknown. It seems that he is counting on me to support him. I resent that, but will immediately start working my ass off after poly. I have no plans for further education.

I've tried appealing to HDB and they got back after 28 freaking days telling me they couldn't help me, period. No BTO, no rent. I'm SOL.

So, I'm feeling pretty shitty right now. I've been in this situation since I was 16, and I feel beyond stressed and upset. Every year we pack up our stuff and move. I want to do a lot of things, but space is always an issue and I never get around to getting the equipment and doing them. I try to be positive, but I have times like these where I cannot muster to fart a single rainbow out of my ass. I can't see a good future and feel like no one can help me.

In any case, I'm appealing for advice. To make shit feel less heavy. Is there any organization or people that can offer help? Fiancially speaking, I'm alright for now, but emotionally I feel like selling off everything and giving all that money to him and offing myself so he can have a good retirement life.

EDIT: apparently this post has been shadow banned. As for whether or not it will even be approved, I can't be arsed anymore. I need to focus on my intern.

9jmtio,damstereiw1,"I hate the kind of competitive mentality that Singapore's education system tries to instill in our heads. A friend of mine is a sufferer of this.

&#x200B;

Her grades weren't that good but she's constantly trying to improve herself by taking notes during class and studying individually at home. She's working hard but what does this education system do to ""reward"" her efforts?  


Every time she improves herself, the teachers just raise the bar higher and find more things to scold her for. It makes her feel worthless as no matter what she does, it is as though she is the worst of the worst and good for nothing.

&#x200B;

It creates this illusion that she is never good and no matter what you do you are still the worst - despite the fact that she is getting better and better academically.

&#x200B;

Her mother had fallen into this trick that her school has pulled on her and now believes that she is a horrible daughter.

&#x200B;

""When my mom fights with me, she locks herself in her room afterwards and cry about how horrible of a daughter I am."" my friend said. There's really nothing for her mother to feel depressed about but because of the lies and deception that goes on between the teachers and her, she gained a very biased and untrue impression of her own daughter.

&#x200B;

8e3zfy,RyanCMH,"Everything is going downhill and I'm having difficulty coping.. My family's financial situation is getting from bad to worse and I feel absolutely bloody helpless because I can't do anything to help..

I was born with around 30% worse hearing than normal and had to wear hearing aids since small. Because of something like this, I was often bullied and outcast in primary and secondary school. As a result, I developed depression and anxiety and dropped out of secondary school right before N-levels in 2014 to try and focus on an online IT business I had for a while.

Things didn't go well however and we closed in 2015. After that it was a roller coaster of finding a job that suited me, it wasn't that bad until I failed my probation for a job in the IT industry I really wanted, and I have been searching for a job since. A few months after failing my probation, my hearing got worse all of a sudden, with my left ear having around 40% hearing capability and my right having gone almost 100% deaf.

This severely limited the number of job options I had in the IT industry as I have poor hearing, and my highest qualification is PSLE. While I do have a few years of IT and customer service experience, it doesn't help much especially in a country like Singapore.

I really don't know what to do anymore, I feel bloody lost and helpless and a burden to my parents, especially my father. All I wanted was a job in the IT industry while studying part time and helping my family with finances, yet I just can't seem to have any luck.

Perhaps it's better if I just end things so my fam will have one less mouth to feed? I feel so bloody tired just living because of all these worries.

3kze30,help-me-understand,"What should I do about my girlfriend cutting? Hi all, I've been a lurker for a while now, and given the great advice I've seen others receive in this community, I thought it'd do me some good to listen to what you all think about a problem I'm currently facing. Pardon my English, I'm not as well spoken as you all here, and frankly my thoughts are in a mess.

Some background info: I've known my current girlfriend for more than a year, and we are really close. We meet at least once every two days, we've met each other's parents, and in general, we are just really honest and direct with one another. 

She used to be in a relationship, but as young immature boys are, her boyfriend lost interest in her and they broke up. She became depressed and cut herself. All these happened prior to me getting to know her, but I trust her 100% about what and why it happened. She had recovered by the time I met her, although now and then she feels depressed at night, but she always feels better the following day. She has not inflicted self harm since as well. (I truly trust her on this as we are completely honest with one another)

Then, last weekend, we had an argument, resulting in her leaving to go home. Over text, she told me she basically felt as if I loved myself more than her. I don't know whether it's true or not, but her reasoning behind it was ridiculous, so I felt really offended and mentioned that if she feels that way, perhaps it may be better if she found someone else. I didn't want things to end with her, but the feeling of being accused of not loving someone when you do makes you so helpless and inadequate.

We sorted things out, and I found out that she bought a blade to cut herself when I brought up the idea that perhaps it's better we don't be together. At this point, I am completely overwhelmed with rage and despair. She sent me a picture of her cuts, and while they were not likely to leave scars, the very fact it's self induced drives me crazy. I am unable to respond to her with the amount of patience and understanding I know I should have; all I feel is anger, as if she took the easy way out in dealing with emotional pain in a relationship. She told me it wasn't because of me that she cut herself, but because of her own need to ""distract herself"". That still doesn't change the fact she was able to abstain from self harm for over a year, and returned to it because we argued.

Looking advice up on Google gives me info applicable in a different context. Most sites teach you how to bring up the topic to a friend who is a habitual cutter. For me, I have no issues bringing it up, I just don't know what to say, what to feel or what to do. Also, she isn't a habitual cutter, she only cut when we argued. I'm so sorry for the long post guys, but I'm really lost because I have no one to turn to. Any sincere advice is appreciated, thank you in advance.

Edit: Also, I don't want to have to worry about her cutting herself whenever we argue. It'll make me give in to her all the time for fear she'll do something to herself, and I don't think that is good for a successful long term relationship. As a person who suffers from anxiety, I really can't handle the idea that she may be hurting herself, it's a extremely horrible feeli"

I was wondering if anyone here has sought psychiatric help before? And how much it costs?

Reason I'm asking is that several people I know have mentioned that I should seek professional help.

The downs last far longer than the ups, and the longer I stew in that, the worse my mood becomes, to the point of going through thoughts of suicide.

I just froze -__- I would really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.

7v33d2,shian243,"What had been your biggest regrets in the past? For me, it would be not picking up more arts, skills and sports when I was a kid.

I wasn't so much into studies, but I wished that instead of throwing me into more tuition as a kid, I had gone for more CCAs, more sports, music etc. and I wasn't sure which one to join, so in primary school I was in scouts (which I didn't put alot of effort into) and in secondary school it was a whole bunch, Youth flying club (kicked me out after day 1), Band (didn't even know how to play and the next thing they wanted me to do was play in concert, wished there had been more guidance), taekwondo (wasn't interested back then) and the last one because Sec schools die die want you to have a CCA, art club. We did jackshit every session. Wished I had paid more attention to learning photoshop back then also. 

I wouldn't call it a regret since I had no say, but I wished my parents saw that there was another way aside from studying, and pushed me more into the arts. Or sports, I really liked badminton but I never found the chance to get in, when school trials were tough.

Hi! The last time I posted anything, it was a short update on the daily thread that I'd moved to my dad's house.

I'm pretty fortunate compared to anyone who might find themselves in a situation like mine; somehow I've been lucky enough to get a scholarship that not only covers my university tuition fees and accommodation, but gives me a monthly allowance on top of that. So I've only lived with my dad for a short while, and I now have my ""own"" place (staying in a hall in uni) where I am pretty comfortable and happy. :)

It's been almost 6 months since I've left home, and I do not regret a single day since I've made that decision. Occasionally though, I will start to think of my mum and question if I should attempt to reconcile with her. However, thoughts of her abusive words and actions never fail to make me die a little more inside, and thinking just of the state of her house makes me shut down all thoughts of reconciliation.

While she has always doted on my brother more than me, he doesn't do as well as me academically and I fear that she will soon put immense pressure on him since he's taking his O levels next year. Reading the post about the teenage suicide rate being the highest in 15 years sent a chill down my spine as I have ever thought of suicide, and, while I want to believe otherwise, I'm fairly certain my brother has as well. Not only is my mum a hoarder, the amount of pressure she puts on me academically is really quite interesting (e.g. I got 262 for PSLE– it wasn't enough for her as I was brought home and very very harshly reprimanded and then made to feel ashamed of myself for at least a whole year after that).

And while the idea that academic success isn't all that matters have somehow started to dawn on her seeing my brother not do as well as I did for PSLE, she continues to pressure him by sending him for not only tuition but instrument classes for 2 INSTRUMENTS as well. My brother was one of the main reasons holding me back from suicide, and I cannot find it in me to see him be put under all this unnecessary pressure without doing anything to help him. He's ever told me he's very stressed because of my mum and then broke down in front of me. It breaks my heart as an older sister.

I want to help him eventually find a way out of that hellhole too, but one thing's stopping me– what will my mum do?

She has been unemployed ever since I was born (I'm 19), and most of her life has revolved around taking care of her children (and also her late mother) from then on. I now know this is not really the norm, but she receives quite a lot of alimony from my dad (it's quite a few K) and hasn't actually *needed* to work. Yet she tries to earn passive income, and consequently has been involved in, I kid you not, at least 5 MLM schemes. Obviously, none of them succeeded in making her a billionaire and honestly have probably made us poorer. lol

Right now, other than presumably taking care of my brother (I wouldn't quite know, haven't exactly spoken to her in 6 months...) she spends a LOT of her time involved in church activities. But other than that, I don't know what she's doing with her time. Probably making jewellery that she'll never sell (I'm not trying to be a smartass here. This is a very factual statement.) or watching TV. 

If I ever one day help my brother away from her, I really don't know what she will do. If she can text me things like ""I wanted to jump down the 16th floor when I found out your dad had another woman 10 years ago, but I didn't because I had two young kids. I think now is the time."" after I'd left the house, can you imagine the possibility of her actually following through those words when her other child leaves as well?

I don't really know what I can, or *should* do. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice. For those that have followed my story since the start, thank you for your support over the past year. "
4rq82j,childrenofkingsman,"Need help protecting myself/ignore Hi all. I am a JC dropout and am currently waiting for NS. For the past 2 years my sister, in her early twenties, has been routinely shouting at me and my father almost every other day at the top of her voice. Some days it's laughable nonsense: the other day she was shouting about how she believed in Black Magic and that there were people out there who were using it to make sure her life was ruined. But most days, she keeps shouting about how me and my Dad are ""OPPRESSING"" her and that we are MALE PIGS WHO WANT TO RUIN HER LIFE.

Over the last 6 months she has made 2 police reports against me, claiming that I am harassing and physically abusing her. I have done no such thing. I have not even spoken to her in 3 months, since she made the 2nd report. The police have not followed up on the reports.

She suffered from OCD for a few years way back. But she received treatment for it and has recovered. But in place, a demon has taken over. A demon that won't stop shouting, won't stop just stop fucking shouting and screaming and banging the doors

Today, she accused me of raping her and threw a glass at my father's head. And I think she has made the third report. I don't know what to do. My father has been suffering from depression for the past 2 years and yet this cunt won't leave him in peace. He doesn't beat her, doesn't do anything. All he does is watch TV after getting home from work. And she can't even let him do that. We are not well off; my father doesn't have a good education, and she taunts him for it everyday, cursing him for not having enough money to pay for her diploma (despite the fact that he helped her get admission), for being a loser and a failure, and not buying her new things ""like all her friends""...And it goes on and on...Any attempt to talk rationally to her is useless. Any.

Please advise on how to protect myself. I have made some sound recordings of her hurling abuse at me and my father, but that's probably about as far as I can go in capturing evidence without further provoking her. 

It's only been getting worse over the last few months. I think it's been affecting my mental health as well. I can't concentrate on working and learning things while there's a monster in my house who shouts at the top of her lungs every single day. I don't know. I don't feel like doing anything.

At one point I didn't even leave the house for 2 weeks, sleeping 14 hours a day. My diet consists of instant noodles and $1 donuts and . I've thought a lot about leaving this house, but where would I go. No money, no job, no nothing except my maybe declining mental health and some books lying around and the love of movies to keep me from opening my veins. I wish this cunt would just die, I really do. I don't know. She told me she would spit on my grave when I die and wouldn't shed a single tear. I told her the feeling is mutual. She proceeded to lunge at me. She says she's sworn on her grave to make my life a living hell, to ruin any dreams and endeavors in life that I wish to undertake. Toxic. I don't know. I have no one to talk to IRL; no shoulder to rest my head on; no one who really loves me, not even my own mother. I'm learning to come to terms with my crippling loneliness. But some days, like on this one, it becomes unbearable. Feel free to report this off and ignore it. I just needed to get it off my chest.

It's now 2 am, she just started again. By hurling a textbook on my sleeping father. Another hour of routine shouting. Come to think of it, I'm probably just as flawed as she is. I don't kno"

3oqafn,sgthrowaway_1,"Daughter of a hoarder. Hi /r/singapore. Throwaway because I want to ask for some family advice and I think my classmates know my main account but not of my situation. Also, I'm posting this not in /r/relationships or whatever because I don't think a lot of people from other countries will understand that I can't just move out when I'm 18. Maybe I will after this, idk yet see how.

Very long post warning.

I'm a 17F living with my mum and brother in a condo in the east, currently in a certain IP school. Background of my family is that my dad left the house one day in 2010 after many years of arguments and unhappiness with my mum, and they got their divorce finalised in 2011. 'Many years' cos she found out he was having an affair in 2002, right before my brother was born. The affair continued til around 2013, I think my dad now has a new woman but idk and this is deviating from my main issue.

One of the main things that my parents argued over was that my mum had too much stuff and my dad couldn't stand it. He would ask her to throw away things and she would get emotional saying that he was intruding into her personal space. As a child, I wouldn't understand their arguments and I would always side with my mum as I hated my dad for having an affair. He would coop himself up in his bedroom (my mum slept in the same room as my bro and I) saying that he didn't like to see the mess outside, get angry at her for buying new books (will elaborate later), clean up and throw away some of the stuff she bought while my mum brought us children out, take pictures of my mum's stuff as 'evidence' for her hoarding, and I would always be angry at him for being 'mean' to my mum. However, in the recent few years, I have found myself to be repeating his actions and thoughts, though I don't verbalise them as I know how much it would hurt my mum if I were to be rude and treat her how my dad did. I spend 90% of my time at home in my own room because it makes me so upset to see the house outside in such a mess, and I've begun cleaning up the house while my mum's out but I don't think I can singlehandedly bring this house into a liveable and pleasant condition.

Let me explain why I consider my mum to be a hoarder. She buys a lot of stuff with the mentality (or at least how she tries to justify her purchases to me and my brother) that she did not have a lot of stuff when she was growing up, thus she wants to provide the best for her children. I honestly don't think the 'best' means having lots of material possessions, but she seems to think otherwise. This is especially the case for books. I grew up with a love for books that was encouraged by my mum. We would step into Kinokuniya, Borders or PageOne and buy easily 20 books at one go. During Popular book fairs we'd easily spend $300 in a visit. I thought this was normal until I grew out of seeing my mum as a saint and realised that we have a crazy amount of books. In my living room, there are three bookcases that are filled to the brim. We have one bedroom that's meant to be a study room and we have two very large and full bookcases in that room. One of the bookcases fell and we've not been able to open the door. I haven't stepped into that room since 2011. In my bedroom, there's one huge bookcase and one smaller one, both completely full. Also, my mum's FUCKING WINTER CLOTHES take up an entire cupboard in my room. Keep in mind she hasn't visited any country in the winter since I was fucking born. She also has a big IKEA cupboard/desk combination that she uses to keep some of her Junk™ (which I will elaborate more on later). Since my dad moved out, you'd expect my mum to live in the master bedroom, but NO. That room is filled with more books in toyogo plastic containers and More Junk™. I have asked her multiple times to please stop buying so many books, but she always plays pitiful (imagine a 45 year old woman acting cute to get your sympathy. sorry mum I try my best to respect and love you but it's fucking disgusting) and gives me a few stock replies (I just want to provide the best for you/It's not your money why are you concerned/These are good books, you can read them after I do/You can keep them for your kids). Yes, she buys preschool/children's books even though my brother and I are 13 and 17 respectively. When we (my brother matured well and also knows this is abnormal) ask her why, she'll say that we can keep them for our kids, and she likes the colours and pictures so she bought them. Wtf????????

It's not only the hoarding of books, but that she refuses to throw away electrical appliances or broken stuff that we literally do not use anymore. Imagine having a broken portable air conditioner in the middle of your kitchen or a broken luggage outside the toilet LOL. AND SHE HAS SO MANY 'POTENTIAL WAYS OF EARNING MONEY'. She's involved in two MLM schemes - Summit which sells some kind of compression stockings at $100/pair and magical magnetic mattresses at around $3000 if I'm not wrong, and Nefful which sells negative ion (?) clothing that's very expensive. But she isn't an aggressive saleswoman, so we've had a lot of unopened stock in our house for YEARS. In addition to that, she makes jewellery to sell, spending thousands of dollars buying supplies like Swarovski crystals, beads, charms etc. at Chinatown. She keeps all this in more toyogo plastic containers in the living room and in the IKEA cupboard in my room. Then she also sells t-shirts which Christian logos that she gets from a supplier in Malaysia, and this takes up the entire wardrobe space in the master bedroom. She also tries to do mosaic art, thus we have so many glass pieces and those kinda shit in MORE FUCKING TOYOGO PLASTIC CONTAINERS IN THE MASTER BEDROOM. All her DIY shit would be fine if she actually sold it, but the problem is that she fucking doesn't. I've tried to sign her up for flea markets, but she would say that she's too tired to set up shop. Then I've asked her for some stock so I can take pictures of it and sell it online, but then she'd say that she's too lazy to find stock for me and it's always ""another day another day"". And then she blames me that I'm not helping her to sell her stuff and that's why the house has so many things. ?????what???????????

This hoarding has really brought about so much inconvenience to all of us. In my house, you can't walk in a straight line for more than 2 metres. There's so much stuff that it's embarrassing for anyone that isn't the 3 of us to see our house. I've never had friends over (wah wtf when I finally get a boyfriend he can't come to my house), and if our neighbours are outside, we wait for them to enter the lift before stepping out of our house just so that they won't see the insides of our house. The curtains in the house haven't been drawn since 2010, when the hoarding wasn't as scary as it is now (aka when my dad was still here to make her mildly wary of buying stuff), save for those in my room as I actually try to keep my room neat lol. My mum and bro sleep in the living room on the sofa and a mattress on the floor respectively. I used to sleep outside too until I decided I wanted to sleep on my own bed, so I cleaned the bed in what was supposedly my bedroom (it used to be covered with laundry and soft toys ????) and now I kinda have my own room, if not for the fact that 1/2 of the stuff in my room are my mum's.

Due to being ashamed of showing other people our house, we have never called professionals to fix our problems (plumber, electrician, exterminator etc). As a result, we don't have a working light in our toilet and the flush is broken too so we fill a bucket with water in the sink and pour it down the toilet to flush. The shower heater is broken too but that's a minor thing since I've gotten used to it. I once accidentally said to my friends while we were out that I ""wanted to go home before the sun sets to shower"" and I got damn weird stares LOL. Explained it away like it was some weird quirk I had instead of just not wanting to shower in darkness. Our washing machine broke 6 months ago and because of the ashamedofourhouse thing, we can't get a new one delivered and installed. Honestly, even if we weren't ashamed of the mess, there wouldn't be space to move the washing machines in and out. So we've been handwashing our laundry for the past 6 months wtf. I haven't watched TV at home in years because something's wrong with our TV and Starhub box but we can't get them fixed. We have a total of 5 aircons in our house but none of them are working.

Everything would be tolerable, if it were not for the **FUCKING COCKROACHES**. We've always had a minor cockroach problem at home, and before my dad left he thought it'd be a good fucking idea call an exterminator and ask them to spray the gap in the ceiling toilet (the construction of this condo is quite poor) with lots of pesticide or something. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. A few months later, dad had left the house and the ceiling started peeling. Cockroaches would rain down from the fucking ceiling. Cockroaches would crawl up from the fucking drain. Silhouettes of cockroaches would be seen in the fucking ceiling light. So we just decided to abandon ship, turned off the water supply to that toilet and use only the master bedroom's toilet. If I were to open that toilet door now, what I'd see would be the walls dotted with cockroach shit, floor littered with dead/half-dead cockroaches, and the smell's godawful. It doesn't stop there. Sometimes the cockroaches manage to escape from that room, and other times they'd crawl (presumably) along the wiring or something and appear in other rooms. I suspect there's a somehow a tunnel leading from the cracks of one of the tiles to the master bedroom toilet because the cockroaches appear from the fucking cracks or doorframes or what. FYI, these cockroaches are usually about the length of my thumb, and I have large hands for a girl. They are why I avoid going to the toilet at night and keep my toothbrush in my room instead of in the toilet. Cockroaches have appeared on my clothes wtf. I once cleaned the kitchen (while my mum was out ofc) and found a FUCKING CHAR SIEW COCKROACH BEHIND THE OVEN. 

The only good thing I can imagine coming out of this is that I'm not scared of cockroaches LOL. During a school camp the girls were showering in the toilet and suddenly this girl from the neighbouring cubicle shouted ""AAAHHHH GOT VERY BIG COCKROACH!!!!!"" and all the other girls started screaming LMAO. The cockroach crawled to my cubicle and I'm like lolwtf it's the size of my fingernail nia u haven't seen big cockroaches yet. And stepped on it effectively ending its life (with flip flops on la I've not reached *that* stage yet), and they called me a hero LOL. My house doesn't have a lizard problem though, so future boyfriend u can still be my hero if we're near a lizard ;)) (so much for feminism) (fuck eh my sense of humour so stupid I trying to talk about serious problem still can tell joke)

Mentally, this has definitely taken a toll on us as well. The mum frequently tells me that me and my bro are in deep shit if she dies cos then we'll have to clean up the house ourselves. She also often says she wishes to just die quick and painlessly so she doesn't need to deal with this tough life, and that the dad ruined her life. She's borderline emotionally/verbally abusive towards me and my brother too. Not sure if facing this shit everyday is what makes us sad and depressed people but I'm bipolar and I once had a panic attack at home. She hit me while I was hyperventilating and asked me to stop acting like that 'in the name of Jesus' (I go to church but don't really consider myself to be a Christian. more like going cos she wants me to go). Will not elaborate any more on how we are all mentally fucked up but let's just say we don't have those kinda upper middle class instagrammin' mother-daughter relationship that all my friends have. Typing all this info as I would like to ask for advice on what to do to even alleviate this problem in the slightest way possible, given that throwing away my mum's useless stuff while she's out or telling her to her face that she has a problem isn't a viable solution because she's very emotionally volatile, always victimising herself and generally I'll be putting both of us in danger if I do anything rash and drastic. She's one of the unhealthiest people I know, and as much as I hate the condition I'm in, I do not want her to have a mental breakdown or a heart attack.

I'm looking forward to entering university where I'll try to stay in the halls so I don't need to come home but that's two years away. I'm really so tired of this. Where do I draw the line between being respectful and filial and having enough of this shit?? Any advice from anyone, especially if you have dealt with hoarders, would be much appreciated. Considering posting this on /r/relationships or /r/hoarding too, maybe later.

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR, I live with my mum who's a hoarder, and our house is in such a godawful state including a cockroach infestation. I can't do anything drastic cos that may trigger something in her. Advice?

Edit: woah I just came home and read all the comments, I really wasn't expecting so many people to offer such encouraging words. Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice, I'll take them into consideration in deciding what to do next. As for those who were wondering, yes I would say I'm quite well off (at least before the dad left us?? not sure if I would consider myself well off now??? agh). My mum gets an alimony of ~$6000 per month and complains that it's not enough and that the dad is shortchanging her.....????.>.?>."

I fell sick with an illness for 2 years but never told anyone in school.

But I haven't even made a single friend. I can't help but feel like a ghost everytime I walk down my school hallways.

To tell you about myself, I'm a quiet early-20s guy who never had a room to himself. Over the years I have tolerated sharing the room with my sibling, but as of late I am at my limit and even the smallest thing he does (not having personal space as a person who values being alone is one thing, living with someone who's an ass is another) can set me off (not that I really go into a fit, I'm a master at bottling up my emotions but I guess that makes it worse huh). I don't see how I can survive like that any longer. And I just recently finished NS, which was my first source of income. I'm abit more adventurous when it comes to money so experimented with it abit.

Of which they require space, time and  being away from the judgy or kpo eyes from my family (which is definitely always there since I have no personal space). 

Dont get me wrong, I love my family and home, but recently I find that I just need my own personal space. Not to the fault of anyone, it's just human nature I guess? I don't know if I can wait until 35 and marriage doesn't solve the issue since it doesn't really give me space, does it...

I'm sure many out there are in worse conditions (family abuse etc.) so I'm wondering how you survived too.

Over the past year or so on this sub there’s been an increase in the number of people asking for advice/help regarding mental health issues. 

Practically, it’s not possible for those experienced in these matters to reply to every single comment from each daily thread. Hence, I’ve decided to make this thread to consolidate some of the common answers to those seeking advice regarding getting help for mental health in this country.

My post will be geared towards seeking help from public institutions, as I’m not familiar with how things work in the private ones.

I’ll try my best to be as objective as possible in this post, but as someone who’s been dealing with issues of his own lately, I’m compelled to share some of my personal experiences and observations as well.

********

# In case of an emergency:

If you’re suffering from suicidal ideation or are otherwise in distress, and need someone to speak to, you can call the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS)’s 24-hour hotline at **1800-221-4444** or email them at pat@sos.org.sg. 

If you or someone you know are at danger to yourself or others, **call 995** immediately or **walk-in to any A&E Department** at any hospital. 

*****************

Suicidal feelings are temporary in nature, however permanent they might feel presently. The important thing is to keep yourself safe by any means necessary during this period of crisis. If that means you need to be hospitalized, then you should be willing to do so for your own safety and well-being. 

If you are deemed to be at physical danger to others or to yourself by the relevant authorities and professionals, you may be detained at IMH for up to 72 hours, or longer, under the Mental Health Act. This happened to me after my first suicide attempt. Yes, it sucks, but it's not as scary as it sounds. 

Currently, the only public hospitals which offer **inpatient** psychological and psychiatric care are IMH, NUH, SGH, TTSH, and CGH. 

Your mileage may vary on the quality of treatment and care that you’ll receive at IMH. If you do not wish to seek treatment at IMH, you can always ask for a referral to a hospital of your choosing. 

Outpatient psychological and psychiatric care is offered at all hospitals, but not all treatment options are available at every institution. 

*****************

# FAQs:

Q: I’m in need of professional help but am having financial difficulties. What should I do?

A: If cost is an issue and/or you do not require emergency care, you can get a referral from a polyclinic to see a psychiatrist as well as a psychologist at a hospital of your preference. If you are a youth (aged between 16 and 30) you may obtain a free and confidential mental health check from [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/about-chat/who-chat/). 

You can ask to speak to a Medical Social Worker (MSW) at the hospital you’re seeking treatment at to possibly obtain subsidies. Subsidies of up to 100% under the Medifund scheme is available for Singaporeans.

Health is and should always be top priority - both physical and mental. This is Singapore. You will not be thrown out of the hospital because you don’t have any money to pay for medical treatment. 

Financial help is available. Getting it can be tedious, frustrating, time-consuming, annoying, but that’s the inconvenient nature of all bureaucracies. And please do remember that the professionals helping you are not your enemy--the illness is; and the golden rule applies everywhere and to everyone. 

Q: I’ve been feeling really (insert relevant adjective) these days. Am I suffering from (insert relevant disorder)?

A: None of us here are qualified to answer this question. We can only commiserate, empathize, provide emotional support, share our perspectives/views/opinions with you as well as respond to the specific issues you’re facing. To get a concrete answer to this question, you will need to consult with a psychiatrist, which would be beneficial for you (and your loved ones) in both the short and long-term. 

Q: Will there be a “record” which will affect my employment/scholarship/school admission prospects if I seek treatment from/am admitted to IMH? 

A: No. Your medical records are private and confidential. 

Q: Will I be discriminated against in employment/scholarship/school admission applications because of the fact that I have been diagnosed with and/or am suffering from a mental illness / disorder?

A: No. Your medical records are private and confidential. However, should you choose to disclose your condition, do know that discrimination might be a possibility, and that it does not reflect your worth as an individual should your application be rejected. 

&nbsp;

***************

&nbsp;

Stigma against mental illness and those who have them is still prevalent in our society and countless others around the world. The most effective way to combat this is by educating the public about mental health. Things are improving, but we still have a long way to go to ensure that individuals suffering from mental illnesses are not subject to undue prejudice which may impede on their recovery process. 

The first, and most important thing you can do for a loved one who is suffering is to simply listen to them. Don’t just post an empty, meaningless hashtag on social media to affect your empathy towards those in distress when in fact you may have none. Talk to them, ask them how was their day and if they’ve had something to eat. When was the last time they went out to do something fun? What are their interests? What is currently upsetting them so much that everything in life just seems so pointless, meaningless, empty, futile? That each day is filled with so much misery and angst and anguish and pointless suffering?

No one’s asking you to take responsibility for their well-being; and in many cases it’s not healthy for you to do so even if you may wish to. Just listen. More often than not, in the process of talking and thinking it out, individuals in distress find the answers to these questions of their own accord. The process and road to recovery may take a month, a year or perhaps even a lifetime. But the important thing is to keep moving ahead, one step at a time. 

For those in distress, I can't promise you that things will get better, nor can I tell you that you shouldn't kill yourself. It would be morally unjust for me to make that decision for you, because this is your life, after all, and you get to decide what to do with it. But what I can say with the utmost conviction is that the good days, though they may be few and far between, are worth living for, no matter how ugly the bad ones get. 

I hope you can find the strength to pull through your period of crisis.

And please remember to take care of yourself. Be kind and gentle to yourself When you’re in distress, suffering from an illness so unbearable it makes you not even want to get out of bed each day, even the simplest of tasks may feel Sisyphean in nature. Take it one step at a time. If all your day consists of is you getting out of bed and taking a shower, then that’s great! Do that again the next day, and the next, and the one after that. Then, take the next small step and make yourself a healthy breakfast. Find comfort wherever you can find it. Allow yourself to indulge in your favourite books and movies and video games and other activities. Try to go out for walks and just soak in the sights and sounds of your neighbourhood. Notice the little things. The leaves falling off the trees. Kids jumping around and chasing each other in the playground. The roar of the motorcycle. The heavy sigh of the stopping bus. The smell of the earth after a heavy rain. If for nothing else, these are just gentle reminders that life exists. That you exist. And that there will be a tomorrow and that the sun will rise again no matter how dark the night gets (barring the heat death of the universe, but that’s a whole other topic altogether…). 

These little things may not seem like much but they do make a huge difference, especially so when your brain has tricked you into thinking that nothing, nothing, nothing matters anymore. That it's all worthless. But it isn't. Your brain's lying to you. There still are things and people worth living for - and you are one of them.

You are worth it, and don’t let anyone, or anything, even the stupid illness, tell you otherwise.  

Listen: I've been in your shoes one too many times and I know just how much it hurts. The constant agony of vacillating between wanting to live and wanting nothing but death. I want to say that you don't have to go through these struggles alone. Professional help is available if you need it and especially so if you really want it.

So stay safe, and [take care](https://i.reddituploads.com/81b1167bca5f4253802e399771798329?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=650ade81000e686612bfb7217dbc8d7e)! 

And share your story; talk about it without fear or shame, for you have nothing to fear and nothing to be ashamed of. I can’t promise to read them all, but know that your voice and your story has not gone unheard.

3auoam,EastLight,"Damai Secondary 4 student hangs himself in flat, family distraught [Article](http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/damai-secondary-4-student-hangs-himself-flat-family-distraught)

---

For reasons unknown, a 16 year-old secondary 4 student from Damai Secondary School commited suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his own room. He was discovered by his parents, who had knocked on the door of his room several times before realizing something was amiss.

According to neighbors of the family, the suicide took place last night. They had reported hearing anxious knocking on a door for several minutes before hearing loud wails from the mother. Concerned neighbors who had gone up to the family to ask what was wrong were informed by the father of the boy that his son had hung himself.

The secondary 4 student was described as a distant boy by neighbors. They said that the family had 3 children, a daughter who studies at a local polytechnic, and a younger boy aged 9. When probed further, neighbors recalled that the deceased was more reticent because he would hardly greet others when he met them as compared to his older sister and younger brother.

The parents and the sister of the deceased boy were in the mortuary today to identify the boy's remains. The mother of the boy was emotional and refused any requests for comments while her daughter placed her hand on her mother's shoulder to comfort her.

Police have confirmed they are investigating the case as ""unnatural death"".

Would like to take this post to tell the suicidal/ depressed people of /r/Singapore that you're not alone and there's always someone to talk to in time of needs. Please seek help from professionals. 

I don't know your story, your past, or the circumstances that led to this very moment but please know that even the glimmer of hope and chance of you going on could lead to something you might never have imagined.

Rest in peace to the student who decided to take his own life.

382as8,SomeguyinSG,"Help/Advice Wanted for me, a socially awkward guy. Hello r/singapore,
I lurk around on this reddit most of the times, sometimes coming across threads where people post their personal issues and sometimes the responses given are truly helpful and compassionate.

Hence, I have decided to speak up and pluck up the courage to talk about my personal issues as a result.
Sorry if my message comes off as blunt and impersonal, but it could be the way I phrase my message/content :<
Forgive me if my words seem very awkwardly phrased as well, because even as I am posting this, I have my doubts and uncertainties because I generally don't have enough courage to speak up, be it in public or online.

Okay, so first off:

1. I have low self confidence/esteem and sometimes suspect I may have mental issues
This has been a problem with me since young, as I can never seem to have enough confidence in myself. Additionally, sometimes I feel that I have mental issues because of how easily I get anxious and stressed out over the smallest of things. 
I heard that if you wanted to be checked for mental issues, the government hospitals may indicate that on your medical records and it may affect your likelihood for employment in the future, is that true?
I decided to see my school counselor(s) this year, albeit with not much change yet, although I know change doesn't happen overnight, but yeah. 
Sometimes I also feel so depressed over my studies and workload (especially this year) to the point of giving up school, and thoughts of suicide have came across my mind, but only to pass through quickly, because I know that its foolish and not the way out.
However, that being said, even though I am worried about my studies, sometimes I still find myself procrastinating and spending a few hours on end on YouTube and etc., so I'm not sure if this is just me being lazy or really a serious issue beneath.


2. I have very poor socializing experiences and interpersonal skills.
I would say this happened because of my previous poor experiences when interacting with people, my family background, my personality and etc. 
Moreover, I was bullied in primary and secondary school (poor experiences when interacting with people)

As a result, I tend to be very hesitant to express my emotions openly as I fear that if I delve too deep into a relationship only to have that relationship end, that amount of hurt it gives me, because I am someone who treasures the few relationships I do have.

3. I have a rather strong distrust of people around me. 
This is related to the above point of me being socially awkward and because of my lack of socializing experiences. I tend to shun away from people and social situations because it feels weird and foreign to me to be attending one, and because I lack the experience to do so.

For points 2-3, these have affected my ability when participating in group projects, because of my inability to communicate/interact/behave? properly around people, which is a crucial problem for me considering the amount of group work I have to do.

All in all, I don't know what to expect from this thread, but if its mostly negative replies, then I don't really know.. It could just be me being lazy? and not being a proper person.  I don't know... I just feel so troubled at times. I'm not even sure whether people will take this thread seriously...

*I'm currently having exams, so apologies for my late replies...

Edit: 

As of 2nd June, I have read every comment here and I am grateful for the replies so far.
**In case this thread gets removed/old, I will post more threads in the future to ask about how to improve myself, I really appreciate the comments you guys have posted so far**
Some answers to the comments though:

Some of your advice has been given to me as well, like 
1) talking more often to people I know, however, I still have my reservations, but I acknowledge that I do need to attempt to talk more often

2) Its true that my low self esteem makes me feel even worse about myself when I'm watching YouTube or reading reddit, but sometimes I feel that its also me putting off the tasks that I actually need to do (procrastinating). It varies a lot for me though, I could spend as long as a whole afternoon from 1pm-5pm doing stuff that I shouldn't be doing

3) With regards to my anxiety issues, it has affected me in a few ways:
a. Interacting with people (I get discouraged easily after a ""bad"" experience (from my perspective) with someone, and makes it very very hard for me to talk to that other person again)
b. Trusting people
c. Academic performance [I have a cumulative GPA around the 3.5-3.9 range for the first year (2 semesters), and yet I still have no confidence in myself, panicking during exams, like being unable to finish my papers] 
Moreover, this year has been quite bad for me, because its the first time I'm doing Problem Based Learning (no lecture notes, create your own notes)

With regards to my counselling, most people have also told me that they don't think I have mental issues. However, my main concern now is about how badly my anxiety will affect my health, as well as my daily life.

All in all, I'm just worried that I can't handle the stress and break down, drop out, because I kind of use my stress in order to force/motivate myself to study and perform to the best I can.

\- Negative attitude towards military personnel.

Sit down on mrt also cannot, too sweaty and smelly also cannot. Why can't they be respected more like how Taiwanese people recognise their military's sacrifice.

Sorry for posting but I'm honestly not sure how long I can still hold on. 
**Can you please recommend some good places/people/things to do that actually help with depression/anxiety in Singapore?** (please no imh, horror stories)

I've suffered from depression for many years after being ostracised in secondary school. It was pretty bad, boarding on the fringe of physical bullying. And even after many years, I still get the occasional nightmare about them/""the main bully"" or nightmares about school related things. Sleep is often disrupted even though I havent seen them for years, and even though things at school may be okay/ even if I'm not schooling.

I've been struggling with self love for many years. Each night, I attempt to suffocate myself in attempt to get some relief. I honestly wish I could be dead. I have nice parents, but they don't seem to know how to help when depression hits hard. I'm always suffering alone.

I've already tried several counsellors/psychiatrists/therapists in Singapore. One in the secondary school I was from, one from another school, one public counsellor (who felt like they didn't care at all), and two private psychiatrists. Each time, they all might have worked somewhat at first, but eventually stopped caring/ being understanding. 

My most recent one is the one I've been getting my meds from, but they scolded me when I told them about my wishes to die every night. I've tried exercising (jogging, swimming) but I'm at the point where I'm too sad to try.
Eating nice food helps, but only for the moment. Art, animals... a lot of things only seem to help for a second or not at all. It doesn't solve the actual issue.

**TLDR; Any recommendations of good therapists / things to do / self help methods to try to help to cure depression? Thank you.**

2rax2s,BeepBeep33,"Guys, I need serious help... Hey all,

Bit a about me. I'm 27, moved to Singapore last year for work. The excitement upon moving here was overwhelming, the life and cultural experiences I would gain, the professional advancement, the chance to travel. I was finally getting rewarded for years of hardwork with my company and given a chance to see the word and grow. It all sounded incredible. The reality however, is that I felt isolated almost immediately. I am relatively inexperienced for the specific field that I am now working in and I learned it real fast. I've been advancing quickly, but I have felt like an outsider the entire time. My insecurities towards my professional life have made it extremely difficult to network and develop a friend group, and has led me down a path of constant anxiety and depression. Now, a bit of a backstory about me. When I was in college I tried my hand at online poker. Despite the fact that I had no bankroll management skills, I developed pretty quickly into a strong player. I continued to play and play and play, always making loads and busting it all. I was lucky to cash out any amount. Anyways, I thought those days were long behind me until I moved out here. To cope withy anxiety and depreesion, I began gambling heavily out here. And I mean very heavily. On the weekends I would find myself at mbs or sentosa playing blackjack for 1k a hand, betting sports online for several thousands...I have depleted all of my money that I've earned from my job, so I turned to money lenders. I don't gamble anymore, but I continually have to borrow in order to pay back existing lenders. It's crazy to think that I make over 10k a month and can't get a loan from an actual bank. The interest rates on the money lender loans is killing me! I have talked with my parents and they can only offer their love to me. This year I'm going to start seeing someone about my depressive thoughts and unhappiness. Work wise, things are actually going well. I still very much feel like an outsider but I've been making great improvements despite the way I feel. I really need help out of this deep dark hole, but truth is I have no one to talk to or that will listen. I owe 19,800 in money lender loans, and I have 75 dollars in my bank account to make it until February. No idea what I'm going to do....anyways, thanks for reading and if anyone out there wants to chat I'm fre"

5y1l6d,lyrajc,"Singapore, a place where a gruesome murderer gets only 10 years jail under ""brief psychotic disorder"" reasoning Hey /r/singapore,

I've recently came across this article circulating among my circles, just wanted to start some interesting discussions with you guys.

http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/security-guard-jailed-10-years-for-killing-fiancee-by-trying-to/3544006.html

I'll impose some questions:

* What do you guys think of the pardoning of sentences by the courts due to mental illnesses?
* Do you think people like these should be treated equally as a completely sane individual?
* How do you feel about the sentencing of this case?

Personally, I myself am surprised that he got only 10 years. What happens if he repeats the crime again after serving his jail time? Maybe IMH might deserve some benefit of the doubt by being able to suppress his mental illness, but still, there is no absolute way of saying he wouldn't revert after he is released. By the way, after you read the article, I don't understand how it was ""brief"" psychotic disorder, it totally wasn't brief at all.

Maybe serious crimes like murder shouldn't be treated any differently whether you are a sane person or not. Either way, you had the intentions to kill someone and that is enough to be a danger to the community. But I guess it begs the question, what is the level of crime would be considered serious?

Inb4 post too serious, downvoted to oblivion :P

I guess I do have to also mention that I do not study law and psychiatry, but nevertheless, I enjoy a good open discussion on this. It's also quite educational to me.

436v51,Beoulve5,"Disillusioned, Disenchanted and DGAF I'm a 25 years old guy and just graduated in mid-2015 from a pretty decent university in UK. I used to be so driven and set lofty goals but lately I just feel so jaded and disillusioned with everything. 

Took the first job offer that paid the most right out of uni (banking / consulting etc, don't wish to be too specific). Had a terrible 5-6 months there of late nights and the excessive stress caused me to turn to anti-depressants.

I cracked and resigned, telling myself I will take up an ""in-between stress-free"" job somewhere and continue finding something I like. I'm currently working on my ""in-between"" job and applying furiously to every opening I can see.

In truth, I just have absolutely no idea what I want to do in life. I tailored my entire academic curriculum and internships to pursue the coveted consulting / banking path and everything went out of the windows in <6 months. I felt the ""lost in life"" moment on one 2 am night when I was working on a powerpoint deck and looked to my left and saw my 40 year old boss beside me doing the same. For the life of me, I couldn't picture myself doing the same til 60.

My new job is relatively stress-free and I leave office around 6.15pm although I had to take a near 50% pay cut. It's not what I want to do for the long term and staying is out of the question. But my life is a complete rut now:

Go to work, go home, watch some tv shows and movies, hang out with friends on weekend. I'm single, have no girlfriend and literally spend the day waiting for time to pass. I no longer have any motivation in life and I can't find a single thing that inspires me. 

The thought of the rat-race makes me nauseous and interacting with my friends (who are fantastic people) reminds me how everyone seemingly has it all together and I'm simply wasting my life away in a pit of emotionless, mindless emptiness.

2lgoo8,Brine127,"A Singaporean kid's thoughts and troubles Hi, i'm fairly new to reddit and especially to this sub, so I hope nothing similar had already been posted..
Singapore had all along been labelled as a stressful and competitive country, and i think we all as Singaporeans know it's true. I just want to provide some troubles and thoughts i have about the education and living here..

First of all, schooling itself is already a big competition. I think we all know how stressful students who gone through the PSLE were, especially the ridiculous expectations from parents and the stereotype about 'neighborhood' schools from the society. And we are not yet talking about O level (or N level), something which i have not personally experienced and thus not daring to comment anything about it, but i already know how tough and stressful it is going to be. However, this isn't really my point.

As a Singaporean student, we spend at least 6-7 of hours in school per day. And then we start to add up co-curricular activities, one could easily be spending 11-12 hours in school, twice or thrice a week. The rest of the days in a week where we get to be released in the afternoon (say 2 or 3pm), it will (quite often) be taken up by supplementary classes, meetings or consultations with teachers. After all these, we come back home at night, and will then be faced with piles of homework which are expected to be done in a short span of time. There are also tuition classes arranged by parents often.

Recently, all these things has really been taking it's toll on me. I start to find myself lacking time to even relax or take a breather. I find myself lacking time to get a life, chat with friends, meet up and hang out, or even get to do things i like. I start to lose joy in life.. If at this age i'm already feeling so overloaded by these things, i can't imagine how i can face it when i grow up.. Eventually i'll reach a point where I have to use results to compete for seats in a local university. Things are highly priced over here, we can work 10-20 years to fully pay for an apartment, not to mention fighting for jobs, feeding a family, and the list goes on..

But back to the topic, Singapore's education may be one of the best, but at the midst of it, i've felt so much stress, competition and suppression, to the extent that life kind of lost it's meaning for me. I no longer get to relax, enjoy and live my life, and judging and hearing on what is going to come when i grow up, i do not think i will get to relax, enjoy and live my life in the near future either. So then, what is the point of living my life? 

Even though not everyone have the same views about this, i am pretty sure some people would feel the same way as me (from talking to friends, families and so on). I hope i could receive advice as i guess i've really nowhere else to go to speak out my views. Thanks for reading and i hope i could seek thoughts from you gu"

sorry if I'm not supposed to post this kind of post, will take down at mods' request. using a throwaway so that I don't accidentally doxx myself. sorry for horrendous phrasing/expressions, I'm not in the best frame of mind. 

Oh boy, where do I start? 

I'm a sec 4 express student taking the o's this year. 15M from a single sex secondary school somewhere in central (?) Singapore. 

I regretted joining this school from the very moment that I entered it's code as a 2nd choice for secondary school admission. those elusive 4 marks in my t-score were to change my life for the next 4 years, for the worst. 

I didn't brace myself enough for Sec 1. I was from a school environment whereby insulting/name-calling wasn't entertained within the student cohort itself. But here, it seemed to be a fucking class - no, level - tradition. The amount of insults and bullying I received in the first two years.. fucking hell. (to put things into perspective, I am an overweight guy who used to be emotional - to the point of crying - during my first two years in that school). 
they were so dedicated to bullying me that they created whatsapp groups to spew all sorts of shit about me. new insults about my family members, offensive memes, etc. 

somehow made some good friends, they fell to the dark side and turned against me. Oh boy was that fun to go through. all my personal stuff being thrown out in the open and used against me. 

tldr: it was a royal clusterfuck of (insert other swear words here). 

at the end of secondary 2, I was so excited to leave this class. I had lost my chance(s) to contribute to my school (couldn't be a prefect since I didn't attend a prerequisite leadership course, didn't attend my UG cca's trainings regularly during Sec 1 and 2 and subsequently made myself unable to get any exco positions, didn't get anywhere near entering the class committee for both years). But whatever, new Sec 3/4 class, mostly new people to get to know, new friendships blah blah blah. No pure chem/phy for H2 at JC level? Isokay man, just get an A1 at O's for combined science and iz all gud.

I wanted to graduate from this school, being remembered for good things and whatever. 

Things haven't been going as planned, however. 

I easily socialised with many of the people in my new class. Found some cool people to get to know better. But over the course of my Sec 3 and even Sec 4 years, I started to distance myself from many people in my class. 

Conflicting interests? Maybe. 

Introversion? Seemed like it. 

I came to realise that I wasn't bad at socialising, I was actually pretty good at it, but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with. 

This didn't exactly serve me well. Many people in my class thought I was a stuck up piece of shit or something to that effect. 

I guessed that graduation wasn't going to be what I thought it would be. 

Apart from that, there were the handful of retards that took joy in making my life harder than it was. A few of the fuckers from my Sec 2 class, were unfortunately, smart enough to enter into my mid-tier class. Tried to curb my social life within my class and all that shit. And there's the others that thought that repeating my name in weird voices around and behind me would be so fucking hilarious. (for the record, I have a pretty uncommon name - uncommon enough to be made into a joke apparently. I even went to the extent of asking my parents to change my goddamn name, but to no avail so far). 

I started to develop a bad rep within a sizeable chunk cohort, even amongst people that I didn't know personally and vice versa.

I don't even know many of these fucking people and they made (and still are making) fun of me for things that I am and things that I'm not. 

all I want now is an L1R5 of >10, a place in my JC of choice (affiliated w/ my current school) and my teachers' appraisal. everything else can rightfully fuck off. 

No hate against this school tho, it's school culture is amazing and lives up to what it's termed (**[redacted]** - I think that's a big clue already haha). This same culture is imminent in the interconnected primary school, secondary school and JC, and that's why I want to continue my journey in the affiliated JC. 

In a way, these 3 and a half years of hell have been beneficial. I came to learn about my true psychological/socio-emotional limits, learnt about different types of people, learnt how to discern between good people and bad ones.

8pquof,onetimethrowaway94,"[Serious] depressed and at wits end Hi fellow reddiporeans,

I've previously been diagnosed with major depression and have stopped my medication and seeing my psych as I've gotten better.

However in recent days, things have been very bad. I went overseas with my family but every single moment of it was a torture for me. In the past when I was seriously suffering in my room, my mum knew but she just came in to check and simply walked away, it felt like he didn't care. My siblings know about my issue but they can't do much about it and I don't expect them to. They have their own families and I understand that they would come first. Now when I have problems, I have no one to turn to. I can't talk to my siblings like I don't even wanna tell them about it because they can't do anything and I no longer feel close with them anymore. as for my parents, they never did understand me and would never know.

I have a girlfriend, but I felt like I'm not doing her justice. When I see her I see a girl so deserving to be cared for, to be happy. I tried to give it to her but apparently I don't think I can. In fact I may be adding onto her burdens. I feel bad because other than her there's no one else I can turn to but it's not fair for her because I'm broken and I don't think I can be fixed. It'll suck but I'm going to talk to her and ask how she is, if she would be better off without me, I'll do it. For her sake. Sometimes when she pms she doesn't want to talk to me, when she has issues she doesn't want to approach me. I guess I ain't the correct person for her.

As for myself, I'm still studying and have visited school counsellors and external counsellors from clarity and have been receiving treatment at imh. I can't even be bothered about the social stigma anymore because I know I am broken and that I need help. I desperately want to become better but no matter how I try, it doesn't seem like it's getting better. I've called SOS so many times and talked to them but it all hasn't helped me. I ain't too close with my friends in school because honestly, none of them cares. 

This few days I've been struggling, I feel like I've been having my buttons pushed to my limit. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of breaking down, it's like a goddamn rollercoaster where I'm okay for 20min and sad for the next few hours trying to hold back my tears.

I would say that I'm a person who self-pity myself a lot. I want to be loved, to be cared but I just can't feel any of it coming from anywhere. I really want to get well and get back to normal but my treatment and counselling just can't help without support from those around me. My parents don't know what to do with me and my siblings just tell me to suck it up or that it'll get better and what I really hate the most is when all of them tell me that I need to walk out of it. I may be a little bit spoilt(maybe) but what I really want is just someone to be there but I can't find that person. Some of you may say, be glad your parents are still around and your siblings still talk but that's the thing. To me, it doesn't matter if they are or not. I don't feel anything from them. I want to recover, I want to walk out, but I don't know how.


Tldr: op self-pities and have tried all ways to recover but is still broken.

For those wondering, yes I have talked to my parents and they don't know what to do with me which I don't blame them because I know I'm a mess myself. For my siblings, I hate my brother so much because all he does is just aggravate my emotions and make me even more unstable. It's dark and it really sucks.

I'm very lost as to what I should do in life.. I posted a year ago and my depression got the best of me. Things haven't been going very smooth lately and I find myself having no means of improving my life without educating myself first.

Like I said, I am a secondary school dropout. A quick tl;dr of my life would be that I grew up in a shit family, met the wrong people, got led on the wrong path. I've never done anything great for myself and have no friends. This is the one thing I want to do to set my life straight.

My current goals are to take all my exams with Pearson. Singapore universities, or polytechnics recognize the certs. They have the iGCSEs, which is the O-level equivalent and A levels. I plan to study most of my days off for the next 10 months in time for the exams in June 2017, enrolling in an online course which covers English, Bio, Chem, Science, Maths and History.. afterwhich I will spend 2 years studying for A-levels.

Is this plausible? Even so/If not, are there better alternativ"

5020jx,aimlessnsf,"Depression issues from army, please help. Throwaway account for privacy reasons. Also, wordwall.

Before I entered the army, I was a relatively happy and cheerful guy with no problems whatsoever. Took things as it came and go, didn't really feel stressed, depressed, or burdened by any problems that I encounter in my life.

Fast forward to where I am now, I enlisted in the army, and now I'm a totally different person. I'm a miserable wreck, easily stressed and moody about any issue that I face in my daily life. The former me is long gone, it's as if I have totally changed to a different person. I've become an extremely pessimistic guy who cannot think of anything in a positive light.

When asking for help regarding my situation around my friends previously, all I got were the typical ""lan lan suck thumb"" responses, with some even saying that it's just an easy way of ""chao keng"", and accusing me of doing so. I know that's the standard Singaporean mentality and way of handling it, and maybe it works for everyone else, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Due to my terrible issues, I probably have pushed away most of the friends that I have had, with only some remaining, and I do not know when they might give up hope on me. I've also talked to my parents about it, with my father just thinking that I'm weak, before going on to talk about how ""back in my day, I had to do xxxx while you just do yyy"". My mother has helped me somewhat, but I still feel extremely bad everyday.

Pretty much everyone tells me that these 2 years will pass by faster than you think, but when everyday passes by at a snail's pace, that doesn't seem to work. Everyday I am just stuck here doing meaningless tasks which I do not see the point in. I do not have any goals, any aims, any motivations in my life. I do not have any sort of drive whatsoever to keep me going. The urge to just take the easy way out has been creeping on me steadily. Although I probably do not have the guts to do it, I fear that one day my brain might not think rationally anymore and I might just give in.

I fear the few hours before nightfall - the fact that I have to sleep on my bed eventually haunts me. I fear the time when I eventually have to get on my bed to sleep - the fact that I will eventually wake up to the ringing of my alarm clock eats at me. I fear the morning - it's the start of another day in this system, and I'm not getting out anytime soon. It has gotten to the point where sometimes out of nowhere in the mornings and nights, I just break down mentally and tears start to fall, and I just feel terrible. 

The family and few friends that I have now have advised me to either go see a psychiatrist, talk to my superiors about this issue, or talk to a SAF counsellor. I am at an utter loss of what to do right now - I know that there is the stigma of people reporting about depression in the army being labelled as just ""chao keng"" and that they won't treat you seriously. With people also telling me I am at a risk of being charged for malingering for reporting such issues to my superiors, I doubt whether or not I can trust my superiors when I tell them about this issue. I also am worried about what will happen to my future - if I seriously am diagnosed with a problem and have to go to IMH to get a record, my future job prospects will be ruined, and obviously getting a record isn't good at all.

2jft4w,needlenoodle,"What's SG working life like? I started working at an F&B ""start-up"" place about 2 months ago. Really horrified at the amount of corner-cutting done by the owner and how bad her judgement is, e.g. she makes a lot of health and safety decisions that very barely pass govt regulations (even when given the chance to spend more money and be safer), outright lies and scams the authorities in order to retain her license, makes the employees do a LOT of things that are not within their job scopes, and manages to convince herself that all her decisions are perfectly acceptable even when employees got so disgruntled that they staged an intervention for her. (Can elaborate if you guys are curious but it's a bit difficult to describe the place as it is very easy to guess from additional details.)

I'm a uni undergrad and this is my 3rd part-time job. Most of my colleagues are also student part-timers.

Was just wondering whether this is basically what working life is like and how SG managers usually are? Lai share share.

Please be frank about whether I'm being too idealistic in expecting businesses to be run more ethically/optimally. I think it's probably not the norm for SG businesses to think so much as long as the money is coming in. Can anyone comment?

I don't want to waste my parents' money more than I should, so please, tell me, is it necessary? Are jobs, even low ranking ones, difficult to find without degrees and diplomas? Will I still be able to live decently, at least in a small apartment, and don't splurge?


I know I can't handle it now, but I may come back later, once I go for therapy, and try to get it under control. Right now, not to be a drama king or anything, but I'm genuinely afraid the stress is going to drive me to suicide. I think about it everyday, but am too scared to do it.

There has been articles of employers giving a petty sum to helpers for their food budget. Articles about giving helpers instant noodles and white bread daily. Reports of helpers going mad after being abused and killing their employers.


IMO my main reason would be that Asians have been drilled that money = power. That if you don't get a good job you are inferior to others that do. Thus since they're paying their helpers salary they project their power dynamic and see their helpers as ""useless"" ""stupid"" ""inferior"" etc.

Thanks :D So im 21 this year, i have another year till i end my days in poly and my days are numbered for national service. My reasons for leaving home i guess are the same as most people i know nowadays , abusive relationships with family. By abusive it has never been psychical But mental to a point where depression and I'm Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and Athazagoraphobia(fear of abandonment) as i was adopted into this family. needless to say since young harsh words has been thrown at me be it because of something drastic or to just not being able to help out with technological issues or simply just unable to understand some of the letters that appear in the house time to time. 

No matter what i do to help out at home, i'll always get this from my dad ""you're useless, all you do is nothing at home"" even if i've been woken up by them in the middle of the night just to fix their phone cause they turned off the wifi or mobile data without realizing it. 

There's a chinese saying that ""家家有本难念的经"" which simple translate to "" Each family has its own problems"" I just want to explain that moving out isn't a act of teen stupidity or just at the heat of the moment. 

I'm aware that i will be all alone if i were to make the move right after NS, So im just seeking for advice or just some tips from the people who unfortunately are in the same boat as me.

8nqiw5,littlesuperherogirl,"Thank you to the TransCab driver I met yesterday. For some reason there's a lot of scrutiny towards the TransCab drivers here but I just wanted to share what happened to me yesterday-

In short I was in a horrible place in my head and when I boarded the cab I was already crying (not the kind that you can discreetly hide lol I was outright sobbing already). Instead of probing he gave me a pack of tissues then we started talking about why I was crying.

At the end of my trip I realised they don't take card or NETS so I said I will get his number and make a bank transfer in the next 10 minutes since I don't usually carry cash around. This is my fault because I should've asked if he took card/NETS as payment before I boarded. However the driver uncle told me he will waive the fee and even offered to drive over to the coffee shop 5 mins away to get me a cold drink.

I couldn't accept his offer (and started crying more bc I didn't expect such kindness after a really shitty week) and gave him all the cash I had, which didn't even amount to half the trip fee. I'm glad he accepted it and I'm glad I met + spoke to him.

I still hate myself for not getting his name and car plate number so I can make a formal compliment to the cab company.

Before I left he said, life is always about balance and ups and downs, see girl, you had such a bad week but now you meet me and i'm good!

6u0l9a,bloodandroses,"Need advice on school, I'm at lost at what to do. Hi, I've been looking for advice from friends but would like to know more about people who have went through with similar scenarios and would like to seek advice from you guys.


A little bit of backstory, I graduated from Nitec with a GPA of 3.7 and decided to apply for poly straight from nitec (BAD CHOICE) in a course that I thought I was interested in. Turns out I havent done enough research. I've always been a hands-on learner, always been a very slow learner when it comes to theory so being in ITE really benefit and taught me a lot. Sometimes I do force myself to sit down and study, even watch video lecture that poly provides so you learn at home. For some reason I just dont have the ability to do that, half way while watching the video lecture and I'll start daydreaming even at home. Some goes when I'm in a lecture in school, my attention span is really really shot. I do force myself and try not to daydream or stare into blank space but it seems like something that is wired into my DNA and few seconds later I'll be back in dreamland. This short attention span of mine was already a thing back in secondary school where teachers would scold me for daydreaming in class hahaha.


The problem I have right now is, I realised that I've completely given up on poly. I dont have the drive to study, nothing motivates me to keep on going. Results are getting worse each time and this course is heavy on theory that I cant even keep up anymore. I have asked my lecturers for 1 on 1 session with them, it helped a bit with catching up with classes I guess..  Now that exams are around the corner, I dont feel motivated to study and I just generally feel like I've already given up. Which is why I have chosen to drop out of poly if I ever fail this exam as I hate take the idea of having to remodule the modules I'm currently taking.


My original backup plan is to drop out of poly and server my NS, after that I would probably get a full time job while doing part time diploma in a course that I'm interested in. I have a friend that is currently on this path, but studying part time in ITE instead. What should I do? To those who have dropped out from poly and went on this path, what are you doing right now? Do you regret your decisions? Having to deal with this everyday is killing me very slow"
32saai,sgdrugsthrowaway,"From a drug addict. I come back to see a [legitimate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/32noxm/what_are_the_legal_implications_of_recreationally/) downvoted to oblivion. Addiction may not be something that can be so easily treated, some of our actions are oblivious to ourselves while we are sober. Or perhaps, some of us are silently self-prescribing medication for ourselves, and you'll never know, because said medication makes us seem like normal.

So fuck the ones who are downvoting a legitimate question from a user. I know we are a reclusive society when it comes to drugs, but know that an addictive personality is not something that most of us would want, but it's just something that happens much like anorexia and the such. We can't control it. 

Thus, whenever we see a fellow much like us in need, we try not to shun them, but instead provide advice on harm reduction. We know how they feel, if they would want to get high, they would get high no matter what the short or long term repercussions are. 

Helping people like us to get clean is definitely a solution,  however, downvoting questions from us to oblivion is definitely not helping us at all. If you've never walked a step in our shoes, and I sincerely hope you'll never, please direct us towards proper help instead of shunning us; ostracising us; ignoring us. We could for all you know be your best friend, your colleague or even your family member. We could be high functioning addicts that are suffering so much in silence that you would never know. So, for the majority of us who have been quiet, please give us a chance to seek help, or please do direct help onto us. You'd never know how effective it might be to have a fellow human being telling you ""hey, it's time you seek some help"", instead of getting your queries unanswered and ignored. If we were your child, your brother or sister, your best friend, etc, would you treat us with such indignity?"

> Sympathy, tears, shock and disbelief were just some of the reactions. But all things considered, should we be surprised when such a suicide occurs?
 
> Kim was a star. He seemingly had it all - fame, fortune and success.
> 
> But let's take a closer look at what else we know about him.

---
> • He was male. And when it comes to suicide, gender differences abound. Since 2010, the ratio of male to female suicide deaths in Singapore has been approximately two to one. Nationally, more males than females die by suicide every year. This is in line with the trend for many developed countries.  
> 
> Interestingly, it is believed that significantly more women than men attempt suicide. This is known as the gender paradox in suicide.

---
> • He was 27. Among young people aged 15 to 29, suicide is the second leading cause of death globally, after road traffic injuries. In Singapore, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people in the same age band.

 --- 
> • He was struggling with his mental health. It was reported that Kim confessed to ""depressive feelings"" his entire life in an earlier magazine interview. A note he left a confidant also surfaced his feelings of hopelessness and despair. 

> Mental health and suicide are closely related. Those grappling with mental health are at greater risk of suicide than the general population. How many people truly understand the sadness and feelings of depression that overwhelm a person? Depression can be devastating and requires support from professionals, family and the community.

--- 
> • He was in a high-pressure environment. In his line of business, there is overwhelming pressure to succeed, with celebrities having to account to their label, fans and team mates. At the same time, criticism and feedback are swift and unforgiving.

--- 
> Kim's death is the most recent in a year that saw several high-profile celebrity suicides, including those of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington.
> 
> But he could have been anyone who experienced emotional turmoil with suicidal thoughts which ended tragically in death.
> 
> Suicide can and must be prevented. It is a public health concern which claims individuals from all walks of life, ages and cultures.

> Given that Singapore is a relatively stressful society, it is easy to brush off the stress students feel as something that everyone faces during his schooling years.
> 
> While stress is inevitable and some stress will motivate us to work harder, it is also important to note that too much stress can be potentially harmful, not just to our physical health, but also to our mental health.

> Currently, there appears to be very little awareness of mental health in schools.

9d2isl,fool168,"Sudden realisation: no one actually cares about you, you're your own best friend. There have been up and downs in life for everyone, recently, it has been my down. Financially and health wise both I am not doing very well now, I lost money in investment and only have less than 10k net worth under my name. Health wise, due to long term smoking, I have been experiencing bad cough and breathlessness. But, yesterday is the final straw.

Long story short, I had food poisoning yesterday night and I had no one beside me to accompany me to the clinic /A&E. So  I had to drag my sick body to the clinic myself, limping on my way to it.

I lived with my brother and when I called him for help, he said he is busy and ask me to go clinic myself.. I do have a few friends but it didn't even come across my mind to call them for help....

So I had a sudden realisation that I ONLY have MYSELF to rely on. There is this chinese saying,  锦上添花易 雪中送炭难 ( Not worth mentioning the icing on the cake, but for help in the snow ). When you are doing well, you will suddenly have a lot of friends around you, coming to congratulate you and leech off from you. When you're in deep shit, you are alone, only a few true friends or relative who will really help you selflessly, without asking for anything in return.

Thank you if you are still reading up to this point, do anyone else feel the same? If I am the only few who felt so, this thread will be buried and gone for good\~ and I accept that.

EDIT: didn't thought that this thread will blow up. I welcome everyone to comment whether it is positive encourage or the negative ones. Many thanks to the community!

2lr2x9,benningtonsoon,"MC on BMT I am serving my NS now, the confinement period. My PES status is C9L2. I am physically fit and I'm very particular about fitness. Unfortunately I fell down 1.5 years ago during gymnastics and fractured my wrist so that explains for my PES status. They said it's a temporary PES because I will have to go for a surgery to fix my broken wrist, after which I may be able to up my PES status.
Life is honestly very boring being in PES C and excused from upper limb exercises. I can't even play captain's ball. WTH. I'm just sitting down for most of the physical activities which I find that time pass even slower.
I understand from my sergeants and officers that to up PES I will have to retake BMT again to go through field camps and leadership training etc. I feel that it's so troublesome to go through everything again. So maybe I'll wait till my BMT is over then I'll fix an appointment for a surgery.
However yesterday, my third day of confinement, I slipped and fell forward. I landed on my injured wrist and that was it, it started hurting real badly. It was painful, but it's bearable because I'm used to the pain that my wrist have given me throughout the 1.5 years. I asked to see the MO because I wanted to get medical gel to apply on the injured wrist. That didn't happen but instead they say they'll have to send me to mainland to do an x-ray. I was thinking, hmmm mainland means I get to go home and probably got a few days MC off. That's not bad...
Then BAM... when I saw the doctor, they gave me 3 WEEKS hospitalisation MC. I knew I am screwed. The MC ends on 1st December 2014, which is 1 week more of BMT before I'm posted to vocational training. I'm really depressed now as I don't want to serve another round of BMT. I can't do shit because in the army the doctor's words are final.
I'm wondering if there's anyway I can do to not retake BMT?
Honestly why do they have to give me 3 weeks MC and I have to stay home? Why can't they just give me a few days off then let me get back to camp and sit through the 1 month of BMT in tekong? Besides, I don't get to do any physical activities also during BMT and I can't get out of home... so why can't I just be there to sit through so I don't have to retake BMT?
Please help me! I'm so depress"

9laz0u,futureresearcher_,"We need to show sensitivity to the intern involved in the recent SPH affairs incident She attempted suicide and almost died. 

We do not know what has happened, and I do not condone what she has done if she did something wrong. Maybe she was coerced into a relationship (she is a scholar what means that she cannot leave if she doesn't like it). Maybe she did it out of her own free will. 

But she deserved to be treated with sensitivity and compassion and not to be slut-shamed. 

---

EDIT: 

She was a scholar. Means if she not happy, she cannot leave easily. I can relate in a way cos there was a time I was really unhappy with someone, she is a real bitch to work with but I also realized I cannot leave easily. Luckily it was only for a few months then I said bye bye to that bitch in a polite manner.

Sexual coercion do happen. The two editors could have used their influence over her to pressure her to have sex. If I were in such a situation, I would leave because sexual coercion is hard to prove and you see even the big boss of sph at most demoted them. So if you brought it up to the SPH HR ""organically"" (claiming being pressured to have sex by your boss) forget about it lol.

Anyone have more info or explanations for these? 

- Why did it take 5 policemen to go to the school to pick up the kid? 
- Why did no counselor or school faculty member contact the parents immediately? 
- Why the school let a 14 yr old kid go to the police station alone? Can't wait for the parents to come in and accompany him? 
- Lastly, the policemen interviewing him, couldn't they wait for an adult/lawyer before taking his statement? How will a 14 yr old ever know what his legal rights are?

&#x200B;

""Yes, your CPF monies are safe as all CPF monies are invested in securities (SSGS) that are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government. ""

&#x200B;

[https://www.mof.gov.sg/Policies/Our-Nations-Reserves/Section-IV-Is-our-CPF-money-safe-Can-the-Government-pay-all-its-debt-obligations](https://www.mof.gov.sg/Policies/Our-Nations-Reserves/Section-IV-Is-our-CPF-money-safe-Can-the-Government-pay-all-its-debt-obligations)

&#x200B;

Anyone who's been in investment for sometime knows that there is no such thing ""guarantee"" in investment, there is only high chance of returns or low chance of returns. There are a lot of words in this page talking about AAA rating, ownself praising ownself, even I can call myself AAA, meaningless words like secruities, and all that jazz. But one thing they didn't mention is EXACTLY which stock they are using CPF to buy. Is the stock so good that it will never be bearish? 

&#x200B;

Which brings the question, what exactly is the government investing in? Are the persons handling CPF money foreigners or Singaporeans? Names of these ""AAA rating"" Investors? Is this why there is a rapid increase in inflation in Singapore? 

&#x200B;

There are 2 unethical ways that the government can guarantee an investment positive, forced conscription\[Or some form of slavery one form or another in or outside the country\] and taking advantage of uneducated financial idiots. By forced conscription I'm talking about NS, anyone who is born in SG(or outside\[or not since not all foreign males go NS before allowed to work in Singapore\]) and is a male know what forced means, there is no choice.

&#x200B;

If you don't know how real investment works, don't comment on this issue. Real investment compromises not just one but a combination of a number of factors, for instance, political stability in a country. You can't open a club without a bouncer.

&#x200B;

NS is a cheap sham for defense, $1/hr. The only things holding this scheme is patrionia(myth), greed, selfishness and dog-eat-dog society thanks to Defense Minister has created. It doesn't make sense, the females during the song dynasty practice foot-binding as a sign of beauty, should it be brought back today just because it was mandatory?  There was a pitiful $100 NS50 voucher given in exchange of 2 years financial damage loss of \~$30k, it's pretty pathetic. $2k-$560=$1.44k, $1.4kx24=$34,560. + Opportunity costs may be up to $100k.

&#x200B;

Singapore's Patrionia is a myth because workers in Singapore's army are overpaid, If patriotic is the main reason for National Defense. Then, there is no need for officials working there to be paid $5k, $10k, $50k/mth. While NSF are paid measly of around $560/mth for 2 years, about $1/hr. If you reduce the pay scale to maximum $1k for all workers, you will see how many of the rats in the army will run. Power is given to money, thus patriotic is a myth. Officials are more often than not, paid much more than they are worth. With NSF deaths happening annually, suicides, unhappiness, garbage tier attitude shows Officials care little about ethics and citizens, but about themselves and their paycheck. This is not surprising as they know the nature of the business is to force males born in Singapore to ""Serve"" ""National Service"". Can't be anymore sarcastic. Anyway, people working there will come here very soon to disagree without logic as their masters are holding the checkbook. 

&#x200B;

There is a movie called ah boys to men, but in reality, it's ah men to pussies. The movie shows little gullible boys to be beta bitches. Not revolt against the low paying, garbage treatment policy. It distracts the public of the real problems NS can cause, sabotage, death, financial ruin, etc. No matter how you shift the equation, NSFs are the losers in this equation.

&#x200B;

You may argue PM serve NS, but bear in mind that he has million dollar salary now and most likely knew he won't have any financial problems whatsoever after. Which ""ordinary citizen"" here is going to earn that much money after they finish forced conscription? Probably not you. With foreigners and PR taking even your diploma level jobs and government jobs now in Singapore, you won't be guaranteed with a good job position after you are out anymore. Foreigners are cheaper so why hire Singaporeans? Singaporeans need money to buy leased HDB, Foreigners work for a few years and retire back home. NS is to protect against foreign invasion, but they have already invaded the island legally & openly stealing your rice bowl, fail.

&#x200B;

The value of a citizenship is based on the % of foreigners in a country, and the difference in treatment with citizens & non-citizens. Close to 50% of people in Singapore are foreigners, and rising, since birth rate is very low, and there is no real difference in treatment except some small discounts for citizens here and there. It doesn't even have the power of dual citizenship like most countries. The Value of Singapore Citizenship is very low, all the less reason to be patriotic. 

&#x200B;

As for uneducated idiots, I'm talking about taking advantage of people who have no idea how trade works. For example, day trading, study 1 day graphs to see if it will go up using some lines learnt from some con person on youtube. Or maybe telling our neighbor that water can't be measured by money but by years of benevolence, hilarious. Same thing said for National Service, officials pay lip service saying National Slavery is a ""Privileged"". But at the backstage, have expensive cars, going overseas multiple times a year for holidays, living extravagantly, laughing with their huge paycheck in the bank.

&#x200B;

Or you know, ""Donations"".

46wh99,Nidsan,"NS Down Pes E9, Bipolar Disorder, Career in Government and MNC? Just a bit about myself.


Some background
I'm currently serving in NS as a clerk.
I graduated from a local Polytechnic, high GPA, one of the top students ( received awards, distinctions etc)
Received awards from minister, and Mendaki Anugerah awardee( Yes I'm Malay)


Admitted to the Local University I wanted, NTU and into the course I wanted(Materials Engineering, Skipped a year. Taking an additional minor too.


Prior to NS, I was doing numerous free-lance jobs and external projects on my own, building websites, working for overseas companies and getting offers of that sort, made a few businesses of my own, I made a flyer business, ecommerce, investments in shares. Didn't really sleep much and felt really energetic and was working almost all the time. Joined a few High IQ societies out of boredom too and out of grandiose beliefs. [ This is reminiscent of the Manic phase in Bipolar)


Enlisted to NS Sep 2014
During National Service, I suffered from severe depression ( or so I thought), I was feeling down and I thought it was normal for everyone else too, I had all these thoughts about being a loser, not being worth anything in life and delusions of having problems girlfriend problems, financial problems, social life problems and I had trouble having any sort of cohesion with anyone, most do not like the type of conversations I usually employ and I was out-casted. 


At the same time, I felt so angry at the world, as if my issues were both projected inwards as well as outwards blaming the world. Feeling so stern inside yet having the ability to break at any point.
Due to the nature of my behaviour in camp and just lack of any confidence in myself and the fact that I couldn't pass my IPPT, flunked my Sit-test, I was posted to be a Security Trooper, my depression worsened and one day I broke down in training and started crying on the floor. I suppose my terrible vocation had a part in my depressed mood. 


I was moved out of training and was queued for MMI.
Months later, visited MMI, after several interviews and tests, I was informed I had bipolar disorder.
The usual route for Bipolar Disorder was a straight Pes F and was told it was via directive.
Of course, I declined and with the fact that they said I had a bright future, we made some agreement to circumvent it so that I can continue to serve as Pes E9


Some months later in my new vocation as a clerk, my condition worsened again, despite having down pes and being a clerk, I was still crying for months, sometimes hiding in a room, in the corner, or in the toilet. Trying not to get spotted. I attempted suicide too but failed.


Then one day, this year, I was caught in my act, a few hours later I was warded to IMH ( so now I have an IMH record) for a week.
Sent back to MMI, got so close to getting Pes F again, my parents had to beg the doctor not to let me Pes F due to the severe consequences of not serving NS. 


My condition is stable now, I take regular exercises and try to be more conscious of my thoughts, take a few supplements too. 


But the fact that my PES is E9 and my condition was for F, as well as the IMH record.
Do I still have a chance to work for a large MNC or for Government?



TLDR;
Got Good academics, Diploma and local Uni degree.
Down-Pes due to mental health
Can still work in government"

What helped me was seeing my doctor regularly and talking things through. Don't be so quick to crap on the value of dialogue. If it's genuine, you really can use it to cut through the crap and figure out how it is you can go about fixing your life.

I highly recommend checking him out. I hope his ideas help you as they have helped me. 

I know it can be difficult reaching out to get help. But I promise you it really is worth it. Just take it one small step at a time. All the best.

Are you that cruel enough to let someone else shoulder your funeral expenses?

life sucks rn, but it's only a temporary phase. i know it is kinda hypocritical of me to say this since i'm struggling with the thoughts of death every day, but it all boils down to how you perceive life when obstacles hit you hard. i have lost 2 friends to suicide from depression and had my savings wiped clean by my parents, and my heart is broken as hell because of these, but i still hang on in life because there's no point dwelling about it since what's done has already been done and the only salvation is thinking about what i can do right now to change my future. Study harder for As to get into local uni? Probably, as long as i don't go crazy by the end of this A levels journey.

I'm not asking you to go back to school right now since it's not feasible for your current income bracket, but as long as you save diligently, you should be able to see your money grow. The growth may not be fast since you need to pay bills and all, but it will grow. While the money is growing however, take some time to have a date with yourself. Not like those expensive lunch dinner dates, but like take a walk around the country when you have the time to. Walk around nature parks like Botanic Gardens, challenge yourself to walk the entire park from the cluny court entrance to the bukit timah exit, or hike the bukit timah hill or walk the macritchie trail. You don't need expensive hiking equipment to do these things, just walk around with an open mind and appreciate how you are here, at this moment, breathing air and feeling the wind and sunlight against your skin. You can even explore your neighbourhood, walk from one street to another.

Living is painful, yes, but it is ultimately up to you to make the best of it. ~~If you do end up committing suicide, chances are you are just gonna end up as another hidden figure in the government's archives~~

Life just brought me in a bad place and then brought me out. But the MO said i should take some credit for dealing with my depression which was rubbish since I did nothing.

The sun rises and sets, the heart pumps blood, life births itself and dies, all out of our control. Life gives you a bad hand, it may or may not turn and give you a better one. Just take it one day at a time and live how you best see fit."
e1noghr,PhotosynthesisingRat,"Which doctor did you see? You might want to try another one.

Did you tell them you tried to kill yourself? They tend to fast track you and take you very seriously once you bring up death.

e1otuo4,outc5st,"Hey brother, keep talking to us. There are people who care here. Let us know *how* we can actually help you.

I recommend reading Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl. It's alrund 70 pages. It's a holocaust survivor's account of his experience helpless in a concentration camp, and how he searched for meaning in such circumstances. If you feel like there is nothing that could go more wrong than it currently is, take it from this author. 

Heart goes out to you this morning. Please keep talking to us. "
e1p0390,Shadow_Vamp,"Hey don't be so hard on yourself, I too have been very cynical while depressed, still am though, but I laugh at it. Give it some time, it could be the depression talking, giving you a flawed perspective of things when you are flooded with emotions.

If you are not happy with the persona you are playing, then don't play the role. I gave up playing my persona when I found myself as a character in the wrong book. I too have taken life too seriously, in the end who cares. Just step aside and let chaos do its thing, if stupidity caused them to die, then let them die. Depression is caused by imbalance, no point standing in the face of stupidity to stop the world from autocorrecting itself. "
e1phqz9,Remiskawaii,"Just a lurker here, just wanted to let you know that I read all your posts and wish you the best.

I look forward to your next update, hopefully there will be one. Do what you need to survive and be happy. It is not my right to say but at this point I believe you should prioritise your happiness over any fillial or religous concerns."
e22184h,Silver1legs,"Hey, man. I read your entire story and it sounds almost like mine! Except I had to deal with an abusive gambling addict mother, not a father. Like you, I am also a 31 year old single this year and merely a diploma holder.

Just a little context and share my recovery story: I was just like you. I had an abusive mother who would both emotionally and physically abuse me since childhood and stole all my wages to fund her gambling habit. She was declared a bankrupt and I had to pay her debts despite only earning $1500/mo. My father passed away from lung cancer after, I was also on the verge of killing myself from the painful grief and stress.

One day, with only $1000 in my name, I made the toughest choice to break away from my mother. When she was out, I packed my things, ran away from home and never looked back again. My life did get better but it was still tough as my rent was $800 a month and I was eating so little. I was only earning $1300-$1700/mo as a customer service officer.

I was also wasting my life away at games because I was so depressed, anxiety-ridden. I felt like I ruined my entire twenties. I also suffered from chronic nightmares of my mother hurting me over and over.

One day, I was self-reflecting, feeling I was very abnormal from others. I wanted to be happy. So I made the decision to go to Geylang Polyclinic and got a referral at Geylang Psychiatric Wellness clinic. I was ready to pay a huge sum of money to ""fix myself"" mentally but to my surprise, my bills were only $50. My psychiatrist assessed that I had PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and it has been affecting my whole life. After going through therapy and put on prozac, I felt functioning and decided it was time to improve my life and find solutions to my rut.

My first decision for improvement and to recover was to stop thinking myself as inferior. So I quit my job and took up a better paying tech support job to sustain my rent.

Next, I applied to Singapore University of Social Sciences for a degree so I can get better paud and upgrade. Their part-time degrees do not require you to attend all classes and it's not compulsory to attend lectures. You can still learn everything completely online on their Canvas learning portal if you're too busy to go to classes. The school is also government subsidized, you can get grants and loans for it.

Next, to fulfill myself emotionally, I started volunteering at charity organizations, helping elderly, children with disabilities, other PTSD patients like me and befriending ex-convicts. It felt like a rewarding experience because I got to know many friends and also great social workers who vouched for me in my scholarship application.

I know you hate social workers and had bad experiences with them. I am truly sorry to hear that. Times have changed, however. I have met many wonderful social workers who have given me advice and assistance I needed. Like you, I am single, 31 years old, not earning much, also hope to buy my own HDB flat at 35. I still lament over my financial situation and my rent and debts but I felt like I took great steps in improving my situation by taking a degree in SUSS, getting therapy and doing volunteering work. I hope to make a career switch to social work myself as I saw a calling to help others like you and me.

I know it's easier to say than to do when people tell you not to give up. I'm not gonna give you any advice because I don't know your experiences too well to offer concrete solutions but I empathize with you greatly, hence I'm here to share my story as a living proof that healing and recovering from such a terrible rut is possible. It's going to be tough and shitty but I know you can be capable of it. From I have read from your story, you seem like a strong, intelligent person.

Please don't think of killing yourself. You are a valued person and I hope you find the strength to survive this."

e1nb02e,antsepea,No you actually get even better deals if you shop at the wet market or certain neighborhood supermarkets like ang mo / u save etc.. 
e1nfomd,NoObOii,"Whether or not life is worth it really depends, many people seem to only think so because **their** lives are worth it, but for some others, honestly, there is sometimes just so much to think about, I’d rather just be at rest, or at peace forever. Being alive makes me feel like I can never be at peace forever, that I always have to have something to worry about and personally I’ve grown quite sick and tired of the idea of having to keep up myself either.



Life is a struggle and sometimes, people just have to accept that life isn’t for all of us. Life only made me wish I was never born, I never asked to be brought into this tiring, cruel world."
e1nc0ip,GramTooNoob,"I don't quality for medifund and I learnt this the hard way after being told by a social worker to apply for it then getting rejected since I don't fall into the needy group. Maybe life is worth living, but not in Singapore.

I hate social workers. And I also believe that successful people make alot of great quotes because they can. Many of those quotes however are meaningless or less applicable. In fact, the people that make those quotes don't even follow them. They just want to sound smart when interviewed. 

"
e1nkk9b,GramTooNoob,"I am aware that its a crime, but like I said. I plan to execute a 100&#37; die plan if I do believe the time is right. Failure is not an option. Funeral wise, there are money left aside for it. For me, mine is very simple. No need ritual, just burn the body and well do whatever they want with the ash. It can become fertilizer for all I care.

I'm sorry to hear what happened to you. But if it means anything, you should aim to study hard for paper certifications if you want to work in Singapore. Experience means shit, all employer know is... no paper ah? No short listed, no interviews. If you do get them, they devalue you so bad to the point like they are actually doing you a favor, so you should take that low pay as gratitude. I seen too much, that's why I dishearten."
e1p491w,GramTooNoob,"Ya, you are absolutely right. I dunno why I get into arguments or conflict that's not even mine to begin with. Taking too seriously and always ended up trying to make a point."
e23tv1b,GramTooNoob,"Thanks for taking the time to share your story and motivate a stranger on the net. You know, I too want to step out of this mess, that's why I still make effort... but it always ends up in a loop. Somehow I keep spiraling downwards. 

I really feel like my future is ruined because of my past and I dunno what's the point in going forward anymore. Yesterday, I was so lonely that I almost jumped off cause it was too suffocating. There was no one I could reach out to and I wished I had actually build up more relationships during my youth, even if I had limited money to hang out with them. "
e1nlha1,GramTooNoob,"Are those OTC? I'm specifically looking for something that I can just buy off the shelves or as and when I did. Its a matter of convenience actually, when I suddenly feel like its a good time, I can just grab it in a hurry. I'm always very excited when I want to get something done, and I do them very fast. But if I can't do them fast, then I lose all interest."
e1ne6sp,GramTooNoob,"No money, how go overseas? This aren't the age where I can just build a raft and row myself out to sea. Financially, I am in ruins and prospects for making money are dim so I can't afford to live. Make sense?

My best wish atm is to be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can finally for once tell people I'm really dying and for them to let me die in peace. Yes, I want to have cancer."
e1nb6ui,zeroX14,Not true on the neighbourhood smaller supermarkets. I've been to a few to compare prices and they are actually 10 to even 20% pricier than Sheng Shiong down the road. Redmart has this policy of offering the lowest price for their groceries actually. 
e1nia13,doctorwhybother98,"It sounds like your thinking is clouded by a lot of cynicism. I'd caution you to be aware of those thoughts and recognize them for the distortions that they are. 

Ultimately it's really your responsibility to get the help you need and to improve your condition and situation. Not all people are bad. Not all professionals suck. They can offer tools to help you, but brushing it aside doesn't do any good. As I said, talking things through with a trusted therapist will help you sort out your thoughts. 

Else, you can continue blaming everyone and everything else for your misfortunes and achieve nothing and continue to spiral downwards. It's really your choice at the end of the day. 

You don't have to suffer like this. You really don't. "

Yes, I'm cynical. Very cynical, that's why I don't have friends around me anymore. I cut things down to the core and nobody really likes it when it point it out that way. Should I change? I dunno. I do appreciate advise though, not trying to be an ass. "
e1nf74n,GramTooNoob,"As I told the doctor, when I wanted to kill myself that day, it was extremely emotional. But the decision to suicide is an educated option that I adopted. I am actually at peace now, for once in so many years. I spent quite a good time researching on how to be a better person and how a person should present himself. Unfortunately I don't know how to fit into society because it turns out that I did well mostly right, and I would have to compromise alot, be the one to put in effort because the other party doesn't care. It just feels very worthless, and why I have no one around me anymore. 

Accomplishment wise, I get those of them in games but real life is a far cry and thus why I can't get myself to update my resume. There's just nothing to write under achievements. My previous company wouldn't give me a referral letter too because well.. I don't know and I don't want to ask. Anyway, when all you have in the world is yourself and only yourself to live for... alot of things doesn't matter anymore. I don't even shave or cut my hair anymore since none of those matters. I don't have to spent unnecessary effort for potential ""sleepover"". I would say, i am actually very at peace now. Now that I don't have longing for anything. It doesn't matter to me whether the anime has a new episode or whether it has another season. I'm ready to go anytime, I just have some legal obligations pending out."

e1nkw0c,GramTooNoob,"Don't need to feel sad or useless. Its just unfortunate that the power of one is only so much, we can't really help anyone else in all honesty. Unless well, we are in a much better position to offer aid. Thus we live in such an environment where nobody helps another because we are all busy stepping on each other, in order to reach the top. Upon reaching the top, then we say... ok hmm.. its time to give back to society and everyone think of him as a great person, a role model, a success story of hard work. Well... people can believe whatever they want, I suppose.

Anyway, I think i went a little off point. What I really wanted to say is, well.. even if your neighbor suddenly die at night, you also won't know. So no need to worry about a stranger whom you don't even know where and what IP address. Like people say... just chilling."

dwf293r,KanseiDorifto,"One advice I can give is to distract yourself. Like whenever you start to think of sex or masturbation, try to think of something else. Force your thoughts if you need to. Think of something that will calm you down.

All i can tell you is to go out more and do stuff that keeps your mind off jerking off. Exercise more so u will be too tired to fap.

Lay off the porn. Its a luxury not a necessity. "
dwh0pvo,khambs,"If you feel that it's interfering with your day to day life and the lack of it is causing you anxiety and depression you might have a mental health issue. 

You could get assistance in many ways if you are dealing with mental health problems which may be the root of your addiction. Some resources are 

1. CHAT 
It's an organization that provides mental health help to anyone between 16 to 30. It's completely confidential so you don't have to worry about the stigma. You can either make an appointment for yourself or chat with them on their website. 
https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/get-help/make-chat-referral/ 
They should be able to direct you in the right direction.


2. You can talk to your GP. They're bound by confidentiality so you again don't have to worry about anyone finding out. They'll be able to refer you to perhaps the Institue of Mental Health or other qualified professionals. 

3. Engage with people having the same problem. It's great that you joined nofap but perhaps you could engage with a few people individually. So maybe you can find comfort in the fact that they're also struggling with the same thing. Try talking about it with someone you trust which I know is hard for you.But in the end I'm sure if you talk to someone from your family they might be a bit put off but they'll definitely support you in the end. 

You're already doing a great job, the first step is recognition and you're already aware of your problem. You're on the path to recovery and best of luck!"
dwi83tk,highdiver_2000,"Nofap is a freaking joke.

Change your media from videos/movies to GIFs and pictures.  Some control required.

As with other comments.  Exercise, a lot more.  Don't be stupid and destroy your body.  Try different things.  Eg running, swimming, push ups/sit ups etc.

Reduce / Change the timing you view your media.  Turning off the phone helps.
"
dwetc60,Steaky92,"Not sure if it will help but

1. fast intermittently. (if u are capable, follow the islam method. NOT trying to convert u, just as a basis) 
2. Reduce red meat consumption

The first 3 days will be hell but By day 5, your sex drive will reduce. 

Everything done in moderation is good, which includes masturbation. And if at night, reduce screen time during masturbation if you could not commit to fasting. "
dweu9x7,,"some people have higher sex drive than others, it's completely normal. on the contrary, it is more of a problem if one does NOT feel horny. On the naughty side there are hookup apps around that can help with your urge to meet equally horny people. Of course finding an equally horny partner/lover is better..."

dwetvfr,myr0n,Sex and masturbation is different addiction unless you can explain to me how to get STD with masturbation.

Before considering seeking a psychiatrist which might be a big financial burden, there are a few free avenues that you can seek help from. Here are some helplines that you can contact:

Samaritians of Singapore (SOS)
1800 221 4444 (24 hrs)

Community Helath Assessment Team (CHAT)
6493 6500, 6493 6501 (12nn-9pm, Tues-Sun, closed on PH)

IMH Emergency Help Line
6389 2222 (24 hrs)

Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH)
1800 283 7019 (Mon-Fri, 9am-6pm)

Teen Challenge
6346 9333 (Mon-Fri: 9am-5pm, Sat: 9am-1pm)

Touch Line

If you want to seek help in person, you can consider a counsellor in your college (depending on which college you are from), or you can approach the [Family Service Centre](http://app.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/familyservice/default.aspx) as they provide counselling services. 

I highly recommend for one to seek help if needed. You are not alone.

cn18e2z,mrq1989,"As someone who works in the fields of mental health i would have the following advice...

If you feel you are strong enough to get through this without the help of medication i would definitely recommend you do so. Anti depressants have their place and value but are often seen as a first response to mental illness as opposed to a last resort which i feel they should be. Going onto anti-depressants so early in life can result in this being your coping strategy as opposed to learning and developing your own. Periods of depression can often be overcome with therapy. 
Identifying triggers of poor mental health (stress/change/loss) and identifying patterns/loops of negative thoughts can often be the best way to move away from a cycle of depression and through gained understanding allow us to break such cycles and move beyond them. Reflection upon the positives you have in life and using your personal strengths to overcome personal difficulties is, in my opinion, the best help and therapy to break a period of depression. Regaining ownership over your own health can be the most empowering experience in someone's life and can work towards rebuilding confidence, self esteem and a trust in your self that can often be lost during times of depression. 
Remember the things you love to do. The things that once gave meaning and value to your day and try to reconnect with them. Make graded small steps towards connecting again with your routine and your identity. It may be something relatively small like leaving the house to go for something nice to eat. Calling a trusted friend. Visiting the cinema or if this is too difficult inviting a friend to watch a film at your home. The more you withdraw from your routine the greater your feelings of loss/hopelessness will increase. 
I would also say to you that one of the greatest strengths we have in this life are our connections with other people and the ones we love. Our support networks are what keep us all connected and strong. Hiding even from those you trust is a difficult path to go down. It is tiring and damaging to your sense of self, identity and self confidence. Self-esteem can never grow when hiding parts of yourself as that can only result in shame and guilt. Powerful and damaging emotions. 

Through all of this remember who you are, embrace the good and beauty around you, do not recognise shame or fear because we are all human and all face hardships in our lives. Do not be quick to assume you are alone because trust me, you are not.

Good luck on your journey. "

This is an oversimplification. The biggest thing about depression is that you don't see any point at all in life, and there's no point in anything.

cn17drc,llosa,"When I was depressed in SG, I found that finding specialists who were able to cure me was not cheap at all.

Expect to pay 200/h and up for a psychiatrist (they can prescribe medication). My psychologist (counselor) changed 180/h. Of course, some people charge less, and since you are in college, your school probably has a counselor for free. Medication is relatively cheap, 1 to 2 months of Prozac cost me less than $50. "
cn1h91d,,[deleted]
cn17zen,mwolfee,"Hi op. If you're worried about costs,  I can shed some light on IMH. I was warded there for about two weeks, and it cost me... I think around 600-800? Can't remember the figure. That Sum was entirely paid by Medisave. C class ward. For follow up appointments,  each one costs me between 40-60$ depending on medication etc. If you are having trouble paying,  the staff there are more than willing to help. You can speak to a medical social worker to see what your options are. 

I ask that you seek help from a professional. I won't say it will help,  however there's always the change that it might. That alone makes the cost worth it. 

Feel free to ask me more if you have any questions. "
cn1t9ao,,There are psychiatric departments in public hospitals that are not imh. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and counsellor at ktph for years now and i can honestly say theyre better than the private ones I saw. They're not desperate to ply me with medicine to earn their commission and they actually let me choose what medicine is best for me and how much I want. And if you see them about once in two weeks its really not that expensive. About $50 a visit for counselling and $30 to see the psychiatrist. You can get counselling at your uni so you'd only be paying to see the psychiatrist and for medicine. Probably about once a month is enough to adjust medication and get excuse letters and stuff. 
cn18oh1,abetterguy,"Take up meditation. Free, and the best decision you will ever make."
cn1cc8z,okdhd,"I'm currently seeking treatment for depression at IMH for cost reasons, and have seen two private psychologists/psychiatrists previously for other conditions. To be frank it isn't all bad, there are good doctors and not-as-good doctors just like in private practice. 

Subsidised rate at IMH is $30+ a session before medication, and at 1 appointment per month, that's really not bad at all. There is a waiting time for an appointment though, which you can shortcut immediately by going to the emergency room and paying $100 to get seen right away (which is ok considering that's how much you would pay by going to a private doc anyway) and subsequently your appointments would be in 1-month intervals like usual.

PM me if you have any more questions, happy to share my strangely specific experience in the matter."

cn24nxe,myepicdemise,"I'm currently suffering from depression and social/generalized anxiety disorder (I was born with anxiety disorders), and I see a private psychiatrist. I just paid $187 for a 15 min consultation and a 3-week's worth of anti-depressants this afternoon. Since you have other financial burdens, going my route isn't a viable solution for you. But psychiatrists at public hospitals aren't much cheaper to consult either (I paid $88 for a 30 min consultation with no medications before I went to private clinics). The important question to ask yourself is whether you feel medications are necessary. I advise you to visit your school counselor and evaluate whether it's effective enough for you. Going the medication route would be a last resort for you because it is very costly.

You can pm me if you have anything else to ask."

cn22tby,myepicdemise,There's a stigma with IMH because of how people in Singapore are generally uneducated regarding mental illness. So they end up making fun of IMH like it's some insane asylum depicted in movies.
cn1gcej,teamaniac,"I beg to differ. When someone says they're depressed, it's always better to err the side of caution and help them as much as we can. 

Yes, the word ""depressed"" has been overused by many people, but if we do not take the words of the people who said that they are depressed seriously, and if they *truly* are depressed, this might just be their last call for help before doing something to hurt themselves or to give up on life entirely. 

Most people who have friends or family members that have attempted/committed suicide were shocked because they did not pay attention/take note of the minor details like this as a cry for help. Some depressed people show no outward signs of depression at all. 

In summary, I would rather have my time wasted by a prankster than ignore anyone who says they're depressed and has asked for help. Better be safe than sorry. Every life is precious. 

Also, obligatory /r/suicidewatch in case OP needs help but can't find anyone to talk to. "
cn1pbyo,severedfragile,"Yeah, you sound like you've got a cult that needs members.
"
cn18r9e,teamaniac,"Do note that on top of govt subsidies by seeing doctors at IMH/ as a subsidized patient, you can also opt to use medisave to pay for your bills as well if you're diagnosed with major depression. 

You just need your psychiatrist to sign a form for you, stating your diagnosis. So when you register to see a doctor, you will have to tell the receptionist that you're going to use medisave to pay so they can make the necessary deductions. 

So the payment will go like this: you have to pay the first $30 and 15% of the total bill. So if the bill to see a doctor costs $100, you'll have to pay $30 + $15 = $45. This is subjected to a cap of $400/year and you can use the medisave of up to 10 different family members. Things that includes inside this payment would be things like consultations, medications, laboratory investigations etc. 

You can look over [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/policies-and-issues/elderly_healthcare.html) for more information. 

Please don't let money be something that stops you from seeking help. If you need help, you can pm me or any other people who are willing to help and has posted in this thread. "
cn17x2w,llosa,Yup
cn186l1,mwolfee,"I stayed in a C-class ward with about 35-40 patients,  so experiences may vary even within the same class. 

Anyway,  my stay in IMH was mind-numbingly boring. There were no activities for patients beyond the TV,  some old movies and daily newspapers. Patients were mostly left to their own, until one of them needs attention. I can't say that it's good,  although neither was my experience bad. 

Finding a good doctor takes a while,  though. I'm planning to ask for a change of doctors if my next appointment doesn't go well. "

cn23j78,dashrandom,Thanks for the feedback. What should I have done better/instead? 
cn29ep3,,[deleted]
cn2azu5,dashrandom,"Oh c'mon. The only other topic I ever commented on that was even vaguely related was the one on NS and mental illness. And I don't think I made a wrong statement when I said that you'll have problems finding a job in Singapore when you did not serve NS on the basis of mental illness. You should know better than anyone that there's a huge stigma on people with mental illnesses in the workplace if you've brought up your depression in an interview or during the HR/insurance coverage talk before.

I do admit I may have phrased the original comment in this thread badly. From what I'm reading though, you're suggesting that since I can't be empathetic according to your definition, I should just do nothing at all. That's not very constructive criticism, but ok.

Lastly, I do know about the physiological causes of depression. I took a course on abnormal psych a couple of years back. I also suffer very serious insomnia, caused by guess what? A failure to regulate my own neurotransmitter production, so while I don't understand what it's like to be depressed, I understand pretty well you cannot ""will"" yourself to sleep like you can ""will"" yourself out of depression.

To be perfectly and brutally honest, your comment felt extremely condescending and presumptuous, perhaps because you feel that you can empathize ""more"" with OP than me. Yes, you probably can. Am I suggesting OP try harder to get of depression? No. But you should know as well as I that depression cannot be self diagnosed. It takes a trained professional. Your claim is that I should err on the side of safety, no, I think that's a terrible mindset to take because of our culture of medicalization of illnesses. Imagine if every psychologist erred on the side of safety, we'd have a nation of children diagnosed with ADHD like America. 

OP has been pointed out to a bunch of resources (if you read the comments) that he knows about and refuses to use, which makes me think that there's the possibility that he's **not** depressed (not ruling out the possibility that he is), which is why I offered to talk and find out a little more about his situation.

I don't know if you're biased against me after reading that NS post but I really think you shouldn't make assumptions about others and their motivations from a single post (which I still maintain is true, if you deny the stigmatization of mental illness in Singapore as a reality, something is very wrong with you)."
cnhd8h4,,"You don't have to laugh if you don't find it amusing or nod your head if you don't agree. Having no reaction is always an option. Yes, not fitting in is a possibility, but your words here make it seem like this hypocrisy will damage you more than being ostracized will.

If you had reacted angrily each time, would you have made anyone reconsider their opinion and become more accepting of homosexuality? I doubt it. More than likely you would have just created really awkward situations.

If you want to make a genuine impact, don't create drama through actions such as walking away in a huff or starting a campaign that is doomed to failure. Dramatic actions make you feel like you're contributing, when mostly you are making yourself look emotionally unstable and socially inept.

If your colleagues have particular views you disagree with, but are otherwise decent people, you can try making a genuine impact one conversation at a time. If they're toxic through and through, it may be best to simply keep your distance. 
"
cnhr18z,Hope83,"Sorry, but the impression I get is that when you were young, you were hot-headed and lashing out against those people whom you don't agree with simply because you could. Now that you are in the adult world, there's a lot more at stake and you can't just say what you want without paying a price along with it. And as a result of that, you are choking on your own powerlessness. 

As NXMT puts it, we have to pick our battles in life. I have plenty of people I want to speak out against esp. in workplaces, but even if I did say out my point, would it really change them? If it ain't, then what's the point? 

Is there no middle ground? Isn't it possible for you to perhaps pull one or two of those that you respect aside and are closer to and just voice out in a VERY tactful manner that you feel uncomfortable about the way they joke and disrespect homosexuals and that it hurts to hear what they say as you have people whom you care abt that are in the LGBT community?

Must it always be a stand up for what is right and try to hammer everyone else down because you think they are wrong?

Seek a balanced middle ground to get your point across. And even then you may not succeed in convincing them. If so, make a choice, live with it or quit.
"
cnhe1bp,,"Pick your battles. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions no matter how diseased or shallow minded you think it is. For instance, I am personally not favourable towards religion but if I had to make a counter argument everytime my colleague vaguely mentions something about putting his faith in God to get him through a particularly tough period at the office, I'm going to find myself without friends very soon.

Everybody would love to tout that ""making changes starts from something small"". In this case, your small is standing up against homophobia in a small office environment but chances are you'll be wasting your breath as for your colleagues, it may have been nothing more than a passing thought which they happened to regurgitate out loud during a seemingly casual group chat. The topic probably just happened to pick up speed because several like minded people were there.

In college, you may have been free to speak your mind but I strongly suggest dissing that notion. I'm not suggesting your bend over but ask yourself is it really worth your time and effort to get worked up over something that is unlikely to change AND where the people themselves don't even matter!. Maybe MAYBE one or two will have a change of heart. The rest as you say, will simply dismiss you as a wet blanket and without allies, your corporate climb is as good as dead.

Don't get too caught up with your own personal stake. You might as well stay off the internet because for everything you hold dear, someone out there is ready to take a shit all over it be it out of true hate or purely to fuck your day up for fun.

Pick your battles."

cnhqag1,phdee,"Hmm. I've been that person. You know, that person that says, ""hey, that's not cool, don't say that."" People deal with it two ways - they either take it back or they go all ""y so srs?"". Where I am people usually take it back, and then launch into a discussion about why it's offensive. I use that opportunity to explain. I try to remain calm, because somehow being emotional about things reads as irrational, and people think irrationality is uncredible or something stupid like that, but I digress.

When people go ""y so srs"" or ""just a joke, come on"" or other ""politically correct"" bullshit, I get mad. I try not to get mad, but I try to get the point across that your (their) words mean more than ""just a joke"". I'm all for collegiality and shit, but people can have a good time without putting other people down. The words, terms, and jokes they use so easily (eg. ""that's so gay"", ""retard"", etc) are an indication of how they really feel about such things. It might help to say something like, ""is this how you really feel about gay people?""

I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I have to admit I try to make people feel stupid for making derogatory remarks, and I do this for a lot of things, like homosexual remarks, sexist remarks, racist shit, and yes, even saying things like ""retard"". Why? Because if they knew better, they wouldn't make such ignorant remarks. So I try to come at it from an educational standpoint. Which is part of the act of making them realize they're being ignorant.

Will I become a social pariah in certain situations for standing up for my beliefs? Sure. But I don't *need* these ignorant jerks in my life. I know work is hard, and stewing in silence is difficult, but I personally feel that if I've done the right thing, and have at least attempted to change the way they talk about things, then at least my conscience is clear. Then I go home and rant to my family and friends about it. YMMV. 

Do whatever feels right for you. Either way you're losing something. If you don't say anything you're losing your mind and you're grappling with your conscience and integrity. If you say something you only risk losing the companionship of people you're potentially better off without anyway."

2) You were disrespected and did nothing about it.  
3) These people will exist till the day you die, age might help them mask it and changing jobs for a ""Safe environment"" won't do you any damn good.

I say you'd not give a fuck and stomp them.  Seems barbaric at first but allow me explain for you see, I am Asian too.  Except, I spent the first 10 years of my life in Asia before going to a land where 5-6 year old kids already begun bumping into each other via Football, Hockey, Basketball and Soccer.  It's not violent, but with exposures comes understanding to confrontations, sometimes it's alright to communicate through the fist and sometimes that's how friends are made ->>>> That's seen in asian movies.

Asians, and Singaporean unfortunately grown up playing individual sports, it's what popular and what wins these countries medals.  Because of space history culture or what not we don't devote resources towards contact sports.  And like any education system it demonstrates itself into the adulthood.  It shows the way Asian loves to communicate - by being subtle, on point, avoid direct confrontation yet loves to talk behind the back.  The environment trained us for mind games and we are pretty good at it, but the process demonized confrontations and in your case, just simply standing up for yourself.

I say this because I understand the type of catch22 you are dealing with.  Sorry dude, you need to make a stand and it's going to be risky either way.  But confrontation is just as right and wrong to being passive if you can get rid of that chain of stigma preventing you from doing so - it's just an action and not an identity.  Gandi is just as right as he is wrong, he will always be part of history not for just for his stern stance on principles but a reminder to his descendants about the applicability itself - ""Timing"". 

Get buff, be strong, next time someone annoys you tell them to politely stfu or you'll give him a good physical reminder. You might lose some friends along the way, but it's either that or you can deal with these asshole for the next 80 years in your life. "
cnki3q3,skilletstove,Actually a certain colleague does fixate on the topic and brings it up quite a bit... I did wonder.. 
cnhq75f,mchspc,"In my experience, HR is a department to protect a company from its employees, not a place where you can go \**teacher, teacher xyz said something bad*\* - especially in Singapore. "

cni5eqy,scalarp,"That's why it mustn't be framed as a whiney ""teacher he say f-word"" kind of complaint. HR should give a shit because there's the potential for disgruntled employees to escalate it even further, which obviously isn't in the best interest of the company. Of course HR departments operate differently from company to company even in Singapore so I might be totally off base here, but this definitely isn't the kind of situation that OP should take upon himself to handle. "
cnkhz0z,skilletstove,"My main HR contact in the company has contributed to an array of insensitive comments I've heard since I joined. I honestly don't know whether it would be a good move to point out that I have a list of objections against things he/she said.. awkward since they should be the most sensitive/politically correct no? But you are right, I have realized it shouldn't be something I should handle on my own.. it won't change much."
c8aaod1,mburg777,"TL:DR (From Mr Singh himself!)

1. Slow down immigration and focus on resolving all issue related to the past population boom.

2. We can live with a slightly slower growth (not zero or slow growth) and hence moderate dependence on foreigners.

3. Use the Dubai model to complement our local workforce with foreign workforce, but don’t grant them PRs – ie a transient workforce.

4. Abandon the 6.9m figure by 2030, this will be another rapid growth which we cannot handle.

5. Solve Singaporeans problems first and also don’t give PRs same privileges as citizens.

c8axqg7,posture_foundation,"Though I agree to his concern on the population issue, some of his solution is just too naive:- PR boys to serve NS. This is a national security matters. PR (foreign citizen) should not even be part of it. In my opinion, the solution is to have PR as temporary status. 10-15 yrs. After that he/she must choose either become a citizen, or an employment pass holder.Same thing with PR boys. By age 21, he needs to say the oath, and then have obligation to serve NS, or permanently discharge from the PR status. (of course he can still apply for student/employment pass)- reduce PR privileges.. Agreed, but it has to be done fairly. Reduced privileges means reduced responsibilities as well. I am talking about CPF contribution.-gahmen to enforce type of education for PR's children. Really? This is waay too naive for a member of parliament. - his story about new citizen from china who can buy luxurious property, and why his fellow singaporeans can't.This is just plain emotional statement with no basis; next time sir, please compare tycoon to tycoon, factory worker to factory worker. I am sure there are many singaporean tycoons who own billion dollar property in china, indon, Philippine.- his comparison between his generation who can buy cars n houses at the early age, and current generation who have it tough. Again he is being naive here. 80ies-early 90ies is an end/peak of a golden era of economy. Everybody have it easy during that time. In US, Europe, even developed countries like india n indonesia, all college graduates can afford standard housing and a car/motorbike, but to be fair, how many college graduate are there in the 80ies? now world changes, Now competition is fierce, each person you met in the mrt is a college graduate. So yes, this current generation singaporeans (actually the whole world) have is tougher than before. The question is what to do about it? His solution is (what I understand anyway) To overprotect them. Protect them from outside competition. I don't think its a good idea. singapore has only 1 resource: human resource. I say, focus in better education ( which actually the current gahmen is quite good at, we have lots of new international quality schools like SUTD, SOTA.. Though can be better, especially on the primary/secondary levels  Edit:One last thing, be careful in comparing sg with finland, canada, or even dubai.. They have tremendous amount of natural resources. And their policies are derivatives from that fact   "
c8acayd,,"Some of this makes sense. Some doesn't. Some just makes me go ""are you paying any attention?""

> The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round, reduce fees for Singaporeans not just increase for PRs.

This policy already exists. It's for PR children and not for first generation PRs. So not sure what you mean by ""a couple of days before reciting the pledge"".


Second generation male PRs have to serve NS. Although, it can be circumvented by forfeiting the PR and leaving Singapore forever. This should be penalized in some way. For example, cutting a pretty big portion of parents' CPF if PR is forfeited.

c8arjhf,,"I've kinda given up arguing in this subreddit, because most people here seem to have completely forgotten that many of their grandparents/great-grandparents were probably immigrants, themselves. I know mine were."
c8bic9q,YouKiddin,"Because I'm someone who wants to experience life in Singapore for purely personal reasons. Mainly travel (because of the obvious geographical advantages), pop-culture affinity (mainly K-pop concerts) and appreciation for food (because, I love food). I can relate and fit in to Singaporean society very easily because of my interests and have already made Singaporean friends while still being in India because of it.

What irritates me is seeing people (not just from India) ready and willing - quite desperately - to get into Singapore by any means necessary. That includes working for below par salaries and even taking up *any* education course as a gateway to hopefully stay longer once they graduate. Meaning, they're not even studying for the sake of their own well-being. Then they try really hard to apply for PR status as soon as they are eligible and begin the process of bringing their entire family over. Because they already decided they have no intention of going back to their country of origin.

In the past one-and-half years that I've been researching on Singapore and looking for a job, I have come across many such instances in various forums and discussions that cement the above facts and it irritates that I may very well be clubbed under the same. Even though I only have the intention of staying and working in Singapore for a year or two until I finish [traveling across Asia](http://mithunonthe.net/category/travel/). Even on my [second visit to Singapore](http://mithunonthe.net/category/travel/singapore/) I was fairly bored. I'm not blaming any one particular race for such behaviour as I have seen enough examples of people from Indonesia to America, all vying for the same. I *can* understand the frustrations of the locals and a some of it *is* justified. But I would also like to state, the hidden racism (which seems to have always existed) *has* dampened my interest in Singapore in the past few months."
c8as7ra,KeythKatz,"Jesus Lee then, the son of Great Lee."
c8av8j2,mispronounced,"I think this ""my grandparent/great-grandparents were immigrants"" argument is moot. When they migrated to Singapore for work, Singapore was still undeveloped. Singapore got to where it is based on the hard work of these people who made up the first generation of Singaporeans. The resentment against immigrants nowadays arises from the fact that immigrants are seen as reaping the benefits of the first generation's work. Just because your grandparents/great-grandparents were probably immigrants does not make that a good point of argument.

And I'm sorry but I still do not get what you mean."
c8bif5d,tldrtldrtldr,"You are coming across as sly. You blame others for trying to be PR and staying in Singapore and you yourself want to live here for one-two years. Truth is since you are not able to find an entry you are looking for all kind of excuses. Who's to say once you do get a job, you won't try to get a PR yourself? 

There are many people who don't want to get Singapore PR, even though they are eligible for it since many years now. It's just a silly stereotype you are making yourself believe for failure to not able to secure an entry here. 

tldr: Your intention and chances of being in Singapore has nothing to do with other people getting or not getting PR."
c8bio4d,YouKiddin,"> Who's to say once you do get a job, you won't try to get a PR yourself?

True, but as of now I'm dead certain about my plans. Once I'm done travelling Asia, I will move on to Europe and so forth. In the summer of 2014, I will be in Brazil for the World Cup and I'm already saving up for that. If you must know my future plans.

But I stand by whatever else I said. The first mistake I made is assuming salaries in Singapore match the high cost of living there. When I assumed SG$5000-7000 p.m. salaries would be fairly common for someone with 8 years of MNC work experience (i.e, me) it was disappointing to know most relevant jobs openings I came across were in the $2500-$4000 mark, especially those that weren't strictly for Singaporean or PRs only. 

Companies in Singapore can get away with it because even in that range, they have enough candidates from all around the world - desperate to get in - who are ready and willing to apply. I know for sure my chances would improve if I was willing to work for less, but I choose not to, because I'm not desperate to be in Singapore. Singapore is the number one choice; but by default, when it comes to working in SE Asia, most good jobs *are* in Singapore. Practically ever major company who operates in SE Asia is headquartered in Singapore leaving only satellite/regional offices in neighbouring markets. But I would be just as happy if I got a good job in Bangkok, KL, Hong Kong or Manila. Singapore is not the only nation I care about."
c8biqnl,tldrtldrtldr,"I am glad to learn about your plans. And I hope you do get to execute and experience them. But I would like to underscore that people being PR or not is not affecting them any which ways. That's what prompted this discussion right?

About the job. Singapore is a dynamic work environment. With even locals being replaced quite fiercely. Companies are primarily here for tax purposes. Government services are great and likely best in the world at a very low tax rate. But it's not a protectionist government. And corporations moving here, are not here because Singapore is a great place to live. It is, but that's like icing on the cake.

Not sure how you are approaching job hunting. Let me suggest to you that it be more pragmatic to get a job in one of the satellite offices and push your boss for move to Singapore after a while.

And yes, do not settle for anything less than 6k. That's bare minimum to enjoy all the spoils around you."

dde82a1,suckmynondick,"It happened in secondary school. Someone from another class committed suicide. If I remember it correctly, it was a Friday when they announced over the intercom that ""name"" had passed away in an unfortunate incident and that the counsellors office was open to anyone who needed it. 

It was jarring to say the least. Everyone was talking about it after class, they said it was an ""incident"", but we all know what really happened. There was a solemn atmosphere in the whole school. I didn't know him personally but he was supposed to be in my Chinese class; I know because I see his name covered by correction tape on the class list. I think about him whenever I look at it. 

One of my classmates was the guys best friend, he was devastated. He tried to keep himself together when they announced it but from what I heard, he broke down with a bunch of other friends. 

Like I said, I didn't know him personally but I almost cried when I heard the announcement. It's just sad. We were 16, we had our whole lives ahead of us, to hear that one of our peers didn't get to live out his life was just... sad. 


If there's anyone thinking about suicide, seriously talk to someone about it. If possible, seek professional help. "

ddeat9i,notfated,"I used to feel like it is the fault of the people around them if someone commits suicide, until my friend did so. 

The thing that it was a bit worse cos he didn't die. He was in coma for a week but succumbing to his injuries. So we were hoping that he wouldn't die. 

I was shocked for most of it. Numb mostly now. I never had closure cos his parents had a private cremation. 

I have played back the past countless of times wondering if i could have anything different. With him, it was a lot of deep rooted issues. I would have never been able to be at that level of trust to help him.

I won't say that i have changed significantly. But I do check in with my friends more often.

Called SOS before too when I really felt like dying, it felt like the operator was just reading off a script and it wasn't sincere at all. I even requested to see a therapist from them and they said they will get back to me but they never did... I mean I don't blame SOS, they are prolly run by volunteers and do not have much resources to accommodate me. 

But come on, this made me realise Singapore has such a piss poor system for depressed people. Sure, one can pay for a therapist, but what if the person cannot afford it? Like a 16 year old? This just makes me angry and sad, depression is so stigmatized and not understood well by the masses, that there is no resources available for those whom really need help. Truly tragic."

ct80mqh,throwaway7B463C0,"I will admit that i am depressed, not to any extend to being suicidal (although i wouldn't make it a point to announce it anyway, since pricks like you people insist its better for me to be kept in an institution than to be relieved from my misery)

From the comments i've seen, you guys are the reason why nobody seeks help for mental health. Any attempt to breach the subject would be met with either condescending ""get over it"" remarks, as if one has a flu one day and gets well after a day in bed, or the ""if you say that again, i will slap you"" from parents, or even the alarmist action of calling the police. This is why i found difficulty seeking help, the stigma of owning up to mental disorder.

 >This would teach him to not joke around.

Depression isn't a joke, neither does it come to one as an enlightened idea. You speak as if its a plan a 5 year old formuated to get a parent's attention.

 >maybe he'll snap out of it

Maybe my grandparents can snap out of cancer and tuberculosis too.

>Got to keep the workhorses going. Society invests 10+ years of education, shelter and proctection in you, and it'll be a cold day in hell before it lets you off without returns.

>I know someone who's relative had a failed attempted suicide attempt. It's subjective. You'll get trialed for it and if the lawyer can prove that you were not mentally sound prior to the attempt, all good, you go into IMH, counselling, help etc. If not, you spend some time in jail or pay a fine. If you even have a lawyer.

Maybe it is true that Singapore really owns my body, i am not allowed to leave my misery, even when it is a voluntary act, and any attempt caught by the government will send me into a place where they decide my fate.

""...But at least you can fucking die and leave North Korea.”

ct7o3ai,nerradchoo,"Good job bro.  
Attempted suicide is an offence in Singapore, so you have to excuse the police and IMH if they don't give him milk and cookies.  
The fact that he was ""mistreated"" was probably because he was agitated at that point of time and would probably abscond. Under the mental health act, the police and IMH staff reserve the right to detain anybody for 72 hours against their will especially if they pose a danger to themselves and the public.  
I don't feel you should reproach yourself for what you did. One day, when he is out of depression and back to a normal life, he will thank you for saving him that fine day."

After accuse been arrested, he will be interview by IO to take statement. Then he will be assess by in house doctor for physical and mental assessment but mostly physical part before referral to IMH. At IMH, he will be assess by psychiatrist and the doctor will determine how severe his suicidal behaviour. If it's not so severe, he would've walk out of lock up before 48 hours probably with a bail.

That seems to be a common sentiment for people who try the square of being against homosexuality but still come across as loving Christians. At least I've heard it a couple of times.

e6h2qyy,InfinityHearts,"I think that if people take issues with the repeal of 377A because of religious reasons, then it is a form of religious arrogance. I mean isn't it clear that Singapore is secular and must remain secular for religious equality? What if there is a minority religion saying that not embracing your homosexuality is a sin? Is it right to imply that your religion is superior to the minority religion/people without religion by wanting your religious teachings to influence the state's law? We have came a long way to teach our children about the morality of racial and gender equality, but when it comes to religions, this whole ordeal shows that we are not there yet.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry if I sounded like I generalised certain religions' practitioners to not respect other religious or non-religious beliefs. I do know that majority of the people respect other religions, and that they also have other arguments in support of keeping 377A.

I'm saying that arguments that only have its premise under religious contexts should be obviously invalid. But this doesn't seem to be as obvious as arguments having to do with race or gender, as though like people are less sensitive to religious equality than to racial and gender equality."
e6gwxn0,testinf1233,The church and mosque should stay out of state matters and keep their mouth shut. Repelling of 377a will not “destroy” family. Gay will still be gay with or without 377A. 
e6hfrbq,oCmon,"Thank you for this. It strikes incredibly close to home, because I also recently just came out to my homophobic Christian father and stepmother (my mother and stepfather are Buddhists/free thinkers and have known since I was 18). I grew up with my father constantly voicing his opinion on homosexuality whenever it came up on television, so I knew I would never be able to come out until I had financial independence as well since he was paying for me through university.

When I came out, I cried after I said the very first sentence. And the tears could not stop because it was so cathartic to finally be telling them who I really was as a person after hiding it from them for 15 years (I've known I was homosexual since mid-primary school). And the only things he could say was ""why?"" and ""if I had known early, I could have done something"". And I lost it. I laughed and asked what he could have done to me. Beat me? Send me for ""correction therapy""? And I said the exact same things you thought. If I could choose, as if I would choose this? As if I would choose to have to look at my father and see the disappointment in his face and know that I will never be able to bring my girlfriend home like others can.

But things ended up reasonably well too. I didn't get slapped like I expected, I didn't get disowned straight away. He said ""I'm not happy with your choices, but you are still my daughter"", and in that moment I thanked God because that was the best possible outcome I hoped and prayed every day of my life for. But many of my friends are not in the same position and it kills me every time they speak of it because I was in their shoes just a month ago. Even if same-sex marriage never gets legalised here, removing this archaic law will at least offer some sort of protection for people who come out and aren't so lucky, be it government backed shelters or financial aid or anything at all.

e6h6x1l,avocado_milkshake,"I won't mince my words: if you support 377A, fuck you, you're a cunt.

I respect your opinion if you are unable to accept homosexuality, or if you think it's morally wrong, or indecent, or whatever. You can't change the way you feel about certain things. That's fine!

But what you can change is how you act on it. If you want to deprive other individuals of their right to act on their feelings, because of your feelings, you're a selfish, bigoted cunt and there's no argument about that. 377A is indisputably an archaic remnant of discriminatory nature. The fact that it targets not an act, but a demographic, already speaks to it's discriminatory nature. 

If you're worried about the spread of HIV, then why aren't you advocating for a complete ban of anal sex? Why just anal sex by men? Don't women have anuses too?"
e6h9y8y,deadbydurden,"OP, this was so eloquently written. The debate surrounding 377A frustrates me so much. To me, there is no rational justification from a 'religious' perspective to maintain 377A. At the end of the day, two fundamental notions remain:  
1. Being gay is not a choice   
2. There is a separation of church and state  

Even if religious people refuse to admit (1), (2) remains independently true. And what it means is that insofar as being gay doesn't harm you personally or harm the community, and gay people deserve equal human rights, 377A should be repealed. There is no cogent, non-homophobic response against this; all appeals are fear-mongering, or completely irrational, or slippery slopes. 
  

But unfortunately, the ongoing debate irl doesn't resemble this black and white argument, and people are gullible and it's difficult to change people's minds. The 'religious' side of things has made this completely about them and has weaponised this debate in a political sense.  No longer is the real concern whether gay people deserve basic human rights. It's about whether religious beliefs are ""under threat"" - when they are not. The self-victimisation is so disgusting. "
e6hebxv,zyytii,I have had contributed extensively in this forum to support the repeal and I wish I can do more. To our gay friends in Singapore I want to say that there are many who don't share such views and accept whatever nature gives. I am not a Christian and I happily anchored my life to Nature. Nature never rejects you as its children; Nature never says that you are wrong in your sexual orientation. Be happy coz others can't reprimand on this ground.

e6hfzp4,Puppywanton,"I am deeply sorry for what you’ve had to go through. 

It angers me that homosexuals are viewed as promiscuous corrupters out to “convert” other people when more often than not conversion therapy is exactly what gay people are subjected to in some churches in order to “save their souls”.

It angers me that people think they can “pray the gay away”. 

It angers me that without any real understanding or empathy or compassion that people think that this is something that they need to fix when it doesn’t even affect them, and is none of their business.

Most of all, it angers me that even as most Singaporeans claim not to be homophobic, that they only mete out tolerance on a “as long as they don’t try anything on me” basis. Say what? Why would a group of people stereotyped as having fantastic taste and style be attracted to them? Honestly, the conceit astounds me. 

I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with all this confusion and guilt and I am angry that in this day and age that we still criminalise sex acts between consenting adults of age merely because they are “different”.

You are not alone, I wholeheartedly support the repeal of 377A and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive those who labour under the illusion that their religious “righteous” indignation is justified. Hate, discrimination and marginalization is never justified.

e6j84xz,sweetsubway,"Thank you so much for sharing. I myself had a very similar experience, and like you, I will always clearly remember my mother's tone of voice when she suddenly turned to me one day and told me, ""If it turns out you like girls, I will send you to the psychiatrist to take medication to cure it."" 

This was maybe around a decade ago now, but I will never forget those words. Same with my dad, who was watching TV when he suddenly told me that ""gay people are unnatural"", but he followed that by telling me he thinks that ""killing them is a bit too much"" in such an indifferent tone you would think he was talking about animals on a farm. 

At that time I had been struggling with my sexuality for years and her words really cut me very deeply like a knife. I'm 23 and comfortable with my bisexuality now, but it took me 15 years of struggling to properly come out to myself. Those words still come and haunt me sometimes, but I try to tell myself that my own validation is all that matters. 


The thing is that none of them are very religious (my mum is kinda a believer but she's not very hardcore) and their homo/bi/transphobia really stems from what they see as ""societal values"" and ""asian values"" they see as guidance for their moral compasses. You are right, 377A is not ""just a symbol"", but is symbolically violent and discriminatory. It's a tool to justify hurtful, terrible views.  

I do LGBTQ+ related research as a graduate student, and my parents are usually quite embarrassed to talk to others about what I do. That doesn't bother me as much, though. Still not out to my parents, my family (except for my sister), and a lot of close friends. I have a lot of Christian/Catholic friends, so I'm just terrified of coming out to anyone in case I have no friends left haha. Last time I tried to test the waters with two of my friends and they told me they were afraid I was going to ""fall in love with them"" and they told me to ""stay away from them"". Of course we are no longer friends haha. 

If anyone else here is struggling with their bisexuality, or just want to make a bi friend, I'm happy to speak! I recently just started a community for Bi+ people (we are all very nice, I promise!), so message me if you want to know more :) Happy to talk! ^^"
e6hlnvm,Pope-Fluffy-Bunny,"Religion is not good. Religion is historically a force that has killed hundreds of thousands, of not millions. 

They explicitly tell their adherents to kill those who are different; at any point on the globe at any moment there is a religion teaching that someone is evil and worthy of death. 

For those who argue otherwise, given the amount of wealth that religion and religious folks have as a group, why is there so much hunger and suffering in the world? Making excuses for religion is making excuses for a homicidal institution. Do we really need to remind you of the witch hunts, the murder of women by religion, the gay bashing fueled by religious teachings?

Standing with religion is standing with the very institutions that killed our ancestors and families.

Everyone else is born without sin except gay people. They have to start this life as walking sinful abomination, lesser human.

It stems from ignorance and an unwillingless to accept that which is diferent.

e6h3m31,posdnous-trugoy,"Let me play devil's advocate.  Since you were educated in the US, you should have seen first hand how the religious political infrastructure in the US has been extremely destructive to secular society there.  This wasn't always the case, in fact, you can point to a ""watershed"" moment that galvanised the largely non-political religious churches of the evangelical south to organise to become a political force.

The Roe vs Wade Supreme court decision basically became a rallying cry that made the churches enter the political arena, now almost 50 years later, they are one of the most powerful forces in US politics.

As always, the people hurt by this are not the the ones with means and finances, they can stay relatively insulated in their liberal bubbles, the ones hurt are the lower classes without money.

So my question is are you prepared for the backlash if Repeal of 377A galvanises the local churches into a similar political movement?"

In all seriousness, I'm sorry for all that you and every young child out there who has to suffer through this. 


I've been having an argument in a youtube comment section where I find they keep pulling out *""if you ask for help, we can help you""* or *I won't argue with you if all you are going to do is insult me""* which annoyed me to no end because I purposely word my responses in as polite a tone as possible because I know precisely what they'll say. 


I find it's like arguing with flat-earthers or anti-vaxxers because they never listen. They'll pull out their ad hominem responses and attack you directly.

I've had the great fortune to grow up in a great family, which is very unfortunately homophobic. I don't know my orientation myself, because I simply haven't adventured enough to find out yet. But, if I were attracted to the same gender, I'm going to take it in stride. Unfortunately, I don't know if my family and community will, which honestly terrifies me. 

Knowing that there's a law that criminalizes you for who you are is horrible, regardless of whether it's a ""just a symbol"" or not."

e6h8qzy,chickennopasta,"playing the devil's advocate, I do think your parents still have a hard time accepting you and the LGBT community, since they have been brought up around an environment which shuns and do not understand them. I imagine this is the case for many of those who are opposing the repeal of 377A, but to also blame the government for not stepping up might not be productive. I do not think the govt wants to open up a can of worms by forcing a policy (and essentially a viewpoint) that a large community does not share.    
Nevertheless, I do think LGBTs are increasingly being understood and accepted in Singapore. However, while I do support the repeal of 377A and personally have a few gay friends myself, I think the action of repeal is quite extreme. Inciting change has always been a slow process, by changing the perspective of those on the fence and bringing them to your side. Extreme actions (viewed by the other side of the fence) are in fact more likely to push people away from your agenda.    
e.g. imagine peoples personality and values as a logic tree, with some fundamental belief as a starting point; beliefs and values are built upon the fundamentals before it, and so on. The entire tree would represent a persons personality, values and beliefs. For a religious man brought up in a religious family, God and anti-LGBT beliefs would sit quite deeply in this tree. Breaking down and changing this belief would mean to change the rest of the beliefs he has built upon this particular value; needless to say it won't be easy. Alternatively, an atheist with exposure to Western media would have anti-LGBT values more towards the edge of the tree away from the starting point, and would be easier to sway this belief.    
Do I believe 377A will be repealed? Of course. When will it be repealed? Not right now, but in the future definitely."

e6i52rl,C_Raz_Y,"Well said. 

The most fucked up thing is the amount of hate and fear-mongering coming from 377A supporters. The issue would be simpler if they kept to themselves instead of asserting their views onto others. Its ok if someone hates or gets offended by something, but they are not entitled to assert their opinion onto others. 

My view on this is cynical, but part of it is to be expected in our conservative society where the amount of narrow-minded idiots is rather high.

I'm very thick-skinned when it comes to this, but what I feel is important for us as individuals is for us to be ourselves regardless of what society and those around us say or think, even if it means sacrificing  some things. Individuality is one of the most important things we have, and should not be discarded or changed, especially in a society that wants us to change for it.

But I want to say, as a christian, I see you as pretty similar to me: you are facing battles just as much as I am (and as any human being). Your writing is eloquent and you clearly have much depth of thought. I admire that.

If I knew you in real life I can assure you I would treat you the same as I treat anyone, in the way the Jesus loves everyone too. You’ve been to church. You know that Jesus doesn’t hate on people. So don’t let the rude comments of other christians let you think that all christians condemn and hate the LGBTQ community. They are just confused -  “this is something that goes against my belief, I don’t know what to do so I’ll just repel it with all my might,” all the while forgetting that they’re dealing with actual human lives. It’s hurtful and not representative of the christian faith.

Having said that, I don’t hate you, and like I said if I knew you in real life you would be as much a friend to me as anyone else. However, I can’t support your purpose. Contrary to popular belief, there is a difference between love and acceptance. But I still fully respect you and I’m not here to fight. I’m here to change your mindset that you’re hated or seen as a sinner when “everyone else is not born with sin” (i read that comment above). You’re loved.

Oh my this is a really long reply. Like I said I’m not here to fight, I’m not here to judge (since only God can do that right) and I can only imagine what you have been going through so far. I hope this changes your mindset (and of anyone reading this) to know that Christians are not haters nor are we narrow minded. Thanks for reading. :)"

Right now, there is evidently a lot of resistance against 377A. A large number of groups such as churches have formed that have became echo chambers that cannot be reasoned with. No amount of pleading will get through to them, no amounts of factual information will change their minds. Because facts don't matter, feelings do. Yet these groups hold influence over massive numbers of loyal followers(voters), as well as the government due to SG's religion stance.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure nothing will change from this episode. Any push from either side will result in resistance in the opposite side. Both sides seem to have taken the moral high ground on opposite ends and the differences are almost irreconcilable. People are shouting as loud as they possibly can on every platform possible and your post is one such rallying tool after all. Your post has managed to generate fierce shouting and name calling, hardly better than those on the other side. Every Singaporean involved in this discussion has already picked a side, and your post will certainly change zero minds.

&#x200B;

It is inevitable that 377A will eventually be repealed, that is a fact. However the time just isn't right. Unless a massive shake up happens such as PAP leaving, the status quo will be maintained. I hate to say this, but every passionate post will generate equally passionate resistance, both sides will alienate each other more and more. As the repeal of 377A is a decision which should be made as one nation, this is counterproductive."

e6h9pv7,crassina,"I’ve spoken out on reddit about 377A before (rip karma). 

A lot have said if you aren’t against homosexuality, you should be for repealing 377A. 

I’d like to point out that there’s no reason why these two shouldnt be mutually exclusive. 

I have gay friends and I respect their sexuality. I do not, however, support the repealing 377A. There’s no reason for it not to remain status quo especially since the authorities are not actively enforcing it. 

If there are reports that religious zealots are knocking down motel doors to catch homosexuals in the act and calling the authorities, thus forcing them to enforce it, then yes, repeal it. 

All I have read is that repealing 377A will be symbolic, and yes, it damn well will be. Supporters of the LGBT community will gather and celebrate the “legality” of their community. This, to me, presents a problem, what’s to stop those pro-377A people from thinking that they are rubbing this “loss” in their faces. 

Already, there r retards who think that pinkdot, despite getting the required permits, should be illegal. 


I respect your sexuality. But the status quo should remain if there isn’t any legally compelling reason to remove it. "
e6hh91o,CaseyMcKinky,"I feel OP has a slight misunderstanding in the role 377A plays in regards to the Singapore LGBT issue. 377A is very much a symbolic law that is hardly enforced, and the important thing we should consider is the stance of the judiciary depending on whether or not the law is repealed as it affects future legislative attitudes towards LGBT individuals. That being said, OP highlights a cultural misunderstanding and unfamiliarity Singaporeans have towards LGBT issues and thus results in a fear of the unknown. Regardless of whether 377A existed in the first place or what happens to 377A, Singaporeans will continue to have doubts about LGBT issues.

Fortunately, the attempt to repeal 377A has definitely shed more light on the issue, and with time, I am sure Singaporeans will come round and accept people of the LGBT community."
e6iqzax,josephlee222,"Singapore is a country with multiple religion, races. Therefore the government cannot just decide to NOT repel the act because of just one religion that hates on it.

e6hddb8,Singaporeanboxer,"I disagree. They still play a huge part in Singapore as many Singaporeans do have religious beliefs and these religious organisations represent them in a similar way that Pink Dot represents the LGBT community at times.

When such a large group makes up the majority of Singaporeans, you have to listen to their opinion so as to not disrespect religious individuals and respect them in the same way that LGBT people also want to be respected by having their beliefs and ideas heard which is why Pink Dot is so important. It’s a platform for the LGBT community to have their opinions heard from the majority of Singaporeans.

The difference is the argument that religious individuals are still the majority in contrast to LGBT supporters and in a democratic society, we have to listen to the majority opinion."
e6gyplx,Shieotenkayaday,"But the next step of that is fighting for gay marriage. Lgbt has always made that clear. 377a is only the first obstacle so it's also in the religious group's interest to keep it there.

Rather it is Christian’s who cannot sit back when they see the moral standards of man slipping below the benchmark. I’d like to also point out that Christians aren’t the only ones who are against the repealing the law. There are also Muslims and Catholics who are against the repeal. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against the LGBT community, and I accept the fact that it’s a struggle to be in this community when there is a law against the G in LGBT. But you have to understand that 377a does not only represent a law, it represents societal standards. If 377a gets repelled, it won’t be just “two people in a bedroom” but rather it would be open to public. The worst case scenario is the moral Armageddon religious people believe in, but even in the best case scenario we would have to sacrifice societal moral standards.

We are to submit our desires to God, be it for more money, more possessions or for the desire of the same sex.

Yeah, you don't have a choice over your own desires. Similarly, everyone is greedy for material possessions to some extent. Same concept - we are all sinners and bear our cross. The bible unequivocally states that homosexuality is not to be celebrated, and that will remain my stance.

We are all stakeholders in this nation and have a right to our views heard - yours as much as mine. What prevails should then be the final conclusion on whether s377a is repealed or not."
e6haco0,Plasu,"I’m sorry but it is you who needs to stop regressing society. Moral standards should apply universally regardless of societal norms or religious beliefs. Repealing 377a is akin to legalising theft or arson. 

Furthermore the government has already shown its sincerity to the LGBT community by agreeing not to persecute offenders with the full scale of the law. Also 377a only applies to the G in LGBT. So why must your community fight for the entire ruler when the society in Singapore have already given you the inch? "
e6hpcjf,buttoxide,I agree with you especially on the last point. *377A is a fundie Christian's wet dream*. Can you imagine the Trump Administration with Jeff Sessions with the power of 377A? I do not believe that such a law will forever not be enforced.

e6h2acu,DoorkMatter,"I read an interesting take on that once: if you think homosexuality is a choice it might be because you're bisexual yourself and actively choose not to act on your same sex attractions. If you base your opinion on your own experience then it *is* a choice.

Doesn't make it okay to use that rhetoric though. "
e6h57dv,hollowstriker,"I'll actually be very interested in a study that conclusively determined homosextuallity is not a choice. I have not come across such studies.

It hurts the argument for pro-homosexuality by citing pseudo-science and claiming it's science, or (even worse) misunderstanding studies. After all, the an argument on the grounds of science must innately rely on its rigor of the scientific method and peer review of the scientific community."

e6h4yhy,Millicent_the_wizard,basically AWARE saga 2.0
e97ulhn,buttoxide,Thanks for sharing. How did you find this post it you don't frequent r/singapore? 
e6hbcca,buttoxide,"Hey. No worries. It's obviously not a statement that's awful at first glance. But at least to me, it is an extension of the idea of homosexuality is a choice or an action.

Take for example stealing. Stealing is considered wrong. But even if you caught your son stealing from the grocery store, the idea the church preaches is that you can look past what he did can still love him as a son.

The problem here is that if you believe that if you're gay, for example, you're told that liking other boys is wrong. You end up kissing a boy one Saturday night, and feeling guilty about it at church the next day. 

But the church tells you that it's OK. You made a mistake, but we still love you! We can look past your misgivings, just as long as you try harder to resist your homosexual urges next time! 

You look around you and everyone gives you the impression that it's possible. You don't see any gay person in the church, do you? So you try again. 

You try dating a girl. It fails because you see no attraction in her. You lock eyes for too long with a cute guy in the changing room. You feel guilty about it. You end up making out again on Saturday night and end up sitting back at the pew in church the next day. Now you feel horrible inside. It was just one week and you failed at controlling your homosexual urges. 

Have you ever had those days where you feel like you're screwing up and nothing goes right? If you're gay and you believe that you shouldn't act on it, so to speak, life after puberty feels like a series of mistakes over and over. And it's *your* fault! *You* weren't disciplined! *You* made the wrong choices over and over and over! In the church, you see only straight, happy families around you. There are no gays, they are unnatural! They don't exist!

You start to wonder to yourself again... *""Am I not good enough? Am I not disciplined enough?""*

*""... what the fuck is wrong with me?""*

Which is why it does sound innocent at first, but like I said, the phrase together with the words ""choice"" are a thousand little cuts to your self esteem. When you can't separate your sexuality and your existence and are told that homosexuality is a sin, a defect, you start feeling like *you're the defect*. Brood on it too long, and you start feeling resentment and disgust for yourself. You don't think you *deserve to exist.* I know because I've been there and done that.

At least that's my take on it. And from the many responses I've been getting on here and Facebook, I am definitely not alone."

The existence of 377a is a symptom to the main problem in Singapore: the voices of religious institutions are heavily favored vs others. It seems to me the Archbishops message and NCCS was a veiled threat to the ruling party: keep 377A or lose our confidence / vote. Which is a sad and worrying trend if we are to keep a secular society. 

However, one of the reasons I wrote this and shared this publicly was to see if I can appeal to some of them, at least. To see if they can realize that such words can be damaging. A small addition to our island so that one day the zeitgeist might be a lot friendlier to be ready for repeal. "

e6ld6gk,anakinmcfly,"Lesbians actually have the lowest rate of HIV transmission compared to gay men and straight people, so this isn't a homosexuality issue per se. It's about who has the virus and who that person is having sex with, and for how long (because there's a period of higher contagion). In the context of casual sex, if a single gay man has HIV and spreads it to another gay man, that man would then spread it further to other gay men and thus have the virus propagate within the community; vs if a straight man has HIV and spreads it to a straight woman, who may spread it to another man but not to another woman - which halves the potential infections and ensures it can't spread as fast.

Africa is one place where this model doesn't apply. Over there, the highest rates of HIV are actually among straight married women. It's common and socially accepted there for men to have both wives and girlfriends whom they're actively having sex with - so one guy might pass HIV to his wife, who passes it to her boyfriend the next day, who passes it to his other girlfriend, and so on, which leads to extremely rapid spreading of the virus, including to people who have only had sex with one other person in their life."
e6hcsen,AmazingGraces,"Would you have said the same thing about slavery? What if you were a slave yourself?

e6hqg7n,buttoxide,"Yes, I understand that polarization is a tough problem. While it is difficult to engage each other, I wrote this in the effort to show my story that there is real damage done everyday. The first small step would be to stop saying hurtful comments that would save many heartaches in the near future.

I agree that changing someone's mind does seem like an insurmountable task. However, I would disagree that zero people will change their minds. My experience, I acknowledge, is small. But small though it is, it will remain on the minds of some when they bring up their children. And if just one hesitates about telling their kids that homosexuals will burn in hell for eternity, it might save someone years of misery down the road.

However, it just happened to be a bad fit for the current 377A discussion because most religions are intolerant of LGBT issues. The views of religious groups will always be tolerated, yet their views on LGBT are ""fine"" because technically LGBT issues are not a race and culture issue. It's one sided you see, churches can hold protests against ""LGBT lifestyle"" and be totally fine, yet protesting a religion will get you arrested.

Do you think this law which prevents gay marriage is discriminatory and hence should be removed?"
e6hbr09,paper_boxes,">  legally compelling reason 

* Discrimination against males only

Noticed that female-on-female consensual activities are not criminalised? There you have it.

* 377A *is* bad law

The government cannot reasonably claim that it does not actively enforce/turns a blind eye on 377A. A private individual can make a police report on a male-male couple based on 377A, and the police will have to investigate or this would undermine the rule of law (in this situation 377A is still law). 

Sure, the police and AGC may decide to issue a stern warning instead, but that in itself is still a finding that the offence is made out and proven beyond reasonable doubt, just that they have decided not to prosecute in court.

* Provenance of 377A

377A descends from the colonial era when laws were being written for the Straits Settlements, and derives from both the English legal system and the Indian Penal Code (through the original s377 of the Indian PC).

Since times have changed and Singapore is now supposedly a secular, independent state, laws have been repealed when they were considered irrelevant to the contemporary context - anal and oral sex were once criminalised in the original s377 as sexual activities ""against the order of nature"" but were taken off the books circa 2007.

A law shouldn’t be here for “symbolic” purposes. A law should be here to be enforced and keep citizens in line. Hence, there is ZERO need for 377A to be here if it not enforced. 


Why put a gun on the open table if you’re not planning to use it? So, get rid of it and keep it away. 


The law being here has enforced the thinking of the close-minded into believing that they do not need to learn more about LGBTQ+ Culture because the state is on their side. That is why they’re so adamant about not repealing it, because if 377A is repealed it means they are wrong and they refuse to accept that.

e6j7mqh,helaesdea,"

I've been a Christian all my life, but support the repeal of 377a. (Of course, being democratic, the public should first be consulted and their views considered)

I believe that we all are influenced by a combination of 'nature' and 'nurture'. But the fact that one can be born with homosexual tendencies/preferences does not mean the act cannot be separated from the person. Just like how some people are more predisposed to violence or exploitative behaviours, or it would be unfair and incorrect to not separate their tendencies from the individual. This separation is widely subscribed to, not least by social scientists on many issues besides homosexuality.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of misrepresentation and generalisation of religion in this sub (the original post, while just and reasonable, also contains these), which spawn anti-religious comments, many of which are simple untrue. Many of us don't believe that homosexuality in itself will send people to hell. Many of us are not blind to science and human rights. And most of us certainly don't see 377a as 'flag to rally supporters for religious rights'. Yes there is vocal Christian opposition to the repeal, but the vocal should not be mistaken for the majority nor their attitudes and views seen as representative of religion or it's people.

I really hope the 377 issue does not become a religion vs 'others' divide. It's convenient and it feels good, but it does no one any favours because all it leads to is misinformation and unfounded hatred. If 'real damage to society' is what you truly wish to avoid, it's best to thread this carefully.

e6h58um,the-uncle,"I agree, but that's exactly where the separation of church and state should come into play, i.e., the state has to acknowledge that it's not a choice.

But these people will never live the satisfaction that some of us will get when we find a partner that we love and are attracted to.

While homosexuality is an issue of allowing 2 consenting people to be in love while still having the age of consent apply to them. Currently 377A makes it illegal for homosexual adults to have sex in Singapore.


So, no. While preparing to defend homosexuals, the same arguments DO NOT apply to paedophiles and the inability of *some* people to see that is pretty sad. 


The issue isn’t *just* about choice. It’s about equality. It’s about deciding if a person’s action will harm someone else.

e6hglxv,hurl_not_here49,"I understand your view and agree that sometimes politicians are morally obligated to create change despite the inconvenience. But the situation in Singapore regarding 377A is definitely not an apocalyptic one.

&#x200B;

First things first, I need to mention that the implications of 377A fall into 2 categories: legal, and social. While I very much agree that 377A does carry some horrible social implications (like the ones that OP along with many others have mentioned) and thus am on board with its repeal, the legal implications, on the other hand, are practically non-existent. When have you ever heard 377A being enforced? In the one case ever where two gay men were caught having sex in public, 377A wasn't even used. The charge was instead substituted with 294A which simply criminalises obscene acts in public. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying that just because it's not enforced means we don't need to repeal it. I'm just saying that Cryxtalix's view is more understandable given that people in Singapore aren't actually being prosecuted for it, and thus I can understand why he/she feels that the repeal of 377A isn't a pressing issue.

e6hdlcb,Cryxtalix,"Yes I would. Salvery in the world wasn't immediately abolished globally once countries start banning it. There are places with more resistance and some with less, and it's a gradual change.

I know you think 377A is injustice and you are probably right. But the religion groups aren't arguing based on justice, they are arguing based on their personal beliefs and feelings about the matter. Your factual assessment of the lack of justice will never get through to them. They are talking on a different wavelength.

I mentioned that I think removal of 377A is inevitable. Just not quite yet because SG is one of the places with significant resistance and change needs to happen gradually. You can't rush it and expect it to work, unless something really big happens, such as a switch in the ruling party.

These people need to drop their religious biases, admit they were wrong and warmup to accepting new ideas. It's a gradual process that is very personal and cannot be rushed. Demonising and insulting them will only strengthen the ""us vs them"" mentality, and is counterproductive to change and acceptance. Which is why I think giving them time is better than flooding the internet with think pieces and forcing the anti-LGBT into their safe little echo chambers, where they are lost forever and only appear to vote against you."

I don’t think I am arguing against homosexuality. I have been focussed on my point that 377A should not be repealed.

It is not ‘potential negative outcome’, I am unsure of your age but I have lived through the age where homosexuality was seen to be taboo and coming out was seen to be groundbreaking. I still remember when Ellen DeGeneres came out and all the media was just going on 24/7 about how “brave” she was bla bla bla.

Fast forward today, we see that the transgender group are also in on the action and society is slowly accepting of such behaviours. Caitlin Jenner is now hailed as “brave” as Ellen was more than 20 years ago. 

In Australia, we even see these groups making their move on children in the form of the Safe School project. Outwardly it was hailed as a project to ‘protect LGBT children’ but dig deeper, it’s an indoctrination campaign

I can understand pedophilia exist and that pedophiles were born that way. I empathize with people who have this paraphilia and wish that society will be more understanding of this condition so that people who have it will be more willing to seek treatment.

However I cannot accept a pedophile as acceptance of that individual's condition means that I also have to accept that he/she may enter into a carnal relationship with a minor which is something society abhors."

More gays seem to be born in the spring and summer (mothers were pregnant during flu season). Unfortunately, a lot of these studies have been on males since society tends to value them more than females.

But I managed to find a paper he co-authored with others but that paper was published in a journal called The Linacre Quarterly-and it was on the topic of rebutting recommendations made by American Psychological Association to stop sexual orientation change therapies.

Second, I took the effort to read through his paper. One thing: the research about identical twins and their genetics make-up was not conducted by him at all. He made several claims, sometimes inference, by reading through other people's works on identical twins (that do not have homosexuality as its main thesis) and claiming that it supports his thesis. Many of his claims and proposals in the paper are not backed up by empirical data. 

Third, statements such as the following are made in the paper: ""Perhaps your son or daughter is gay. Probably its origin had nothing to do with you. But you may be blaming yourself, or others may be blaming you when its roots really lie in major misperceptions of events, and some resolution may be possible."" It is very clear that this paper (book) is not targeted at academics, and has nowhere the rigorosity an academic research paper is supposed to have.

that said, the theory that u/raspberrih mentioned about is called Fraternity Birth Order (FBO), the biological effect that explaining why probability of a boy growing up to be gay increases for each older brother born to the same mother. [This is a review article published in PNAS that briefly summarizes the biochemical events behind the theorized effect.](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/234) the original article is included in the references. ELI5: when the mother is pregnant with a son, the son will have male-specific proteins released into the bloodstream that is exchanged between the blood of both mother and son. as this is foreign to the mother's body system, the immune system develops a reaction to it to neutralize the foreign protein. with each son the mother bears, her immunity against this grows stronger. what this means for the child: later born sons have suppressed effect of this male-specific protein. this is theorized to affect the brain development of subsequent sons. Although this study provides scientific evidence linking homosexuality and developmental biology, this only forms a small portion of the entire puzzle. But it does show that there evidence (along with many other scientific studies) that homosexuality has a component that is nature instead of all nurture. "

e6hjqhj,lifeisworthliving69,"Hmm interesting but if yes means yes and no means no, who is to say what REALLY consent is? Other humans that are no way in terms of morality better than you? So pedophilia is not ok because it impedes on one’s nature of decision making. homosexuality is not ok because it goes against the nature of the majority of the human species. Then again, who is to say what really the nature of things are? Other humans who are also in no way better than you in terms of morality? I feel laws are set as a guideline on an agreed standard of morality we expect to see in each other, if we decide to go Against the order of morality, what more are we than the lesser species who behave based on carnal desires? Feelings are feelings and they shouldn’t be a deciding factor on morals and values. I don’t like seeing gay things, I understand love and how it makes you feel which is the only reason why I don’t bash my gay friends, but I’ve never ever been ok with it in a supporting sense. I’m all for love and happiness, but I feel that there’s more to homosexuality than just ‘ I just like other boys’ in comparison, if we are given true freedom in who we decide to sleep with, then the laws should work the same way for everything else as well. There should be no exception just because it involves homosexuality.  Because pedophilia is also another type of love we don’t understand. But if we don’t have laws, then we are as good as savages.

e6i8qn5,Singaporeanboxer,"I can understand your point but it also strays far away from the argument of 377A.

You state that there is a tangible negative effect. This doesn’t make sense because even if you repeal it, those that are against the LGBT community are not suddenly going to be more accepting of it as even from OP’s perspective, it is clear that those that are against LGBT lifestyle aren’t doing so because the government tells them to but because of their own backgrounds and understandings.

When you mention civil liberties, we can assume things like marriage and not being prosecuted but as many have already said, it is not a law that is enforced and there is no evidence that suggests that once 377A is repealed, new laws will be added to give similar rights to LGBT folk that heterosexual people have(which is why people say 377A is symbolic in the first place).

But ignoring that, what is your definition of civil liberties? What exactly are they being denied under the constitution? Again, things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution. If you mention things like protection from hate speech then you should also understand that by definition they are technically still given that liberty. ( You can read what rights are protected and what exceptions there are here https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=pr9-,pr10-,pr11-,pr12-,pr13-,pr14-,pr15-).

The government has no responsibility to protect the LGBT community from religious individuals as they have every right to speak out as it is part of their doctrine not to accept homosexual acts just as how pro-LGBT individuals are free to criticise their opinions.

The idea that we should protect all minorities while good-natured is impossible. We see this in EU countries that either have strong opposition towards letting in refugees, have opposition groups against pro-refugee policies or have policies to better help transition of refugees due to the difference in cultures. Similarly, the LGBT lifestyle runs against the lifestyle of the majority and thus, it is fair to have opposition against it.

Now, you might say that there is nothing wrong with the LGBT lifestyle but that isn’t the point. Tl;dr Under the constitution, they have the same rights and as mentioned before, 377A isn’t enforced. 

"
e6h15l8,Shieotenkayaday,"I mentioned in my reply 'the religuous's idea of a family'. Which is between man and woman. So if you change the definition of marriage to be between man and man that would be against their idea of a 'marriage'.

They are possibly against the idea of churches being forced to allow gay marriages to occur in their churches. Their preists and bishops may be forced to solemnise the gay marriages.

I'm not going to answer your question about whether gay marriages lack love because: it's tough to define love. And even if we can define love we don't have a large sample for gay marriages. Then there's the data collection of love for straight marriages etc. But from what I'm hearing, gay people tend to have many partners"

e6hem8z,Plasu,"What do you mean by nope? I mentioned that 377a only affects the G in LGBT which is fundamentally correct. 

And I wouldn't want to point fingers about the origin of the moral benchmark, but according to the Divine Command Theory, it was actually decided upon by religion. If we unravel the long story, there are two ways we can go about this. One is to determine the history of the laws in Singapore and the other is to question how is morality determined. Historically Singapore's laws were inspired by UK's laws after colonisation and UK's laws were inspired by the morals written in the bible. And if we take the philosophical route on how morality is determined in society, we have Moral Subjectivism, Cultural Relativism, Ethical Egoism and Divine Command Theory. But if you read up on the different theories of morality, most of them are individualised and would fail to be represented as a majority, except for the Divine Command Theory. Which is in-line with the concept that the law was founded on moral principles determined by religion."
e6hf652,Plasu,"Biologically, the hetero's are more ""upright"". It's a fact that two sticks can't make a baby sadly. And there are more consequences to the repeal than you can currently imagine. I advise you read up on the history of US and Australia after their same sex marriages got approved. After that if you're still interested, you can go read up on theories of morality."
e6he8lm,Plasu,"It isn't illogical fallacy, the word you're looking for is logical fallacy. Please don't misuse double negatives. And also, it isn't one. There are systems in place to check on the societal outcomes of law creation and abolishment and in case you haven't read, there are multiple articles written about moral degradation if laws aren't written. 

Your idea on the harm principle is also fundamentally wrong because you imagine it to be physical harm. The problem is that society is not just composed of the majority. There are minorities who are not able to handle the psychological impact of having LGBT be prevalent in society. An example of a minority population would be children. How are we going to teach them that it is impossible for two men to reproduce despite them having as much rights in the law as a heterogenous couple? And the portion about akin to legalising theft and arson, I was trying to highlight the morality of the issue. I do not hate the LGBT community but I do think they have skewed morals. And, no, I do not think that we should be changing their skewed morals as well. Rather it is the activists, such as yourself, who are out trying to convince the rest of society to change its moral viewpoint so as to allow for enforced LGBT approval by the court of law as well as by societal norms. 

Lastly, John Corvino's work is highly debatable and if the selection criteria is strict enough, his work would also be deemed bias due to the very fact that he is in a homogenous relationship. You would be better off looking for meta analysis or systemic reviews about the LGBT community rather than a philosopher's attempt to justify his decisions.

I will cease to engage in your future disputes as your evidences and logical fallacies cannot serve to change my perspective on the matter."

e6ikdhm,Christoph_88,Generally because that statement is connotated with gay people being gay but only in the shadows where no one has to acknowledge it and can pretend it doesn't exist. 
e6k40v2,Cradlesong-,"Most people would see the repeal of 377a as the first step to allow gay couples to marry/have civil unions. From that, they could potentially be allowed to be legally recognized as NOK, apply for HDB before 35 years old, adopt/surrogate children, amongst other things. These are some privileges of life that others take for granted. Some would mention that gays pay taxes too, and should get whatever the straights can. 

What some people are afraid of is the supposed moral and birthrate decline that's going to happen if 377a disappears. Personally, I don't see how that should even be a point. More realistic fears are that religious bodies/private companies are expected to endorse/condone future marriages (religious bakers got into trouble by rejecting to bake a cake for gays in the US). I don't expect this to happen here, seeing that organizations/businesses rightfully should have the right to refuse clients. Other fears include all toilets magically being converted to allow any genders to use (and therefore more prone to sexual assault), and the use of hormone/puberty blockers on children (I'm a little impartial on this).

As for your mention of STDs, the only way of curbing it is through sex-ed. People need to know how to protect themselves during intercourse. That can come with or without 377a being repealed, although I'd argue it's easier if it is repealed. As of now, schools in Singapore do provide some sex-ed (teaching the use of condoms, at least), but as far as I recall, teachers are made to keep the topic of homosexuality hush-hush or in a negative light, which may not help a young horny gay boy with questions. If the stigma's removed sooner, more thorough and open formal education would come easier. 

To add on to my point above, in the US, states that are more religious and taught only abstinence in schools have higher teen pregnancy rates. By inference, abstinence-only sex-ed does less to prevent unprotected sex as compared to a more comprehensive sex-ed programme. 

If a law is supposedly there to prevent the spread of STDs, should it not be the case that it criminalizes anyone with STDs who have sex? 377a does little to nothing to prevent the spread of STDs, gay or otherwise. Either way, if criminalizing an entire population for a subset of its group is Singapore's way of handling things, it's just sad. "

As I’ve said in a related post, positing a slippery slope is absurdist. Firstly your attempt to link homosexuality and transgenderism as part of the same general trend of acceptance of every and all behaviours is contingent at best. That’s to say it is a contingent truth. I too watched LGBT become mainstream and transgenderism, of which I can agree with the premise but not the notions following that premise.

Secondly, as many others have tried to point out to you, you don’t simply look at whether a behaviour is abnormal at present time or not and shoehorn it together. Pedophilia is not the same in so many aspects as LGBT behaviour, other than on the grounds that it is considered to be abnormal. I will reiterate again, you are shoehorning and forcibly bracketing things together that should not be together on all but the most simplistic accounts of things. "

e6hkw51,starscream258,"You make a lot of points jumping around so let’s address some stuff. 

consent has nothing to do with if a sexual orientation is valid or invalid. In fact how can a sexual orientation be valid/invalid? 
Homosexuality refers to sexual attraction between 2 adults of same gender. 
Adults who are mature and responsible for their own decisions. 
Pedos refers to an adult who is sexually attracted to underaged non-adults, namely teenagers and children, who are not mature enough to understand many things and could be victims of sexual grooming etc. 

There are so many accounts of pedo victims who had no idea what was being done to them and they are so affected after that. 

Completely 2 different things. In both cases, the sexual orientation is ‘natural’ aka born with it. But homosexuality is with a consenting adult, (if no consent, that’s rape isn’t it) 
Whereas pedo is with a underaged person unable to give consent LEGALLY. 
Consent has legal implications, of being legal age or else many rights of an adults are not given. 
Eg, driving, drinking, smoking, HAVING SEX. 

What do u mean gayness is not natural? 
Can you control which gender you are attracted to?
If you are straight, opposite sex attracts u and same sex making out repels you. 
If you are homosexual, it’s different. 
Can you control your sexual preference?
You can’t because it’s innate. Therefore it’s natural. 

"
e6lbbuh,anakinmcfly,"Where are all the children clamouring of their own free will to have sex with adults? Because I've not actually seen any.

This isn't about orientations. This is about consent. If a gay guy tried to have sex with another gay guy who didn't want to have sex with him, that would be rape. If a straight guy tried to have sex with a woman who didn't want to have sex with him, it's also rape.

Likewise, if a pedophile wanted to have sex with a child who doesn't want to have sex with him, which in this case is \*every child\*, because children are incapable of consent and sexual attraction, that would also be rape and thus wrong.

Leadership is sometimes (oftentimes? LOL) about making the tough but right decisions. It is up to leaders to proclaim that any discrimination against something that someone cannot change (i.e., in their nature) shouldn't be tolerated, and set laws to reflect that. They should protect things like race, gender, sexual orientation (I purposely left out religion because that actually can change). Then, gradually, we will begin to change society. The young ones will begin to realize that what they don't understand and their elders berate against, may not necessarily impact them whatsoever, and thus the negativity are baseless. They will realize that there are no statutes that they can fall back on in their discrimination. Maybe they will even open their eyes and realize that holy books written thousands of years ago and edited countless times by powers-that-be who had their own agendas, shouldn't be taken quite so literally. Maybe we will have a chance at equality for all."

But for the religious, who are the loudest voices pushing against a repeal, how do you convince them using logic if they see it as wrong as a matter of faith? You cannot reason someone out of a place they did not reason themselves into.

Regarding the second part, I do agree there was a reasonable, historical context for our principles (and therefore, laws), to be founded on religion. Times and peoples change, however, and the law has changed with them to arguably reasonable extents. Religious texts forbid sexual activity that does not lead to procreation, but we've removed the relevant statute anyway (the original Singapore PC s377 that criminalised oral and anal sex).

e6hfjb1,Eskipony,"That's pretty naive. This society is not one where segments can operate in a vacuum. It's pretty obvious that some religions in Singapore are not contained within their own type, but they can exact influence on other segments of society. As such, they become de-facto stakeholders in issues like homosexuality, cross-racial marriage or even just the food served in common space. Unless you can socially disentangle religion completely from issues, you will not end up at a state where there is no influence.    
  
  





  
That's just taking Singapore by itself. Our external environment like Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia have very clear stances on homosexuality due to religious considerations. Regardless of whether it personally affects them, forcing people of their religion to accept something that they don't agree with vehemently has historically been disastrous for Singapore. Look at what happened when the British made Maria Hertogh a Muslim apostate.  "
e6ibwm3,MrFantasticallyNerdy,"Interestingly enough, homosexuality had not caused wars and conflicts, unlike most religions."
e6iwywy,Singaporeanboxer,"Lots of assumptions and lots of ideals without understanding the situation.

Religion will be protected before sexual orientation as it is right given under the constitution under “Freedom of Religion.” You mentioned that there will be no statutes they can fall back on but as I previously mentioned, no one will bring up that 377A is a reason not to be gay. They’ll bring up the Bible, the Quran or their own opinions of wanting a traditional family.

At the end of the day, your argument relies on the notion that religion is wrong, LGBT is correct when the right to practice faith is in fact a universal right under the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) and more importantly, under Article 16, marriage is only a right between a man and a woman. 

But let’s look at things from a neutral perspective: You state that it is discrimination that certain individuals do not accept the LGBT lifestyle but at the same time, you state that “(Religion) is just holy books written thousands of years ago and edited countless times by powers-that-be who had their own agendas” which is you also not accepting their religion which is also just as offensive. Now the main flaw is that both parties have their freedom of speech protected as they are able to use resources to speak out on this issue. However, what you are suggesting is in fact taking away this right for those who speak against LGBT issues. Thus, creating an unfair discussion and creating a societal change through unfair means which is silencing a majority opinion. This is the opposite of equality.

But really the worst part is the assumption that “my opinion is correct and theirs is wrong”. As I previously mentioned, LGBT people already have many civil liberties. Also, discrimination is such a loose term that is mainly used to label those that have conflicting views that do not the support the LGBT communities. Is it shitty that OP’s mum isn’t accepting of him being gay? Yes. Is it legally wrong for her to do so? No, it’s her belief and there are fews countries including liberal ones that would prosecute someone for not accepting the LGBT lifestyle in the same way they wouldn’t prosecute parents who don’t accept interracial marriages or spouses who may come from a poor background. It’s their personal opinion. You have to accept that at this time and age, not everyone will agree with you and that equality, while ideal, is idealistic.

e6h1jak,Shieotenkayaday,"I meant that the definition is the first obstacle. After we define love then we proceed with the data collection and cleansing (which can be a long process!) . After that is done then we can have the conversation about whether the average/median love in gay marriages tend to be higher than the average /median love in heterosexual marriages.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear"
e6hi1u9,oneofus-oneofus,"Religion, historically, deeply affected marriage. Many of European nobility in the past were Christian, and influential religious writings did shape marriage back then, and continues to shape it today.

The practical side has to do with legal rights and legal recognition of the marriage. If two people really loved each other, there is often no 'need' for marriage other than the need for society to recognise that the two people are, in the eyes of the law, in love with each other. This affects children the most.

Anyway religiously it is said to be between a Man and a Woman. Biblically this is from Genesis 2:24. This is upheld by modern writings in Catholicism (CCC). I couldn't find a non-Catholic writing in history, but [this thing about a Man and a Woman was also upheld in a US-protestant church](https://world.wng.org/2014/11/protestant_leaders_defend_marriage_at_vatican_conference).

As for how it's destroyed, I don't really have the inclination to read deeply enough into religious writing since I am not a Christian. But I assume it's that the marriage is also seen as important enough to alluding to the relation between the Church and Christ, so they take its exactness very seriously.

Edit: not really sure why people are downvoting, but I guess people think religion did not affect marriage? Given religions' (all of them) influence on society, I can't quite accept that to be the case."
e6hbf8r,Shieotenkayaday,"So if marriage was practical to begin with why didn't it include gay couples? Marriage has been around for so long (along with homosexuals) and we only find it a hot topic now?

377A is just in between the LGBTQ community and Gay Marriage, repealing 377A is not the end."
e6hnhod,Plasu,"I was not implying explicit sexual activities in public, but rather explicit PDA by homogenous couples. As for the discrimination, I would also prefer not to use that word, as it has unjust and pre-judicial as part of the definition. Any acts against them would be counted as post-judicial and as for justice, it is founded on morality. In that sense, any action against them is justified by the law. But also to make things clear, the law in Singapore will not punish the homogenous males, even if it is written in the penal code. The ministers have already made that portion clear in order to show acceptance to the LGBT community. 

Yes I do agree with you on the part that laws are changing with time, but the reason for such changes are due to changes in society's morals due to the individual ebbs and flows of the moral subjectivism and cultural relativism with time. 

As for 377a's moral grounds, I'm not sure if I have mentioned this already but I feel that it isn't a law to punish the G community, nor is it any form of deterrence to prevent children from entering the LGBT community. Rather 377a in this case is actually a metaphor for Singapore's majority acceptance of the LGBT community. If it gets repealed, it would signify that Singapore would be ready to welcome the LGBT community and that society will skew its moral stand point in order to accommodate the new community. As for this accommodation process, it would bring about drastic changes especially in the sector of education, which we are definitely not ready for.

Personally I feel that more biological and psychological studies have to be done in order to determine the true incidence of LGBT and that social justice keyboard warriors and activists should refrain from lashing out at people who are resistant to change and just wait for evidence to justify their claims."

Again, I don't hate the LGBT community although I think they have skewed morals but I do not accuse them or persecute them for it. Rather I believe that the activists who are trying to force the rest of society to skew their morals to adapt to the LGBT community should rethink their methods.

e6hgxg0,lkc159,"> forcing people of their religion to accept something that they don't agree with vehemently

Are you saying laws and rights should be determined by whoever makes the most noise?

Look, what I'm trying to say here is that a religious reasoning for creating, upholding and enforcing laws in a secular society holds no water. You can argue against it on moral grounds, but to use such religious preferences as a framework for law in a secular society is nonsense. This is separate from whether there **is** influence, because whether there is, or no matter how hard it is to separate, there **should not be**. Forcing a Christian to pray to Mecca five times daily because it's compulsory for Muslims immediately shows that it's a terrible idea.

Together with the above, note that no one is forcing religious ministers to wed gay couples, or to ask them to accept them within their holy spaces. If they want to continue discriminating in their own spaces, then whatever - it's something they need to sort out among their clergy. But a secular state should not impose as such.

The Maria Hertogh situation feels like a completely irrelevant argument for a few reasons, chief of which is that while it is presented as a racial riot, it occurred because (IMO - I don't really have in-depth knowledge on the topic so I may be completely wrong) the courts did not even attempt to show that they had considered the appeal of her adoptive parents and returned her to her biological Dutch parents without much deliberation, hence raising issues of bias againat Muslims. Forcing her to stay in a convent and making her kneel in front of the Virgin Mary probably didn't help issues. Can you say that a secular middle ground (no idols of other religions, no other doctrine, if she wants to pray in the Muslim fashion let her do so and let the press release that photo) would have made things worse? I doubt so. Bringing the argument back to the present, I don't see anyone forcing Christians or Muslims to kiss their same-gender neighbours or being minister at a gay wedding. 

This is not even mentioning that the government has pretty much come out to say that ""we shall let Singaporeans decide"", and that even within religions themselves there are divisions on such laws."
e6izydz,MrFantasticallyNerdy,"You seem to put words into my statements. Where did I advocate silencing the religious? As much as I detest ""enthusiastic"" practitioners of religions, I support their right to believe in whatever they want, within limits. What limits, say you? Have you ever heard of ""My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins""? You can practice your religion all you want, but once that impacts others' well-being, well, there's where your right ends. 

Furthermore, religion by their very nature of dogmatic proclamations, oftentimes end up on the wrong side of history. For example, in the US, the Bible was used as justification for slavery and segregation. In fact, there are still those who are salty about the outcome of the US civil war. Does that mean slavery is correct? Ironically, it's always religion that says ""I'm right, your not"", simply because of their dogmatic nature.

And it's not as if there aren't any places where such equality exists. These places haven't gone to hell (so to speak), and family values and communities haven't eroded to shreds. I often challenge the loudest of marriage equality – if marriage is so sacred, where are the proponents of banning divorce?

Let's get back to the main topic of repealing 377A, because you've wandered a bit far, stating ""LGBT people already have many civil liberties"". To wit, Section 337A of the Singapore penal code states, ""Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.""

I don't condone any lewd behavior (heterosexual or homosexual) in public, so let's get out of the way. So, are you in favor or not, of jailing someone for up to 2 years, for something that they do in private? Do you know of any other statutes that apply to heterosexual couples?"

I find it more offensive that your Archbishop is recommending censorship in our education system. Is there a reason fact-drive sexuality education about the LGBT community should not be allowed?

More importantly, we have enough data to show that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as does not lead to any issues. On the other hand, this presents a benefit by reducing discrimination for a heavily marginalized group.

To give you an example of why keeping 377A ""unenforced"" is problematic:

Say an individual happens to, for whatever reason, chance upon a gay couple engaging in sexual activity (remember how vague 377A is that any ""gross indecency"" is the punishable act?), then decides to make a police report on them.

The Police investigates, maybe there happens to be a CCTV nearby and there is evidence of the act. Can the Public Prosecutor choose not to prosecute? If the PP chooses not to prosecute, what happens to the rule of law? The offence would have clearly been made out in this case.

Sure, the PP and Police may choose to issue a stern warning instead, since the Government says they are not willing to enforce 377A. A stern warning may not be a finding of guilt or a conviction in a court of law, but it still means the PP/Police have found that the offence has been proven beyond reasonable doubt."

I tend to look at how human civilization has endured through the millenniums by having a basic unit consisting of father-mother-child. That is how it has been since time immemorial and I challenge you to find an alternative model some time in our human history.

The various European countries are performing this great social experiment with their society and changing what it means to be family, I say more power to them and I wish them all the best. I am a conservative and I would wish that the Singapore government do not take chances with redefining the family unit. "
e6j39jr,Singaporeanboxer,"First off, I’ve mentioned a few times that it is symbolic in nature. That law hasn’t been enforced for over 10 years but still is important for those against the LGBT community. So talking about it’s legal consequence doesn’t matter because no one has been charged under it and why looking at what civil liberties they have is more important.

Secondly, the previous comment said “psychologically” so it’s not physical violence which is the main issue and besides, when have Singaporean religious institutions ever promoted violence? Well-being is such a loose term and thus, having a fair set of rules that fall under it is better. It allows religious organisations to speak out against LGBT and vice versa. It also prevents this notion that individuals that don’t tolerate them are “discriminating” against them as they are free to do so as it is their personal beliefs.

Now you brought up the issue of the old church. However, it was never a fully accepted concept with not only opposition parties in those countries but other groups outside the strongly against such as the Mongols who wages wars and freed slaves. However, that was years ago and since then, international organisations such as the UN have been established to set agree to certain universal rights(see previous comment) and talk about more contentious issues. The fact remains that this issue HAS been discussed and it is not just a “you’re wrong and you can’t see it” argument. Religion is a fair argument recognised universally with certain rules when approaching it and Singapore has always chosen to respect religious organisations.

Once again, repealing 377A will not give you more rights, nor will it give you more protection or reduce discrimination. This is an issue that must be solved with time once people are more accepting like what you said but repealing 377A will not do that. 377A is not part of any national education or social studies syllabus nor do people use it as a reason to criticise the LGBT community. If you really want to make change, raise this issue to people who don’t care about local politics and inform them about its importance or talk to those who are on the fence on the issue. 377A is reflective of a society that is against the LGBT community. Repealing it will still leave a society that is against 377A."

There are plenty of married couples without a kids. no need for gay couples in that sense.

The repel of 377A in my view is because both are consenting adult. This make a case.But if an adult person is sexually attracted to children or to animals, society stops him/ her from acting upon these desires. This is to protect children or animals who have no capacity to consent to sexual intimacy. So the outlaw and criminalise pedophilia and bestiality for good reason, to protect vulnerable children and animals. Therefor as the kid cannot consent due to young age society norm which is a normal 1man 1 woman family should apply.

e6jvqau,MrFantasticallyNerdy,"You do know the history of 377A, correct? Because you're assuming it was a law made up by the people of Singapore, for the betterment of the people of Singapore. Instead, any history buff can tell you it has roots stemming from the ""Buggery Act 1533"" of England. In essence, it is a vestigial of English law. Ironically, even the UK  had dispensed with such laws about 40 years ago.

You keep saying repealing 377A will not give one more rights. You are not entirely correct in that it's two sides of a same coin. One cannot have the full complement of rights if certain rights are already withheld from the get-go. Furthermore, any law that stipulates punishment for a certain cohort, even if IRL it is usually not carried out (we can agree on this), by its very definition is discriminatory. The question is whether this discrimination is justified.

And please stop hiding your discrimination behind institutional regulations, including the UN. Stand up for what you believe and defend it logically. Don't appeal to authority nor appeal to the people. I will further claim that in my experience, *legal* does not always mean *just*. A clear example is that in 2008, rogue bankers almost brought down the world's economy, but most of what they did wasn't technically illegal and thus most were not charged. Is it just?

I will defer most of my arguments against institutional religion to another thread. Suffice to say, I find most religions hypocritical, even if I do recognize the right of others to practice them. In this example, Christians are against homosexuality due to passages in the Bible; what they don't practice, are the other directives. Where are those crowds arguing for the banning of divorces? Isn't what God has joined together, let no one separate? Where is the outcry against wearing clothing woven of two kinds of material?"

How is it biased. Did you bother to read up on the case?


>The justices, in a 7-2 decision, said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed an impermissible hostility toward religion when it found that baker Jack Phillips violated the state's anti-discrimination law by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012. The state law bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation.

>The court concluded that the commission violated Phillips' religious rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.


It was a complicated process with far-reaching consequences on the arguement between discrimination and the first amendment. Of course its going to be a lengthy process and they won.


>Which is undesirable. Comparing yourself with the lower rungs of society to give better optics to yourself isn't right. Sure there are depraved couples and couples who cheat. But let's not argue that they're the norm.

I'd argue that being raised by a gay couple is more 'natural' than being raised by an organisation with a huge group of other orphans.

Also are you seriously using age of consent as an argument? Ahe of Consent says that anyone under 18 doesn't have the ability and judgement to consent to sex. It doesn't apply to any other aspect of the child in question.

*For example, lots of kids don't want to go to school, by your logic i shouldn't send my kids to school because they cannot consent.*

Honestly yeah sure, anyone can adopt children. I'm not saying that only gay people can adopt kids, I'm just saying that if they have the ability to be responsible parents, they should be allowed to be foster parents.

e6lw6mz,ElphabaPfenix,"I would like to say that the choice argument is not needed. It shouldn’t matter if it is a choice or not. (It’s not a choice) 


Arguing that it is a choice feels like the homosexual community is begging for approval. “I can’t help it, I’m born that way. Please allow me to live the way I was born and not have to live a lie.” (Even though it is true)


While I feel that who you love shouldn’t be up for debate. You love who you love. As long as you are not harming someone, who gives a shit who you love. Go love who you want to love.


But unfortunately, homophobes who wants to keep 377A around (or any anti homosexual laws around) loves to say homosexuality is a choice, and that one can easily switch back and forth. So the homosexual community would have to educate them that it isn’t a choice.


“It’s not a choice” isn’t the only POI the homosexual community have to support abolishing 377A. It isn’t even their strongest point. They have a multitude of reasons to push for their rights. 


It’s just that homophobes don’t have any better battle to present other than “its a choice” so I feel we keep coming back to this. And it’s tiring to keep trying to educate the misinformed homophobes grasping at straws.

Since no one can predict the future, political prognosticating involves a risk assessment of a basket of probability weighted future occurances, if you can't see how there is a possibility of this significantly changing the political landscape in Singapore, then it's either a lack of understanding of history or a lack of imagination.

3.  Let me spell it out for you.  PAP started Singapore.  PAP a legacy from Malayan Forum.  Malayan Forum was founded in London by students studying in English universities.  The leaders of the Malayan forum are pretty much a who's who of malaysian/Singaporean politics over past 60 years."

e6jjuty,lycanthrope1983,"Now you want to play wordsmith...

Like I said, it is not a slippery slope when you see it happen. As I stated before, the normalizing of certain behaviors embolden other special interest group who will soon be carving out their ""rights"". Interestingly, in the past it was LGB, then it became LGBT, last I check it became LGBTIQ.

e6lpw9e,lycanthrope1983,"The traditional argument for LGBT have been that they are between 2 adults. That seems rather straight forward and fair.

e6k4adt,Singaporeanboxer,"Why is it so important that it was created during British Rule? At the end of the day, people still support it so the claim that it does not work for the “betterment of Singapore” is false because a majority want to keep the law to protect their ideologies.

Also you are still wrong on the issue of rights. First off, being discriminated is not the same as having your rights taken away. A right is something that people are entitled to. LGBT people still have their right to freedom of speech which allows them to operate and run events such as Pink Dot and in the same way, religious organisations are able to criticise them as well as you making comments criticising religion. Not accepting a lifestyle is not the same as discriminating against it. Discrimination is when there is prejudicial treatment but as we already mentioned before, they are still treated fairly and have the same rights within the legal system. People are free to not be okay with something and you can still carry on with your life. 

But at the end of the day, it’s still a fair society because everyone is still treated fairly with or without 377A because repealing 377A doesn’t give you the right to freedom of speech as you already have it. Repealing 377A will not protect you from those who are not accepting of the LGBT lifestyle because that is their own personal beliefs. 

Overall, I’m done talking to you because you just accused me of discrimination(Wtf?). I sympathise with the LGBT community as 377A is a sign that they are not accepted in Singapore but even if you remove it, people will still discriminate against it. So me being against 377A doesn’t give you the right to label me. You yourself said not to put words in people’s mouths but in your own words “Stop hiding being institutional regulations and defend it logically.” Not only did you just belittle me by calling my a bigot who discriminates, you just called me an idiot for citing one of the most well-renowned organisations in the world without any explanation as to how that was wrong.

The issue of the 2008 financial crisis is not due to “rogue bankers” but due to negligence on the part of the Lehman Brothers and other economic advisory bodies that should have spotted these mistakes. There is no morals to debate on an economic issue as every decision made is one that is based off their own business and economic analysis.

There were similar incidents at the public celebrations in Hamburg, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Bielefeld. For all of Germany, police estimated in a document leaked in 2016 that 1,200 women were sexually assaulted and that at least 2,000 men were involved, often acting in groups.Many of the incidents involved women being surrounded and assaulted by groups of men on the street. Cologne police chief Wolfgang Albers stated that the perpetrators in his city were reportedly men of ""Arab or North African appearance"" and said that Germany had never experienced such mass sexual assaults before.

Besides the normalising of homosexuality, in western society, one is seeing an uptick in all manners of strange behaviour such as acceptance of fat people, transgender, etc. I’m not too pleased with the direction the once great western civilisation is going but hey, it’s their choice.

I’m hoping Singapore will stay out of this madness.

I don’t think I’m a bigot. Like I said, I’m not going to care what 2 adults do in the bedroom and the ruling government Ministers have pointed out that 377A is not really enforceable. 377A should remain as a bulwark against certain behaviours and as a last resort "

I'm sure you understand the prudence of knowing history, lest we repeat it? Put another way, none of the Montagues and Capulets knew why they were supposed to hate each other; they just knew they should.
You keep saying homosexuality is a lifestyle, as if it is some sort of fashion or hobby, when clearly it is not. There are biological underpinnings of sexual orientation (like skin color) and it is not limited to humans (hundreds of other animal species have been observed with this ""lifestyle""). And to be clear, I'm merely calling you a coward for not owning your arguments. I have not implied that you're a bigot or an idiot. However, if you so choose to label yourself that, well, it is *your* right.
Finally, it's clear that you have only a superficial understanding of what perpetuated the 2008 financial crisis (hint: conscientious decisions were made), and the nature of the UN. Particularly, if you so choose, try to read up the issues that often trouble the Secretary-General of the UN, so that you may better understand how the UN can sometimes adopt severe compromises. Note that I'm not disparaging the UN, but merely alluding to the fact that it is a compromise (even if it strives to be the ideal)."
e6hdhl3,Windreon,">It was biased before going to the Supreme Court. The Colorado Civil rights was biased towards religion (as you stated as well)


This is where i notice many religious folks dont realise the law protecting the minority from being discriminated by them also protects their faith from being discriminated against by others.

The problem here is that this particular case, the christian baker feels he has a right to discriminate against others based on his first faith. The Civil rights itself is not biased towards any religion.However in this specific instance the Baker's interpretation of his faith is that he should not serve homosexuals which happens to violate the law. Not all christians are as extreme as this. And as a result of this unprecedented event it went to supreme court.

There's a keen difference between celebrating one's culture, versus insisting that ""indian kids"" HAVE to be brought up in an ""indian"" way and not a ""malay"" way (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean), and forcing people to be something they are not.

Nobody militates identity, and nobody should. Human identity is something that evolves and is dynamic - that's what makes it profound and beautiful.

e6nh1sz,anakinmcfly,"Yes. I'm one of the co-founders of [TransgenderSG.com](https://transgendersg.com), so I'm very involved in activism, and it's been tiring to see all the misconceptions people have about trans people and what activists are trying to do.

For me at least, and the rest of my team, we're primarily concerned with saving lives and helping trans people survive (and eventually thrive) - helping them access necessary treatment to alleviate gender dysphoria, connecting people to resources such as counselling if they are depressed or suicidal due to dysphoria, family rejection or abuse, trying to address discrimination in the healthcare system that make trans people reluctant to seek medical care until it's too late, working with LGBT-friendly companies to help qualified trans people find job openings - the majority of trans people in Singapore are either unemployed or underemployed, including those who are university grads and might have a law degree but end up at McDonalds or making coffee at Starbucks; many others resort to sex work because they can't find anywhere else that would hire them. There are teenage trans girls as young as 13 who end up in sex work after their parents kick them out, and this is a huge problem that no one else is doing anything about.

There's currently a single homeless shelter for trans women, The T Project, and they often struggle with enough funding for food (really basic food, like instant noodles and rice) and rent, because as an LGBT organisation they cannot register as a charity in Singapore. Other laws and policies meanwhile prevent most trans people from marrying either men or women, and from accessing public housing, various grants, financial aid; gendered laws around sexual crimes mean that a man who molests a trans woman cannot be charged if she is legally male, even if the molester was unaware of that.

We have no agenda beyond helping trans people survive and live decent lives in society. Our only concern regarding children is for transgender children (which all trans adults once were, and remember being) who are being bullied or who may be suffering in silence from gender dysphoria, not knowing that transition is an option or what kind of future lies ahead for them. But even then, we're not presently able to reach out to them. If and when we do, it would be specifically to identify and help trans kids, not to 'convert' anyone who isn't trans (which isn't even possible).

I wish people wouldn't keep referring to the West as some sort of example of where things are headed. We are not a Western country, and it would be more accurate to look instead to Asian countries that have decriminalised homosexuality, such as Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, Hong Kong. Many of them have had legalised gay sex for decades, and since 1880 in the case of Japan. The West has many of its own issues and a cultural, political and historical framework that we don't share, especially when it comes to sexuality. Straight people in the West get up to all sorts of things that straight people in Singapore don't, and the same is true for LGBT Singaporeans, who are ultimately still Singaporeans and still fairly conservative when it comes to sexual expression, regardless of gender.

EDIT: I just saw your other comment regarding trans teens in Australia. It is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all. Children do not experience sexual attraction until puberty, and do not  understand sex (nor are mature enough to make sexual decisions) until they are much older. But children know what gender they are from a very young age, and the same applies to trans children. That decision in Australia is going to save many lives and likely already has. Suicide for trans people tends to peak around puberty. Accessing hormone blockers (which delay puberty, giving the child time to grow and keep any larger decisions about transition to when they're older) plays a huge part in preventing that."

""We""? Do you speak for everyone in your organization? The problem is that there may be others in your organization with very different agendas. Again using the current climate in the West for example, at first the gay community just want acceptance but now that they have achieved that aim they are becoming quite militant as observed in the recent Colorado case of the baker who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple. What you are doing is a political movement whether you are aware of it or not, and like any political movement it is prone to being hijacked by others who may not hold your simple values of just being accepted. They want more. On top of that, various other powerful political and wealthy groups want to make use of organizations like yours and the other various LGBT group to advance their own goals. This is why I always feel 377A should never be repealed.

But then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all? When I was young, there was only boy or girl gender. Now they want to redefine gender to suit their own goals, slowly working their way down to children. I mean in your own words, you stated that children do not understand sex and lack MATURITY but somehow you are a-ok with them knowing what gender they are. Dont you find that very paradoxical? 

I dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs. There is much about brain development in young children that we dont know about. For instance, the school shootings in American is causally linked to drug used to treat psychiatric disorder in youths. And these same drugs are rigorously tested to ensure safety and efficacy, yet there is still so much we dont know about and their unintended side effects. If people in the west want to conduct experiments on their children, that is fine but I would prefer Singapore stay out of it. I feel that repealing 377A is but the first step towards a much greater problem that we are yet to be aware of."

We also skew young - I'm 30 next year, the youngest two are still in uni - and the older members are even less political. Of course it's a political movement, though; all movements are political.

America has many, many, many problems of its own, including the way that many Americans are very argumentative and love to sue other people for all sorts of things. Whereas Singaporeans are stereotypically obedient and conflict-avoidant (even in cases of injustice when we *should* be speaking up), so I honestly doubt anything like that would ever happen here. If it did, it would die off pretty quickly. We are not Americans. The contrast between Pink Dot and the average Pride march is a good enough indication of that.

America's anti-discrimination laws were also the product of its racial history with segregation, and how those laws were specifically enacted so that businesses could not discriminate against racial minorities and other marginalised groups. This is not the case in Singapore, for better or worse - which is why you can see rental ads declaring 'No Indians' and such. Which is terrible, but I'm not sure the law is the best way to deal with that.

Nonetheless, I do think that this too falls under the umbrella of acceptance. A society where the majority of businesses refuse to serve LGBT people would not be an accepting society at all. While I believe people and business-owners should have the right to act according to their conscience, there's also the question of where we draw the line - what if a gay man has cancer and hospitals refuse to treat him? (which has happened to at least one trans man, who died as a result.) Or restaurants refuse to let him eat there, and grocery stores won't sell him food? At some point I think there need to be policies in place to protect minority groups and ensure they can access the same services that allow them to live and function in society.

In the US there's also a distinction between public and private businesses - private businesses are allowed to make their own rules regarding who they wish to serve, but public ones (which the bakery fell under) are not. Each is covered by different regulations and thus obligations. I think there's also some provision for refusing service to individuals (e.g. the recently-freed serial killer who murdered your kids) but not to an established protected minority.

> to advance their own goals

What goals would those be? I've seen a lot of fear-mongering around that, but with no clear motive in place.

> But then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all? ... somehow you are a-ok with them knowing what gender they are. Dont you find that very paradoxical?

Because the two have nothing at all to do with each other. It is entirely appropriate to ask a four year old ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" People do that all the time. But it is entirely inappropriate to ask that same four year old ""Would you want to have sex with me?"" The first question (which trans people are concerned with) is not in any way a slippery slope to the second (which pedophiles are concerned with).

> I dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs

I agree, but transgender children are not given any medical treatment until puberty. (Such treatment is unnecessary at that point.) Transition in their case is just social, and on a case-by-case basis depending on what that particular child needs. Most clinics that treat trans children operate on a harm-reduction basis: e.g. if a kid is crying every day because they want shorter hair, they can start by getting the kid a haircut and seeing if that helps. If that's enough, it can stop there. If not, they can continue slowly taking things step by step, constantly monitoring how the child responds, all the way to full social transition if necessary.

At puberty, if the child still fulfils the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and expresses clinically significant distress over the physical changes of puberty, they may be assessed as suitable candidates for hormone blockers, which not all trans youth may choose to have. These have been used safely for decades in children with precocious puberty, which is arguably what most children go through nowadays - a century ago, children didn't hit puberty until their mid-teens or later, so delaying puberty might even be beneficial.

While there may still be mild side-effects, the benefits in this case far outweigh any consequences. Here's [one long-term study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) of 55 trans youths who underwent hormone blockers at puberty followed by hormone replacement therapy several years later. The results after 7 years were overwhelmingly positive, where the youths scored equal or better than their non-trans peers on various mental health assessments. There were 0 suicides. This is particularly striking given that trans youth who *don't* undergo this treatment have always scored very badly on mental health assessments, with almost half attempting suicide.

[This other study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223) involved prepubescent transgender children who had socially (not medically) transitioned, with similarly positive results - developmentally normal rates of depression and anxiety, vs. the highly elevated rates normally observed in transgender children who are unable to socially transition.

So what we know right now is that enabling transition for trans youth *is* effective, and has been the first approach in history that has not just reduced but normalised the high rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal attempts typically associated with the trans community. That's why trans activists are striving to make this more accessible. I was a trans kid once, and if transition had been an option for me it would have saved me years of unnecessary psychological distress and resulting therapy, plus one suicide attempt, and I hope for a day when no more trans children have to go through what I and many of my friends did."

 WHen you say that a transgender man died because the hospital refused to treat him, I think I will need to see some references for that. As I understand, hospitals are public institution, they cannot turn away people based on gender, race or religion. Even when AIDs crisis was called GRID in the 1980s, the hospitals in the USA even though they werent 100% sure what they were dealing with, still took in many gay men for treatment which I why I doubt the veracity of your tale. Bear in mind that in the story of the Colorado baker vs the gay couple, there were numerous other bakeries that wanted the gay couple's business but they refused. It was clear from the get go that the gay couple were out for blood.

e6sly8d,lycanthrope1983,">to advance their own goal

Here we need to step away from the LGBT community for a minute and consider a few things. If you look at the Democratic party in the USA, they werent always supportive of LGBT community (https://www.rollcall.com/politics/high-democratic-enthusiasm-gay-rights-wasnt-always). It is only after some genius within their ranks realised that they could use the LGBT community to score political leverage over the Republican and gain an advantage that they start to woo the LGBT community as a means of shoring up their power base. It is no surprise that currently in the USA, the same Democratic party is so keen on championing illegal immigrants to stay in 'safe city' that wont deport them because they represent an untapped voter base. This is not the first time in history that the Democratic party has resorted to such dirty tricks, it was done before in the early 19th century with the Irish community (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall#Immigrant_support). 

The linkage between LGBT movement and pedophilia goes back a long way to an organization known as North American Men-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). I am no historian and my interpretation of events could be wrong but as I recall when the LGBT movement was young, there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the LGBT movement and started NAMBLA after they got kicked out (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association#History). This is why alot of arguments about LGBT acceptance often leads back to the discussion about acceptance of pedophilia. I dont think you can blame regular folks for it since the history of the LGBT movement is tainted with this knowledge.

With regards to your comment about how 'safe' these drugs are, I disagree that they are 'safe'. No drugs are safe, all comes with risks and benefits even common drugs like panadol. The puberty blocker drugs are GnRH agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide, depression and anxiety

> I think the reason why Pink Dot is so subdued in contrast with Mardi Gras where it is virtually a parade of flesh is that SIngapore is conservative and the various legislations tend to have a prohibitive effect on what could be on display

Partly that, but LGBT Singaporeans also lean much more conservative than those in the West, due to Asian culture, not wanting to bring shame on their families, and so on. As always there are outliers, but they're still very much a minority. Even if the laws were relaxed, I don't personally know anyone who would march half-naked down the streets. Those who do tend to be those who are disconnected from their families due to rejection and it becomes a show of defiance against that.

Robert Eads. He was the subject of [this documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Comfort_(2001_film)) in 2001. ""Eads, diagnosed with ovarian cancer, was turned down for treatment by a dozen doctors out of fear that treating such a patient would hurt their reputations. By the time Eads received treatment, the cancer was too advanced to save his life.""

In the case of AIDS I recall a lot of gay men having trouble getting treatment as well, though there were hospitals that took them in. Sexual orientation and gender identity did not become protected classes in the US (similar to gender, race and religion) until much later.

> It was clear from the get go that the gay couple were out for blood.

I agree, though they likely wanted to make some sort of point about how it's currently legal for businesses to refuse service to gay people.

Thanks so much for your time, too; I really appreciate it."
e6y6wq0,anakinmcfly,"> If you look at the Democratic party in the USA, they werent always supportive of LGBT community

That was the case of the world at large, though, as well as for many people I know, including my parents. Views change, especially when someone comes to personally know more LGBT people. The Christian church in the US is also an example of that - just a few years ago, the vast majority strongly opposed LGBT rights, whereas now more than half are supportive. And what changed wasn't any political agenda to get votes but more LGBT people coming out to their friends and families and making it harder for them to be demonised as a separate group that had nothing to do with 'normal' society.

I think it does a great disservice to the work and sacrifices made by countless activists and LGBT people making those personal connections, to dismiss it all as the workings of some insidious political conspiracy just out to get votes.

> the same Democratic party is so keen on championing illegal immigrants to stay in 'safe city' that wont deport them because they represent an untapped voter base

Those people can't vote.

> but as I recall when the LGBT movement was young, there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the LGBT movement and started NAMBLA after they got kicked out 

Pedophiles who were attracted to and pursued relationships with boys may have found themselves banding together with gay men in a society that was very hostile towards both groups and considered both to be an expression of aberrant if not criminal sexuality. This doesn't make them gay men nor representative of gay men. The atmosphere back then was also very different - even among straight people, a lot of what was considered 'acceptable' sexual behaviour, such as straight men getting women drunk to have sex with them, or grabbing random women to kiss them in bouts of spontaneous passion, would today be recognised as sexual assault. From what I understand, the climate then also meant that a lot of young gay teenagers found themselves kicked out of their homes and left to survive on the streets. Many ended up seeking out the gay community for refuge, where older gay men took them under their wing and sometimes ended up in sexual relationships with them.

This does not make it acceptable. But I can understand why it happened, and it's also very different from a situation where an adult man knowingly seeks out to exploit a child's innocence by coercing or luring them into a relationship. One reason why pursuing sex with children is so wrong is because it robs them of their innocence. Those gay teens lost their innocence long ago. I think many of their adult partners were also not aware that this was wrong, because many were deeply sexually broken and had never had the opportunity to learn otherwise. The only thing they were taught was that all their sexual desires were equally wrong and worthy of punishment. The wider society didn't recognise any distinction between men having sex with men or with boys, and so while I don't condone this in the least, it's to be expected that the men in question likewise did not recognise that distinction.

But that has changed, which is why NAMBLA got kicked out. Right now, the vast majority of gay men - and especially the larger LGBT community - recognise the moral repulsiveness of having sex with children, and if anything, they are the primary drivers of the message that consent is crucial to any sexual relationship, and that children and young teens are incapable of giving that consent.

> The puberty blocker drugs are GnRH agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide, depression and anxiety

Yeah, I've heard that, which is what makes it all the more significant that trans youth who go on puberty blockers have remarkably lower rates of suicide, depression and anxiety compared to trans youth who do not receive that treatment.

> Just a cursory look revealed some interesting questions that the articles failed to address such as confounders or that questionaires are generally low tier in the hierarchy of evidence

I agree, but firstly when trans youth are almost consistently very depressed, anxious and suicidal except for this one group, it's still the best option if erring on the side of caution; the fact that they were even alive after 7 years to do those questionnaires is remarkable in itself. Secondly, the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults, some of which is objectively measurable (e.g. stress hormone levels in blood).

Anecdotally, I'm close friends with many trans people and have had casual contact with perhaps over a thousand through my activist work and online trans communities. I've seen the positive results of transition first hand in both their lives and my own - things like friends who used to cry all the time and regularly attempt suicide but then transitioned and are now very happy, haven't cried even once since then, and are living fulfilling lives. These examples are happening over and over again in every single trans person I have personally known, including trans children whose parents I'm in touch with. The difference transition - including blockers - makes is extremely palpable, and while higher-tier evidence is understandably required to make conclusions in academic studies, it isn't something that's necessary to recognise the difference between a deeply depressed child and a happy one. While I can understand people wanting more time to do long-term studies, it's the best default option for now, given what evidence we have."

e6yfj5a,anakinmcfly,"I'm not sure how that makes a difference on the practical level. A similar explanation might be given for rejecting people of a particular race, but the end result is still that people of a particular group are not able to access the same public services.

Another thing struck me regarding your point on Democrats - it's kind of circular logic to claim that:

1. Wealthy, powerful Democrats are funding activist efforts to make more people support the LGBT community
2. They then express support for the LGBT community so that people will vote for them

Wouldn't they achieve the exact same goal (votes) with a lot less effort and resources if they didn't bother funding the LGBT movement, and instead exploited the existing anti-LGBT sentiment to get votes that way? If it's because Republicans were already doing that and they wanted to do something different, why choose LGBT issues, given that it directly impacts such a tiny segment of the population? Any immediate confirmed votes would be perhaps the 1-3% of people who are LGBT. Why not address something like poverty and class issues, which affects a far more significant proportion of the population - maybe 1/3 - and which the majority of people would find it easier to get on board with, securing them millions more votes than trying to push for LGBT rights?"
e77rsef,anakinmcfly,"Oh, it’s Walt Heyer again. >_> His was a case of misdiagnosis and malpractice where he had dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) and one of those personalities was a woman, which got him wrongly diagnosed as trans and encouraged to surgically transition - which he didn’t feel right about, but was pushed through against his worries, and came to deeply regret.

There was a time where he acknowledged that he was never trans to begin with, but over the years seems to have changed his tune and altered his narrative to claim himself and his experience representative of the average trans person. He pops up all over the place now as the #1 spokesperson for talking about detransition, and how trans people should not be allowed to transition because it didn’t work for him. The fact that he’s this prominent is actually good evidence of the efficacy of transition for most trans people; if detransition were as common as he claims, they would surely be able to find more than the same handful of individuals every time. As it is, I often see handfuls of links about detransition cases and most of them are about or written by Walt Heyer.

Detransition does happen, but for those who have gone all the way through surgery, it’s something like 1-2% of trans people in total since 1960. (In comparison, ~67% of people in the UK regret cosmetic surgery). The regret rate has steadily decreased over time due to increased social acceptance, improved survival techniques and more knowledgeable doctors and patients who are thus less likely to wrongly identify someone as trans; current trans surgery regret rates are under 1%. (I have sources but I’m on my phone so it’s hard.)

Detransition cases I know of among the hundreds of trans people I’ve been acquainted with:

- two trans women and one trans man who detransitioned after converting to Christianity and being pressured to do so by their church communities and own religious convictions

- one trans man who detransitioned for political reasons and coming to agree with anti-trans narratives

- one trans woman who detransitioned due to harsh rejection from Muslim family

- one lesbian misdiagnosed as trans years ago due to lack of awareness on the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, and where internalized homophobia and misogyny pushed her towards transition; notably, from the start she was never comfortable being seen as male despite enjoying the freedom that came with it

- one trans man who detransitioned due to realizing she didn’t identify as male after all, but who didn’t regret transitioning because she still felt it had been the right choice at that time

- one woman who initially transitioned to male to escape unresolved sexual trauma from a past rape; after 7 years and therapy, and discomfort being male, she detransitioned

- one guy who went on female hormones and found that he felt a lot better on it, but that he didn’t feel like a woman after all, and thus socially detransitioned while continuing on female hormones

So it does happen, but they’re a small minority, and often it’s not a black and white case of regret (or even of full detransition all the time). Such cases can also be reduced by more knowledgeable doctors involved at the various stages who can identify red flags suggesting that something other than a trans identity is causing the gender dysphoria, and better education and awareness for people about what being trans is or is not, and whether or not medical transition is likely to be suitable for them. (Which it might not always be, even for someone who is definitely transgender.)"

e72lzal,lycanthrope1983,"The Republican party has already cornered the market for anti-LGBT votes, the Democrats wont make much of a headway in that market. 

One may argue that the LGBT community isnt that large but still, a vote is a vote. I am looking with interest at this ""intersectionality"" doctrine that is being espoused by  the left wing organization to structure the various perceived slights and injustices perpetuated against minorities and how the Democrats are using it to shore up their voter base. 

Both sides do address poverty and class issues but they go about a different way. Democrats favour taxing the rich. Republicans favour giving business tax breaks so they create jobs.

e7mru9t,lycanthrope1983,"I guess we can both agree that it does happen but as you say it is a small minority. That is the reason why I am against allowing prepubescent children access to puberty blockers, is if these adults can regret their actions then one could expect that children with their lack of maturity, wisdom and knowledge will be at greater risk of committing mistakes where there is no going back. The job of adults is to protect children.

With Walt Heyer I dont think we can say that he is a simple case of misdiagnosis or confused individual. I think it would be a little be too convenient for you to hand wave his condition away as that. The true nature of his condition is something only he himself would know."
e6hh20d,alteredpersona,"1st n 2nd part... something gay person might have done to make others homophobic of them in the first place right? 

Yes.... 3rd part.. thats why we call them gay people right? "
e7o8y4p,anakinmcfly,"It helps to look into why those adults regretted it, though. For example, misdiagnosis is more common for adults because they undergo much more lenient assessment - often a one-off diagnosis by one or two psychs, vs children who need to be assessed by a whole team of doctors and psychiatrists before social transition, are monitored throughout, and then have to go for another round of assessments before beginning puberty blockers, with continued monitoring. This provides more failsafes than it does for adults, who could just find a less rigorous doctor willing to approve them for treatment if they pay enough money.

There’s also how many of those adults transitioned a decade or more ago, when both doctors and patients were much less informed on trans issues and more prone to making misdiagnoses. Regarding regret in particular, many reasons cited often had to do with dissatisfactory surgical results or health complications (which thus concerned surgery and not transition in general), which have significantly improved over the years since the 1960s when those first patients were tracked, or from not being able to visually blend in with other people of their gender, which is a complete non-issue for those who transition at puberty.

Another large source of regret was the abuse they received from family, friends and society after transition, such as being fired from their jobs and kicked out of their homes and made to resort to sex work to survive; the regret thus came from deciding they would have rather tolerated living with dysphoria than have to live life that way.

Almost all of these problems do not exist for those who transition at puberty, who by necessity have supportive family, and who never develop the secondary sexual characteristics that would otherwise require additional surgery or make it difficult for them to look like others in their gender.

More than that, as a society we do already trust children and young teenagers to know their gender. If we didn’t, we would be mandating puberty blockers for everyone in case they turned out to be transgender and deeply regret going through the wrong puberty. Statistically, the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans, which is why we don’t; but likewise, a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans, and treatment thus errs on the side of caution.

Re: Walt Heyer - he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans, and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis. That framing has since changed to present himself as a trans person who regretted transition."

e6t0shg,plumpig,"I had a similar experience ages ago when I was 15. I don't recall what made me so upset but I was distraught and on the verge of self-harming. So like you, I called SOS crying.

So after the lady who answered established that I'm not suicidal, she asked me what I was planning to do. I told her that I felt like cutting myself. She asked if listening to music would make me feel better. I said no. She asked if I would like to take a walk, get some exercise instead. Again I said no, reiterating that I was alone with a penknife in one hand, wanting to cut but knowing I shouldn't, hence the call to SOS. She got quite huffy with me saying that I already declined her alternatives so she needs to go now to ""help someone else who wants to be helped"". Then she hung up on me lol. The call lasted less than 5 minutes.

To be fair, that phone call was an anomaly. I called several times again in the next few years and everyone who answered was helpful. 

SOS is staffed by trained volunteers so I guess there'll always be good ones and some that really should find something else to do. Don't let that phone call get you down, OP! Also, it's okay to seek professional help. Living with anxiety is a pain and having the right meds or therapy does help a ton."
e6u11fu,bleachersandcream,"Don't know how relevant this will be, but here's my experience with mental health. 

I suffer from agrephobia (a form of moderate anxiety) and depression. I've felt this way for years, but I often dismissed it as teen-angst, mainly because I was afraid and didn't know how or where to seek help.

My world was bleak and melancholic. I saw human beings as dark shadowy figures with every possible capability to hurt or kill me. To me, everyone looked menacing and sinister. I dreaded every moment I had to take public transport, it was like my worst nightmares came true. I would skip school once week not because I didn't feel like going, but because I physically and mentally couldn't. All I wanted to do was lay in bed and feel like life isn't worth living for. Sometimes I cry and I feel better, sometimes I'm so numb and broken that tears don't falls. I also self-harmed. I would cut myself, beat myself, bash my knuckles into mirrors and all sorts of things to make myself feel better.

This proved detrimental to my grades. During my O level year, my depression soared and every moment was like living hell. I was irritable and unpredictable. When people laughed, I felt like strangling and stabbing them because I was miserable and no one knew. I would hide in the stinky girls bathroom during recess and cry. I would have panic attacks in class but I had to contain myself and act like every thing was fine. It affected my studies a lot. I failed my O level that year. I scored 27 and failed 3 subjects.


I re-took my O levels privately (studied by myself) and did way better. The rest is history. 

I also had sleep issues. I couldn't fall asleep and when I could, I couldn't stay asleep. My mind was like a mobious strip of past trauma, going and going.

There came a point where I started to ask myself, ""Do I really want to continue living this way?"". 

That was when I decided to seek help.

My parents are relatively traditional and  at that time, they didn't know how to deal with my issues. They refused to be involved in this aspect of my life, so I had to do everything myself (I was only 18 then). 

After months of research and being scared, I finally mustered up the courage to get a referral from the polyclinic. 

Things went pretty alright from there.

 While waiting for my appointment at TTSH, I got to see the polyclinic psychiatrist and cried a bunch in his office. I was able to open the pandora box that was my past and talk about my traumatic childhood and experience with severe bullying when I was in secondary school. 

I was taught methods to calm myself down when in uncomfortable situations and taught to let go of the ghosts of my past slowly. 

It wasn't too expensive. Each visit was around $20 to $30 and I had to see him bi-weekly.

I finally started therapy at TTSH two month ago. We're still in the beginning stages of getting to know more about me and my past experiences and trying to find out what I'm most anxious about. 

I was made to fill up some forms in regards to my illnesses and I was also given advice on how to handle certain situations. 

As of right now, I'm in a new school environment, doing things I'm interested in and I have friends that are mature enough to not be judgemental. 

Of course, life isn't all fine and dandy, I still get panic attacks and sometimes I lie in bed feeling hopeless and cry buckets of tears, but at least I know how to deal with it in the moment and I have a support system. 

I have been clean for over 9 months. 

I highly suggest that you get it checked out. Mental health is as important as your physical health. Give it a chance, it's be for the best. 

Good luck!

e6srdbe,greenyouth,"Thanks for sharing your experience and I'm sorry for what you've gone through. I hope you are feeling better now, and getting the help and support you need. 

I understand the idea that the others are suggesting about thinking about how other people in worse situations, but I also just want to add that just because other people may be in a worse-off situation, it doesn't belittle the pain you are going through. So, don't put off getting the help you need because you think your situation isn't that bad compared to others. 

I also get that you don't want to burden your friends with your troubles as I've experienced these feelings before too. But think about it, you'd want to help your friends too if they were going through a rough patch, right? Friends are here for each other, you don't need to feel bad for asking them for support.

They do try their best but sometimes, I can kind of tell that they find it hard to empathize. They also put their family as their first priority over their friends (which I understand) so most of the times, I'm on my own. I do realize that I'm still in a much better position than some others since I know that I have people who care for me, although I'm not sure if this will last. Human relations are fleeting and we have conflicting commitments nowadays. Thank you for the advice though :) I appreciate it. "

e6ty2ht,betterthanchicken,Your reply comes across extremely disingenuous. Please stop making assumptions about OP’s situation and offering useless advice.
e6w23w7,plumpig,"One of the first questions they'll ask is if you're suicidal. If you say no and don't give any other indication of wanting to kill yourself (eg you don't say you're on the rooftop looking down or something along those lines), they'll just take what you said as the truth."
e6t7qax,phoenixparksg,"I think your case could be atypical and the SOS lady might have read you wrongly. All hotlines including commercial call centres for example for Telco, banks etc especially at night get calls from sorts of attention seekers, crazies seeking company, help for personal problems, some claiming to be suicidal. It’s hard to differentiate between genuine cases and these attention seekers. Some have been repeatedly being admitted to hospitals for drug over dose (too small), slashed wrist ( slight cut) etc. and believe me be they will live long long time. 

I can assure you that it’s never easy for them. They however do well when it’s involves people who call when they have their first episode and need directions or those who had a recent traumatic event. Best is to go get yourself medically checked. These people cannot handle those who are suffering for sometime.

e6su3l0,avilsta,"I wouldn't hold it against you for not being completely honest. No one expects someone to be completely honest in their first meeting, yet alone over the phone when emotional. Even a trained therapist would never expect full transparency in their first meeting, and wouldn't hold it against the client if they were lied to.

Also, as mentioned, they are volunteers, so I hope you don't let their actions affect you too much. 

Also, as mentioned, Family Service Centres around do offer counselling services. There should be one near you, you can check which 'service boundary' you are under. You can check their website, or give them a call or drop an e-mail to them, and they should get back to you in a couple of days. Some of them may waive your fee since you're kinda in limbo as a student, and aren't working at the moment. Confidentiality is key (barring you telling them you actively want to harm yourself or others), if that helps some worries you have.

e6gwrcr,phoenixparksg,"> I cannot say with any authority how much stigma there are among the enforcement side but there is a chance they may discredit you on the basis of your mental health history and this will definitely feel extremely frustrating and potentially hurt yourself

Why would the ""enforcement side"" discredit her? And what stigma? The Police as expected by their remit and that of society must always check the veracity of any report lodged. That is always the first thing and this done by the process of an interview and taking of a statement that the complainant must sign. It also not done in a vacuum as there are investigators superiors that it has go thru and sometimes the DPP in AG chambers. The person mental record has to be considered and there is also referral mechanism for such cases. 

No law enforcement is going to call, detain or arrest anyone if the veracity of the complaint is an issue as it will not be fair to the other person. 

If the veracity is there, then the harder challenge is gathering corroborative evidence and it cannot be - you say, she say etc. 

No Police Officer can close a case or an investigation without the approval of his superior. 

One good thing is that people with mental challenges or challenging background are accorded special care as society is generally humane and Singapore is much more advanced in this field. There are also support mechanism that will be introduced by the authorities for such victims. 

Personally this sort of advice is best given by those who are close to that person or an professional in that field. I know of victims who never made reports after consulting others because sometimes the journey and experience of a lodging a report, court etc can be more traumatic than the actual event and or the lack of evidence leads to non-closure. 

Singapore is also unique as it is the only country I know where a Minister can authorise accused persons to be detained under CLTP for Gang Rape if the victim is so traumatised and is unable to go thru the court system and testify. We have also disbarred a criminal defence lawyer who traumatised a victim by his line of questioning in court. 

I also note that the natural reaction is to immediately encourage people to lodge reports in an attempt to ""protect others"" but this should not or never be the primary factor for such cases. The future health of the victim should be paramount driver in any such decision.

e6sbhmz,mime999,I went through a rough patch a few years ago myself and called this suicide hotline at about 3-4am when my suicidal urges were highest. I just want to say that no one answered. Maybe everyone was on the line. Maybe it's not truly 24h. I'm just glad I made it through unscathed. :)
e6s9caa,nattybattywatty,well that one I can kind of understand cause it's worldwide (like how someone is dying every second or something). The stats on Singapore makes it hit a little hard cause its closer to home :/
e6sifqa,DragoniteTamer,"Ye, we are lucky to have it good here in first-world countries. No major violence, no widespread fear of disease, no worrying about the next meal. With these out of the way, the issue of mental health rises to the front."
e6sprkk,GalerionTheMystic,"Wow kudos for sounding off during NS. From posts that people make, apparently saying that you have a mental illness in NS is likely to invite a lot of ire."
e6sjonb,MrSkyblock404,^ This is why NS suicides are so often.
e6sm5gl,yujuismypuppy,"To play devil's advocate here, those kind of people are not really mentally unhealthy. 

It just so happens that on that day, something didn't go their way. They then have to let the world know that someone or something let them down and they're very upset.

People who actually face those sort of issues will not announce to the whole world that they're unhappy and want attention. As a matter of fact, they would even want to steer clear of questions that lead to their unhappiness."
e6upogp,gmdotes,"there's a difference between someone who whines on social media (not saying your friends fall in this category) and someone who really has problems. 

in my experience, people actually going through a depressive episode are pretty low-key about it. it takes energy to complain. 

also, I personally have had issues with trust/being willing to rely on people. it's quite easy (and reasonable, I think) to worry about how others will see you. 

I don't recommend reaching out to people who actually have depression unless you're willing to walk a long road. "

e6sbnzi,CrossfittJesus,shit that is sad. maybe you caught them when they were fully staffed (not reasonable to have full manning at that time in the morning) but still. hopefully they have been a lot better since
e6shy3e,coldmil0,"I called them at 2am a couple of weeks ago and they answered! The guy mentioned that the helpline may be a bit full at times, ig it’s because there aren’t that many people on shift maybe, so if they don’t answer just continue calling and they should answer

good on u for making through it, atb :’)"
e6s9gy4,chandlerlier_bing,"That's true. Thanks for sharing your story by the way, I suffer from depression and stayed at IMH for a bit earlier this year. It sucked but it was nice in a sad way that I wasn't alone there. 

It sounds cliche but you really aren't alone :)"
e6sxot6,RomanRegions,"I was very hesitant to sound off until I met a NSF (who was suffering from depression himself) who told me to sound off asap after he suspects that I may have depression from our conversation we had on that day. 

If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't probably have sound off at all."
e6slyxb,onelastsalute,"Cool, how was your experience with the call?"
e6s9jat,nattybattywatty,"no worries. hope you don't mind me asking, but are you better now? hope that the treatment was okay for you. I had a wonderful counselor who was very caring, and I really appreciated her help"
e6snerq,coldmil0,"It was ok, the guy who answered was a p good listener. At one point I couldn’t breathe properly bc I was crying so much and he did a breathing exercise with me so that was good. I don’t regret calling but idk if I’ll call again, maybe only if things get really bad. Our call lasted for about 20-30 min. 

I feel like I also have to add that I don’t think there’s much you can/should expect from the call dispatchers, I don’t think they can give extensive advice and are just there to lend a listening ear and to comfort u. "
e6s9pc9,chandlerlier_bing,"I have my rough days, but I'm on medication that helps me a lot :)"
e6sa3d9,CrossfittJesus,"Glad that you're pulling through. I too was quite ignorant of suicide and depression until I lost my friend.

Thanks for sharing this guys, truly a good read on a Friday."
e6sa05f,nattybattywatty,"I see, take care man. Keep fighting. Life is a lot more meaningful when we look at the potentials. my counselor kept using this line 'look to the horizon'. till this way when I'm feeling overwhelmed, I'd always remember that line and it'll help me through"

Lol. Well, at some point kids have to learn that being idiots have consequences."
e3mowlz,justonetempest,"I'm so frustrated at how people's first responses were to cast doubt on your statements and your experiences. I think a bit of cautious questioning is fine, outright doubt and disbelieving is not. It's the difference between ""I understand how harrowing it must have been these past years, did you document your experiences as they happened?"" with the implication that maybe you remembered things a little differently without judging which way they were different, and ""are you sure you remember correctly"" which is no doubt a horrific way to respond to you.

I want to say that when I first saw your post I believed you 100%. I know how little this happens on the streets in Singapore, but so much more so in private/residential areas and schools, to the extent that those who don't experience it are skeptical but- I know how horribly misogynistic and sexist people can be. A lot of Singapore doesn't like to believe that this can happen and that women are saying these things for attention or falsely, but I know how terrifying the attention and doubt is, and how few women would actually make those statements falsely.

I think you probably have also had enough of people calling you brave when you were probably more desperate and exhausted than anything else. I want to tell you I am in awe of how resilient you have been, to be able to weather through all the harassment, and then the questioning and the sensationalising. Now is a time for rest and privacy, and I sincerely hope you and your family are able to take the rest you need.

From one girl who understands how bad this gets to another, thank you for sharing and thank you for enduring, and I wish you all the best and calm ahead."
e3nap0f,pekyj,"Update 2:

* As u/suicide_aunties suggested, I manned up and read the news report to make sure everything was accurate. It's on zaobao online, shin min and wanbao. All's good. Wanbao included an interview with the family who, predictably, denied they ever harassed me. They also claimed their gatherings stopped after 10pm. Doesn't matter though, because I think with media attention, hopefully (but I've been wrong before), the MPs will take us seriously.
* I spent some time with my mom and brother, who made my day so much better.
* I bumped into them downstairs and they started hurling vulgarities at me. Their grandma was also present.
* But we also bumped into a couple of neighbours who told me to find them if more problem arises :')
* When we returned home, one of the kids were sleeping outside. He woke up to glare at us. As we were walked by, he kicked a chair after us. Thankfully, I turned on my audio recording in the lift so I now have audio, pictorial and video evidence of him throwing the chair. My mom and him had some confrontation in Malay (she asked whether he's indignant and he said he was yadda yadda). Then he called his mom, who was the lady who messaged me.
* I messaged his mom when I got home, told her what happened, including her mom letting her kids hurl vulgarities at me. She wanted the video, which I promptly sent. She seems really apologetic after that.

That's all for now. I'll see how it goes in the next few days."

e3n925k,oneofus-oneofus,">... My boyfriend was obviously, and rightfully, agitated but I  told him to not respond. Hope I did the right thing. 

You did the right thing. If your boyfriend punched the other person, it would become his fault. I would rather not talk about moral right and wrong (a judge might do that, and has real reasons to), but it's better for you and your boyfriend, in the long run, to be patient.

This simply adds on to your case that the other person was knowingly harassing you. (While you, on the other hand, acted calmly)

>People casted doubt ...  people say about me. 

I honestly think peoples should do more self reflection as it is one of the ways people can improve on their own conduct. The harassment is bothersome and I do not really know if there are massive legal consequences for people charged under it but I would presume there to be little. Judges also consider the severity of harm if it went to court, so I think you would not 'destroy' any lives over that.

The cases of sexual harassment, however, are *not to be tolerated in Singapore*. Under a principle of deterrence, heavy punishments are meted out. In any case, there would be many people like you who would suffer injustice, and the punishment has to consider the uncertainty around exactly how many people face such injustice in their day-to-day lives, which somewhat justifies how heavy they generally are in proven cases of sexual harassment.

Finally, I think it's important to note that you're still keeping a reasonable amount of good faith in others. An alternative is to become very cynical of others and assume the worst in others. This is a position some adopt but one I would not recommend because it makes living and interacting with other people very difficult.

>I don’t know what’s gonna be reported and I think I need to take a break  from this for mental health reasons. I experienced panic attacks and  I’m super worn out from having to defend, explain and justify myself.  Not asking for pity here, just to clarify. I’m just tired and rather  defeated. It breaks my heart reading the many private messages I’ve been  receiving on Facebook regarding other stories of harassment too. It’s  true that negativity sucks up your energy. 

Now that you launched yourself into the limelight (especially when you have  public Facebook, a public blog, and a previously-public instagram), there would be people who express scepticism. 

Please do take care of yourself. You should spend more time with those that matter more (i.e. family and friends), and honestly the people in the public who express doubt in your story matter a lot less."

2. The departure times to Gatwick are always unpredictable because Gatwick has some of the **most** atrocious ATC in existence 

3.  On 99% of flights, the flight attendants aren't picky if you change your seat as long as it's within your cabin. I've changed to those seats with bigger legroom and as long as the flights aren't crowded, they don't care.

4. As much as you love the window seats, try to get the aisle seat so you can walk about easily and not feel cramped.

e3mvg18,Haninumber1,"Hi,reading from your previous post,i think it the fault of the parents not teaching them.it either seem their parents just let them be or just couldn't bothered at all.these is the type of kids who will eventually get jailed for their bad doings.they probably knew you can't attack them because the MP are not even willing to help you.

From my personal experiences,i too have suffered bullying from neighbours & sometimes school kids whenever i went to nearby shop due to my faces,but i don't really bother them because they will soon realised that 'what a strange childhood i have'.i always pray these kids turn into a new leaf.

For me,kids will be kids,but as a parents we need to guide these kids to the correct path.Yes most of the youth who seek to robbing people are not that bad,they may be having financial issues.

Back to the agenda,i personally think you might try to i nstall a cctv around your house(put in a place where it unreachable for the kids to take it down).

Have you tried talking to your other neighbour?were these kids behaving like this before you move in?If they did,then i believes these kids have no proper guidances since their parents couldn't be bothered about it.

Maybe seek a petition to make them move out?i am sure they might have done it for decades.this is public nuisances.i wonder how the other neighbours handles these issues so far.

To be honest,i don't really know any best way to seek help,but best alternative you might try to install cctv(record the kids harassing you or playing around your house.)

However, do remember - don't let up! Loads of people have given great advice here, and you DO have their mother on your side for now. News quickly fades unless there's constant updates, so keep up the recording and stuff! 

As a side note, it might help if you knew the schools the boys attend, and if it's some govt school, you can even involve their school and MOE. You might even want to try their religious leader if they are religious - just throwing out more ideas here for you to consider.

No matter what, cheer up! Looks like you have the subreddit on your side! :)"

Can someone help me clarify. When I read the last post I always assumed hawker means a hawker store? Especially since OP fb seems to be responsible for some prawn mee stall. What else does it mean? 

Again I have to mention, having lived overseas for a long time. There are many people that can snack all meals walk all distances and never ever be able to afford those trips like OP. Singaporeans really sometimes dont understand what it means to be low SES. 

I think most would understand your claims. Personally I have no issue with such claims because this is far less damaging than a lawsuit. Furthermore, if these are lies they can sue for libel or slander. My issue with these he said she said is ONLY when they are heard in a court of law AND judgement delivered based upon simply he said she said testimony. Ie. You shouldnt feel bad for sharing your opinions. It is free speech. 

Overall. Those kids seem very very poorly educated. Sad. But I guess its still better than some overseas places where they would have shot or raped. But we cant be comparing down can we? Hopefully given the incompetency of their guardian the schools can address this issue. "

e3mqzmr,Mosefito,"I wonder did the OP ever had a heart to heart talk with the kids in the prescence of their parents/police/authorities about their noise pollution and harassment? Or was it only just a one-time threatened directly to the kids mentioned in the previous post? If not, I can perfectly understand why the kids call you a chee-bye, as to them, you are only doing backstabbing assaults. I understand your fear towards people and anxiety issues, but how would you feel if one day, out of the blue, someone just threaten you with law enforcement and lodge complaints for what you are usually doing. Sure, these kids have behavioural issues, but two wrongs does not make one right. You are equivalently guilty of not responding appropriately and aggravating the situation from the moment you chose not to communicate them as equals, but nuisance.

Of course, these comments will not apply if you did try to talk to the kids nicely before.

Edit:
Too much down vote so I gotta use edit to reply back.

@auotts  So you are the mom of the OP, OP must listen to you? I'm only offering my thoughts here, you are telling what the OP must do.

@Jackheart31 So a few noisy 5-7 years old kids are as atrocious as someone who committed genocide? Pretty sure multiple kids were mentioned and the offence they commited are surely not all the same. Some were only responsible for loud noises at night or perhaps even victims like OP within the household itself. So just becuase their family/friends is a nuisance, they should be judge a sin as grave as Hitler?

@bigshinyponyta Fuck off too.

@Kvasiris So apparently you became the law itself, you determine who is garbage and who is not. I think you are worse than garbage, shit and piss."

Just look forward to something, even something small. What kept you going to school in Sec? What brought you home from ns? Which site so you frequent to escape reality? These small moments can add up and is what keeps some ppl going through the years. 

You don't smoke, gamble or do drugs. So if you didn't do anything wrong, why end such a perfect story? Sure, finances and social like might be in ruins, but if you aren't the direct cause of your problems, then it can always be resolved as suddenly as they came into your life.

Live your life with a fighting spirit and a clear conscience. With regards to money. You need to find the right job. Take advantage of your hunger for money. Pick a job that can make you more money the better you are at it. Like for instance an insurance agent or real estate agent. You could even tell people your story to convince them the need to buy insurance. Top agents who are really good at their job can earn alot of money. Since you are more hungry and need to work longer hours, you will improve at a much faster rate than others.

Who says that? People in a public hospital? That would be one shitty excuse if ever I've heard one."
dw3ikea,xlanor,You're doing IT support now? What kind of field do you want to work in?
dw55gdm,hewnyl,"Hi I think you have to be more persistent and upfront with your aunts about how relocating your dad to JB nursing home will be better for everyone involved including them. Since you are determined to make it work and kudos to you for that, you will need money for them too when they inevitably grow older and have more healthcare issues. 

Money can be earn back but you do not want to be in the situation where you have no money to save the sisters, your father or yourself when anything turns critical. "
dw3c1pz,salaciouspleb,"I will be heartless and abandon it all. Call me unfillial, call me cruel, but honestly, everything in the world is a transaction. I think you paid enough already and fulfilled your side of the bargain. Take you father off nursing home. Take him off his medication. Tell him to his face that he is killing you and your future. Tell him that the least he could do now is to let you live your life. If he has a shred of empathy left, he will know what he must do. This may sound assholish, but honestly, it is the most optimal path for you."
dw3by71,seanworld,Get rid of the dead weight. 
dw3kbaz,nyvrem,"where's your mother ? run away ? died ? 

Your life isn't that bad, you just need to study the system better and notice the loopholes. 

btw, here's a free (almost) degree program you can do if you still keen to get some knowledge in IT.

https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/degrees/computer-science-bachelor-degree/"
dw3rulz,LookAtItGo123,"Ok buddy, I’ve read everything and would like to give a more detailed response, but it’s kinda inconvenient for me now on mobile so I’ll edit this later on.

What I would like for you, or rather other people to know is to set up a LPA (Lasting Power Of Attorney). This allows you to nominate 3 trustees to take care of all your assets and make choices for your well being in the event of you becoming mentally incapacitated. It is different from a will. Although you should probably set that up as well. This will stop all the legal fees from piling up and shit like that. I’m sorry it’s probably too late for your dad to set that up now. But I hope this information will help others.

As for OP, you may choose suicide. It is a valid option but not one that I condone. If you haven’t already yet, Google superman and the jumper. Read that short comic. A TLDR of that however is that if you believe that there is a single day of HOPE in which you would feel happy, then struggle on and take the hand for support. IT IS NOT EASY. Yes that’s for sure. And as someone who rebuild himself at least twice now (3rd setback wasn’t really that bad) I’ll give you some advice.

Do not try to resolve all your problems at a go. It’s not going to happen. The mountain will only seem impossible.

Take realistic small steps that make logical sense. Start by identifying what you absolutely need and what would be luxury. At some point even a bottle of coke is luxury. You’ll need to accept that. 

Then work on it! Rebuild and focus on yourself. You are carrying so much negative energy now it’s going to be hard for anything to happen.

After that pray. Pray for the strength to endure a difficult life. Find sources of motivation. Stand tall and keep your head high.

I hope you will be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel one day. Good luck buddy."
dw3fsa4,blackhart_,"Well I’d say if you want to continue being the good person you are, it seems like it would get better once your sisters make it out of school and can share the burden with you. 

Not sure how many more years that’ll take but it does seem like a decent light at the end of the tunnel. 

You could even encourage them to pick up holiday jobs to help with the expenses. 

As for your fathers meds, I suggest getting only what’s necessary and not what’s the best for him, as a middle ground. "
dw3tm35,soft_warm_purry,"Sounds like you need to save yourself and your career before you can save anyone else.  It's admirable that you feel responsible for your dad and your aunts. You need to consider what is the best long term solution. As you say, you'll eventually be responsible for three other adults with your low salary, and it will not be enough. 

I think it's absolutely a reasonable AND responsible thing to do to go overseas where you can get a higher paying job and have the time and space to pursue a degree in your spare time, while sending back money to help support your family.  You are not abandoning them. There are many people who work overseas in order to have more money for their family.  Meanwhile, your aunt will be forced to step up to the plate and take your dad to the appointments, or you could potentially find a charity with volunteers who will do so.  Or as someone suggests above, a church would be great for that too. 

When you have your degree and better work experience, then you can look into finding a better job in Singapore and moving back. 

Again... You are not abandoning them. You are seeking a better life for your family. "
dw40k3m,sillycylon,"1) The work of caring for your father needs to be more equally distributed. Your sisters are also next of kin. Ask them to start taking on appointments and contributing a small amount (100/month) to his care.  Society is becoming less patriarchal - this means they need to take on some of the burden you're holding. 

2) Join the army or Cisco. You need money to survive in sg. McDonald's will be way more exhausting then a call center - and your job will likely get automated soon. At least you will have growth with Cisco. Start saving also - the money can go to it certs. 
 
3) Self care - take some time periodically to rest. Go for a walk, see friends in the park. Your wellbeing is important. 

4) Fuck the haters - if anyone who is not contributing to your father's care breathes a word of criticism about it to you, ask them what they are doing to help. Rope them in. If they make excuses then call them out on their hypocrisy or ignore them. They are just being nosy. "
dw39zq2,jotunck,"If you're really desperate and have no qualms about doing this, go to church. Make friends with people who are doing well. Find opportunities to make known your predicament, but don't keep harping on it. Eventually someone will come across a job opportunity and pass it on to you. Or you'll end up working for someone who will overlook your paper qualifications because you're their personal friend and church mate."
dw3iqmb,_blackcrow,"Well, do you have any interests? 

EDIT: Reason I am asking, basically you'd want to have something to look forward to in life. Be it something simple, weird, complex or whatever that rocks your boat. Many Singaporeans are Single but are still able to lead a meaningful life. Many have financial problems but are still able to hang on to something. You'd need to find some sort of anchor and then work from there. "
dw3j4c7,Thruthrutrain,"Hey bro, don't kill yourself no matter what. I can only say, Problems that can be solved with money, are not problems. Sorry, I can't help u directly, I just hope you'll be able to get a job and get social welfare or MP to help with your dad/family situation.

I've also thought of killing myself years ago when I had some problems in my life. But I'm glad I didn't, solutions did turn up eventually, just don't give up hope now. 31 isn't that old. Still got time. "
dw3wff7,WilliamCCT,Do ur aunts not work or something? 
dw5092b,iamsarrah,I don't have any solution but here to support you to go through this hard phase of life. You are doing well and I am sure you can do it. Hope things will get better eventually.  *sending virtual hugs*
dw50ub0,Hfujsmndhjd,"Letting the ""government"" take care of your family is the same as letting the other taxpayers take care of your family.

How about buying life insurance benefiting your aunts that will pay out for suicide if that suicide happens more than 1 year after signing up? I think it sucks that you are in this situation, and I don't think that suicide is the solution here, but at least this way you are ripping off a business that already wrote TnCs and budgeted for these things, not other taxpayers."
dw5lqyy,Rockylol_,"Saw your edit 3. Press on, there will be a rainbow after the storm. I don't have any suggestions for u unfortunately"
dw7800y,zjllee,"Man, I just wanna give you a hug. Drop me a pm if you need someone to chat with."
dw9lscr,spblind,"You are my man. A son every parent wants, a man every girl would only dream of. But before that happens you need to love yourself. If you dont love yourself, how can other people love you.

You came in here knowing nobody is going to help you and nobody can help you. Only you can fight your own war.

2 options for you, being indebt forever which is staying in singapore. Or get a new life in other country, say canada or aus.

Goodluck.

dw3imp3,XiaoMeiMeiHunter,Hi OP.  I am in no position to help you in any way.  But have you tried posting this to r/personalfinance? People might be able to help you there.

dw3km22,yujichandesu,"Bedok reservoir welcomes new sacrifices. Jk, abandon your family. No point making yourself suffer so much for the deadbeat father of yours and the aunts you have to support. It's their own fault they can't support themselves at a old age. This may seem like a heartless path for you but who cares man. You only have one life, live for yourself."
dw3htfo,Ace-Jr,Do you have any intention to get a diploma? Plan out for the long term.
dw3jeeh,alt_generic_acct,"Gosh it really sounds quite bad. I think you should try anti-depressants. maybe go to a heavily funded clinic. They really change your perspective for the better, no matter how shitty your situation is."

BTW who did you vote for? The party helmed by the guy who proposed the world class casinos against his father's wishes?

As well as the shitty healthcare policies?
"
dw3bzbz,reize,"Yea, if I were OP and had that much resentment for the father, I'd sign on, move out of the house and stay in camp leaving the dad all alone at home and just wait for him to expire naturally.

Probably the greatest act of mercy for everybody involved."
dw3cw01,GramTooNoob,"I was thinking McDonald's, does being a security officer offers more flexibility?"
dw3l3c6,DarthDanial,"Cisco/aetos work 12-14hr shifts, 6 days a week, I believe it'll be difficult to juggle work and the things OP has to attend to. Its good money though, basic pay starts at 2.5k+ without including incentives or money, but career wise, its too easy to hentak kaki. 

But as a short term option, yea its not too bad."
dw3cf0p,GramTooNoob,"In all honestly, I can't say I didn't considered that. It was most certainly one of options to take. If he died, I would certainly be much better off. If didn't survive the stroke, I wouldn't exactly be in a predicament too since his gambling issue would automatically resolve itself.

But perception wise... it is just a matter of either giving him money to gamble (if he didn't get a stroke) or paying for his nursing home fee. Funny how the universe works in a circle sometimes. I have considered disavowing him too but ultimately, he gamble with the intention of giving everyone a better life. Can I blame him for that? The means may be wrong, but the intentions were well. If he had invested in a business and the business failed, the outcome would be the same anyway. Just perception imo. Do I disavow my parents if they failed their business and go bankrupt?

Let's say if I disavow him, there is still his two sisters to take care of too. So this is not really solving the root cause but just temporarily buying time. Should I disavow his two sisters too when the time come? Emotionally, I can handle it. In fact, if I abandon everyone and everything, I can migrate to New Zealand for better paying IT job but my original intentions (from young) were really to strike rich and change the fate of the entire family tree. Reality and expectation were unfortunately different but I would still like to believe there are more options available. Perspective wise, if I suicide, at least I die a good man. But if I disavow them, I die a bad man. I don't believe in hell & heaven but assuming they really do exist, this would turn out to be another bad call. It so hard to be a good person in modern times."
dw3cxvn,GramTooNoob,"That's what I thought so too but ultimately, I think its still better to die as a good person than a monster?"
dw3f20u,GramTooNoob,"Well they just follow policy. It was insensitive all right and very non-sympathizing on their part but its ultimately business. It's just the price of doing business... and this happens everywhere. I have seen how companies rip off vendors in their business contracts so this weren't really major surprise. 

But yes, it still feels very fked up on the losing end."
dw3cu8m,GramTooNoob,"Thank you for your thoughts. I can sustain this level of spending, as long as shallow ppl don't keep pointing to me as the frog in the well who never went overseas before. Frankly, I survived not having money to eat at school breaks and travel expenses so things are already better than before despite the setback.

Ideally, I know I need to get some money flowing in asap by getting a job. But I don't have a driving license so I can't really drive Uber for flexibility. I was thinking of working at McDonald's instead. Its shift job so it provides some flexibility. Pay wise, it won't be ideal but at least with a Diploma and IT background, I should qualify for manager role? I just don't know if this will be another bad career choice. 

The outsource thing... I tried. Let's just say, his siblings rather visit them than do anything concrete. One of his sibling who works part time will simply ""not"" visit him that day or go later in the day if he has a medical appointment in the morning. And when they goes to visit him and the nursing home has a concern, they will just divert everything back to me. Ultimately, even if I assign them a task to ""help"" me out, I can only assign half the task and I have to complete the other half. I even changed the medical appt from Changi Hospital to AMK Polyclinic to make things easier for the nursing home but it only made things worse. Now I need to go AMK polyclinic to settle stuff instead of at Changi Hospital, and I stay Bedok. The national eye center keeps wanting to cut his cataract too and I can concern about complications with his prostate medication, but nobody seems to understand my concern so I just let it slide. If he goes bind, it really is beyond my control but I dunno if this is really doing the right thing. I really am tired of having to raise questions and solve them myself. I'm not trying to be a control freak but things just seems to fall that way. I really dunno how to outsource if they keep saying they can't speak English."
dw3d0ts,GramTooNoob,"So my father was never the main breadwinner. Actually the family is pretty much everyone on their own. There's me, my father and his 2 sisters ever since my grandparents died. And, its just everyone for themselves. 

In a way, I will become the sole breadwinner in the future which is my main concern. How can the gahmen help me? I dunno, I figured if I died, they can then step in and I save myself the headache."

dw3dxus,GramTooNoob,"Thank you, seems Trafigura closed the apprenticeship program for Singapore. ""This job posting is no longer active"" when I check for it. But although I have an interest in cryptocurrencies, and I have done some good amount of day trading hmm... it is a pretty anxiety inducing role. If the apprenticeship is still open (and paid for), I might be keen to try out and evaluate the risk. But well, its not available sadly.

For the shipping industry, hmm.. what kind of roles are there? I'm not too familiar with that since I mainly just do IT support. Is it those jobs where I have to get on a ship and sail for a few months? I remember hearing that the allowance was very good."
dw3tcz9,GramTooNoob,"I'm actually 31 this year. If i was still in my early 20s... maybe I wouldn't feel so stress since society expectation for myself would be way lower. My expectation of the future would probably be brighter too. But at 31 with a depleting savings and no achievement, its a little bleak. Its like a single mother trying to find a new job while having a child to take care of, but I probably have it much easier.

I'm a little tired to try again from scratch, but thank you for your encouragement. I see that you too have your own difficulties to struggle with and I hope we both walk out successfully =)"
dw3fjer,GramTooNoob,"I'm 31 this year and why I feel a little more down than I should be. It's a pretty strange age to have achieved nothing. In terms of options, I have attempted to evaluate as much as I can but suicide keeps popping up as the best decision that fufills all my requirements. 

Nonetheless, I know that the world likes to say that life is precious and one shouldn't throw life away. I am also aware that being depressed is a result of a lack of options. It took me quite some months before I decide to reach out for help like this. But this is also because I have exhausted my options and I am looking to see if I missed anything. 

I'm not in a hurry to die, so I can wait. In the first place, I can still tide it out for another year... I just aren't sure if there is a difference between going early and going later. Ultimately, I want to leave some money behind."
dw3u2ki,GramTooNoob,"I haven;t... tbh I don't believe I qualify for any help. Once I go back to work, they will probably say my household income has increased and the current subsidy on the nursing home fee will be reduced again hahaha

Then again, it could be just me and my negativity. I might try... if I can ready myself to handle the disappointment. I am pretty sure it is going to go nowhere based on prior attempts with social workers."
dw3csfb,A-Chicken,"It's funny because Confucius also thaught to not respect elders who do not fulfil their responsibilities properly. Much of this particular lesson has been censored out of what we hear and learn, ostensibly by figures interested in keeping their authority intact, unfortunately..."
dw3iawn,GramTooNoob,"Well... my Dad gave me money for arcade and on the day of divorce, he asked me about my feelings and I ask him if I can go out to play with my friends. You know, I never really asked about him. But he readily gave me money to play and I went farming in Diablo 2. Some stuff I did as a kid was rather dumb on hindsight, but he never really grumbled and I am sure I caused him much trouble too.

Although my custody went to my mother, I actually ran away and went to my Dad because well... she has some funny issue where she want to kill me all the time as a bastard child. My Dad don't have this issue, and when my mom ask him to beat me, he rather go out to gamble. I can't say he was the best Dad nor that he couldn't have done better but... he did what he could, I suppose.

Everyone has their own reasons and not everyone is entirely bad.  Its very convenient on my part to throw him aside just because his of no use now - a burden. Sure he lied much, and I learnt much of the truth from the divorce paper but... doesn't mean I have to be a shitty son just because he was a shitty Dad. In fact, one of my younger dream was actually to have a family and proof that I can be a better father than he was. So looking at that dream, I can't say I would be a better father if I abandon him now. Should I discard my kid if in the future, he has well... some incurable illness?"
dw3swvp,GramTooNoob,"I have been somewhat reluctant to go that route actually. Partly because I believe I don't quality for their ridiculous terms and conditions and that it would probably be a last resort.

The thing I find about government aid is that, they wait till you are completely down and out before you actually qualify for help. I remember when I tried to get pro bono for the court order, they said I only qualify if I have less than 2k or 10k in the bank account. That is really a joke clause imo. Ultimately, I had to engage a lawyer and pay for the court order myself in order to be appointed deputy. In other countries though, this process is actually free and one submit the document online."
dw3f9vu,GramTooNoob,"It's cool bro, won't worry about it. You aren't the first and certainly won't be the last either haha. We kinda lost the kampong spirit and we are all just listening ear in today's modern society.

The thoughts will do though, you probably have your own problems too. Thanks!"
dw3tvij,GramTooNoob,"The full story is actually very complicated and much worse than what I portray although there are a few silver lining within and some emergency plans that had been enacted, which is why I can still have afford some downtime right now.

But the house is not mine nor my Dad's. It belongs to my grandparents and inherited by his sisters which is my aunts. I have basically been mooching off as a house guest for 15 years here. Don't ask me why my Dad didn't get a new house, the money went to PM Lee's casino.

My father do indeed have a daughter, so that my blood sister. But because my family is divorced and my mother has her custody, so she stays with my mother and as such she takes care of my mother while I take care of my father. We have both split the responsibility that way. That said, she has only came by to cry a few times at the hospital but because my father didn't die, she never appear again and has never visited him at the nursing home. Actually, she never even asked me where his located to. She just vanished until the day I needed her to consent to the court order for DPS payout and she was so concerned over how I will ""abuse"" the payout for personal gain. I tell you, some ppl are really good at crocodile tears and my sister is one such fantastic actor. Her life is turning out pretty well though, she got a rich bf and is getting married soon. But that's her life.

I'm a little hesitant to ask the MP for help but I may give that a try. I need to somehow walk out of this depression first. The sad thing is that even this ask the MP thing... I have to ask myself and no relative can do that on my behalf hahahaha..."
dw3wpx6,GramTooNoob,"Wassup mate, Jesus brought you here? haha. Well, I actually missed out on a chance to get on a working holiday in my younger days. I weren't aware of it actually until 2 years ago and interestingly err... Australia closed off that option for Singaporeans just then hahaha. I tell you, life is always playing a joke on me.

That said ya, its really nice to see how things are greener on the other side. The scenarios you spoke of sounds wonderful, too bad I won't be able to find them in Singapore. I really dunno why Singapore is so broken.

But I can't leave my family behind. If my father didn't get a stroke, I most certainty would. In fact, I can earn double / triple of what I make here in Australia / New Zealand by doing the same exact job here in Singapore. But ya, I can't leave. Commitments =( Maybe I can explore that in a few years when my father pass away, if he does that is. I wish you all the best with your family though, good guys should get a good life."
dw3f6ct,GramTooNoob,"Well, its not like I don't know what you are saying. Sometimes it is pretty obvious what needs to be done but the challenge is getting motivated to do so. Not to mention the opportunity. No opportunity, no shit. Liu Bei, very good example.

At this point, even if I work hard... it ultimately doesn't change my future. I am still going to die alone, single, a virgin and without my own house. Maybe, I can buy a 2 room flat with CPF and rent in out, but life feels really ruined. I also don't know of any women that are looking for a good and responsible man. I can ensure you that if I tell anyone of my female friends of my problem in its entirety, they will just go ""ah ha, ah ha. Hmm... hang in there, good luck!"" and then they go find their ang moh friend for a drink. I also won't hear back from them until I chat them up again."
dw3exnk,thewind21,"I fully agree.

There's no time for self pity. Pick yourself up and move on. If you don't want to move on, no one else can help you."
dw3owe4,jester_juniour,"Well said!

As someone who was standing at the Line years ago when I had no home, no job, and was literally starving because I had no money to buy food and had noone there to help me - I am extremely happy I managed somehow not to make the last step. As long as you alive, as long as your spirit is strong (and it is judging from what you are writing) there is a chance to change everything.

I always admired people who follow their principles instead of following tempting trends. Do not listen to pussies, be yourself. Yes, you might be left alone, but every morning you will be able to look at the mirror and in the eyes of people around you with pride, instead of putting your eyes down.

Cheer up bro. Not sure if I picked the right words, but just believe me - do not.

"
dw3ivvv,GramTooNoob,"So there are some funny stuff in Singapore where the programs cater only to a small group. There are a couple of programs like this and for this case it is only for disabled individuals who have no one to care for them.

**ADHs provide long-term residential care for adults with disabilities who are neglected or whose caregivers are incapable of giving care.**

Another thing is the applicants need to be between 16 to 55 years old. I am not sure what happen to those after 55 years old. It's just weird but I don't run the program nor is it really informative. Social worker also recommended a program where I send him to a day care where he is taken care in the morning and then I fetch him back in the evening. The funny thing is that the van to pick him up comes at 8.30am and returns at 4.30pm. I am have to be at work in that period so I am not sure who it is catered for, but he didn't quality for it since he was bed ridden. I think aftercare options for major stroke patients are very lacking in Singapore, imo at least.

On the priorities,

1) Working on a income, in the past one year I tried many times. Self publishing book, youtubing, twitch streaming but its very hard for a guy and especially an asian in those field. Sadly, those provide actually very good time flexibility. I also dabbled in startup before and I won Singapore best startup award, but it was a meaningless award which I don't even have money to travel overseas for the mentorship programee. At this point, I am just very dissapointed in my life to pick myself up. What's the point of working hard? Just stupid paper money.

2) Can't really choose a family to born in so not sure how to change the home environment. But I try to be supportive and open to avoid confrontation. Too bad, I cannot afford my own home. Need to be 35 years old, funny rule again.

3) Yup, got the health insurance. Hospital insurance, rider too and accidental insurance. Didn't take terminal illness plan since it look more like a scam. I am still waiting to get into an accident so I can claim the payout though, its somewhat annoying that I am paying for something that I cannot utilize. 

4) When my family is uneducated and is very supportive of me going to work at a factory as a good job. I am not sure how to seek advise from them. Also I have the tendency to question certain advise because I have already considered and invalid the  possibilities. I think alot, my brain doesn't stop 24/7 and that seems to have chase my friends away. Or that their girlfriends are more important, not sure which. Likely both. If not forced, I wouldn't come online like this to get help."
dw3j870,GramTooNoob,"I thought of sending him to msia too but his relatives was extremely opposed to it since they would not be able to visit him that often. Putting him at Yio Chu Kang already pissed them off enough. The passport also had to be renew every 6 months but that is a minor convenience. To be honest, he could get much better care and facilities for the price of $1.2k++ SGD in Msia but its hard to be a good person so I just let him be.

I considered going for a crowdfunding option too but... honestly there are probably more people in life that needs help more than me. I think I am still considered low end middle class group. If someone can sponsor me to go for my degree, that's actually a big help. It won't solve the root problem but its still a positive step forward. Yet knowing Singapore... hmm I don't have money to run a president charity show on channel 8. That's why I concluded I just need to kill myself and the government will step in and take over my place. It sounds a little drastic but kind money would probably find more use helping the more unfortunate. Maybe some orphan who may become the next Steven Hawking.

"
dw3umwq,GramTooNoob,"My Dad's sisters, so that would be my aunts. Yup, it is a shitty excuse and I remained puzzled if there are no translators at the hospitals. (That said, the nursing home really has no staffs that speaks Chinese lol)

I know I had to translate once at the hospital for another patient because the nurse was away but I am sure that people in the hospital speak Chinese for real. Nonetheless, it is not CSI and I don't want to make a mega deal out of it. Different ppl have different problems, and perhaps this really is a big deal to them even if its a real small thing to us. Its just frustrating for me, that's all."
dw3v2ob,GramTooNoob,"That's up till a year ago. I rage quit on Feb 2017. I don't really know what I want to work next tbh. When I quit, I told them I rather work at McDonald's than for them. But I haven't really applied for McDonald's yet. Not saying, I don't want the job at McDonald's, just don't wanna rush into another career mistake.

I a little lost if I really want to do a career switch, inititally I was very excited to do so but after looking around, I am not so sure what I exactly qualify for. Alot of the nice options by WSJ and their Professional Conversion Programme requires that I be hired by a company and the company to send me for the reskilling programme. Somewhat of a joke clause if you ask me... 

I am interested in the social worker role though but I missed this year's intake date. http://www.wsg.gov.sg/programmes-and-initiatives/professional-conversion-programmes/social-services-social-workers.html

Alternatively, I could go back to IT but I really don't want to be stuck in another contracted helpdesk role. If I can find a good company where they really know IT instead of reformatting every single small thing, I might consider. "
dw3scwe,GramTooNoob,"Broken family, divorced after we had to sell the house to pay for off my dad's gambling debt. She's still very alive but I treat her as a separate entity.

Yes, you are right. I agree my life haven't entirely gone to hell so I weren't sure I truly deserved to be helped. Ultimately, I think I am too righteous or naive for a better word, and does not know how to leverage the system. A part of me was hoping to learn more from this thread. 

I must say though, I was completely unaware of this university. This looks like a really good effort and lines up well with my philosophy that education should not be barred behind a money wall. Thank you for suggesting this! I will most certainly explore its feasibility!"
dw532jw,GramTooNoob,"I'm kinda caught in a dilemma tbh. To me the future won't exactly change unless some disaster hits and they disappeared so I need to ready/prepare a plan for the future ahead. But it seems I need to ignore the fact that its going to happen, not prepare for it, in order for me to move forward. It somewhat of a contradiction to me, but its not I don't understand... I just don't quite see how ignoring something will resolve it eventually. 

Tbh, this current predicament is also due to people following that route and dumping all the stuff they don't want to do onto me. I pick up their slack so they can go on their merry life. Then after picking up the slack, now I feel like I don't want to do this anymore but I don't see anyone else to dump this on. So I'm forced to figure out on my own, how to fix everything. "
dw3hgly,GramTooNoob,"So... part of this puzzle lies in the fact that it is his sisters and not my sisters. So they are due to for retirement soon which makes me the lone sole breadwinner in the family ""eventually"", caring for 3 retired elders. So its not a light at the end of the tunnel like struggling hard to raise two kids. Its more like the grave keeps digging deeper by itself.

My father has bad diabetes, high cholesterol, failing heart and apparently being bed ridden includes medications from urology to help with enlarged prostate, happy pills, vitamin injections and a ton of stuff that looks necessary. I could shave some meds off if I am interested to make him die but according to the code of conduct for being an appointed deputy on his behalf, I cannot make such decisions. "
dw3d6x4,GramTooNoob,"Hahaha, I most certainty considered this too. I actually went to church at one point to see how this will play out, but lets say it was a very interesting experience at City Harvest Church. Learning about how Nike stole God's model of success. Let's say they didn't take too kindly as well when I opt to not donate. There was some *cough* reminders.

dw3vr7u,GramTooNoob,"Ah you get it! Thank you! I only really started making concrete effort to walk out this slum after watching the anime ""Net-juu no Susume"" and getting inspired. Well, and the fact that I woke up one day, suddenly feeling very lonely and without a purpose. 

It would be nice to have a love interest but honestly, in my situation... I dunno if I will just be dragging another person down. I am working instead of rebuilding my fitness level, fixing my body posture and keeping the mind fresh so I don't get all down. Gaming used to be my hobby and 2nd life but I already quit it. Atm, I don't really have any hobby to replace it except exercising. I do read some self improvement books, they were very helpful but I wouldn't consider it an interest. More like just something to get the mind off. My true interest is really the analysis of social behaviors. Part of that interest is due to the fact that I can only consult myself for decisions so I like to acquire an understanding of what is right/wrong by learning from others."

They just have no interest to skill up and I have no comments. Not knowing English and having no computer skills probably gave them a hard time. I handle everything related to English and electronics in the family."
dw53mqx,GramTooNoob,"Yes, it is a regret that I did not purchase such insurance earlier on. I have actually be suicidal for years already but I always thought that insurance won't payout on suicide. Then 2 years ago when I was doing the insurance paperwork for my Dad, then a planner told me about insurance that pay out on suicide after X amount of years. I dunno why that subject came up, but at that point... I was thinking, nah I am going to just kill myself once I settle all these paperwork. 

But then the stuff dragged and I can't kill myself... so I end up eventually in a limbo state where, I want to kill myself but I can't kill myself because I haven't settled everything. At this point, I am already losing interest in trying to maintain the responsibility but if I have to buy an insurance now then kill myself 1 year later for the payout... I dunno if I will still kill myself 1 year later or will this 1 year have more funny events that make me cry harder."

That said, I haven't gone back to IMH for years so it will have to take some months to get an appointment. And I don't think it will be helpful to tell future employer that I am getting consulting from IMH."
dw3zso5,GramTooNoob,"Euthanasia is illegal in Singapore though, and honestly my Dad's relative are more convinced that he can do a full recovery in a few more years, than he is going to die in a few more years. The latter is more true though based on his medical condition. That said, sometimes people two months of life left, goes on to live till old age. 

I vote for hammer, not lightning. Tbh, if the policies didn't have funny clause like this and that cannot be paid for by medisave, and you cannot exceed more than how much a year for medisave and how this particular option can only claim medisave to a limit of X amount... things may be better. I may even consider letting him stay in the community hospital for a longer period before allocating him to a nursing home. It's just so very funny when you have money to spend but government says you cannot use it. Then you die already and, the money goes unused hahaha... dunno if scam or overprotective.

I can only offer you a hopefully an alternative mindset. When a Plane malfunctions and the Oxygen Masks goes down they mention the rule ""Parents, put your own Masks first before aiding your child."" Or something of the like.
Because if they lost oxygen trying to save someone else who could not save themselves, they may both potentially die.

When people are asking you to save yourselves, they are not asking you to abandon others, you must ensure your own improvement so you can help them in the future. There is no point going to waste taking this burden on your own. You need to focus inwards for both yourself and your family.

You may need to seek more assistance for your father, and again
I am so sorry I cannot be more helpful. 
"
dw3dyyp,Redhair22,"Yea, being a good person is hard, it is also subjective. Its subjective to social norms and stuff. However such perceptions by others doesn't matter because you can't please everyone, recall the story of the donkey, father and son.

If you choose to disavow your father, who in all good intentions, gambled his and your future away, I hope, in future, you'll be in a better financial position, to be able to help his sisters or even your father if he's still around. It is the same, help but do it within your means. End of the day, it is as the social worker said, live for yourself, no one is reponsible for your happiness and health other than you yourself. If you can't even secure your own happiness and health how are you even supposed to help others? And by being in that stage, you might eventually be that burden/liability that you hate.

My opinion on suicide though, and I've thought long and hard about this even before this post, I would consider euthanasia on myself if I'm a burden physically and emotionally, I.E. like your father. If I ever have a stroke, last-stage cancer, dementia, etc and still have the clarity of mind, I would go wherever is legal to euthanize. If all else fails, I would find any means possible to end my life. I don't intend to have kids and I do not want to put un-necessary burden on my partner or anyone close.

To lose my life when I don't even give myself the chance to succeed and strive for myself is a waste. That's the selfish me speaking. To lose my life when I have not given people close to me happiness, that's a waste."

dw3dzou,onimusha-shin,"I'd agree with OP (Shadow_Vamp) here considering the circumstances. You owe a debt to your aunts, that's understandable. That's filial duty in a way. You don't owe the same to your dad though.

I'd strongly suggest talking things over with your aunts because, suicide is the ez way out but frankly it's the same as abandoning everything. Sure, you'll be out of the loop but the aunts you leave behind might be super depressed bcoz of your death, considering the time and effort they put into raising you like one of theirs.

What some others have suggested are along my train of thoughts though I wonder if the nursing home will allow you to just vanish like that even though you're still working in Singapore (sign on aetos etc). But it's frankly the better and more salvageable choice."
dw3d8qc,Shadow_Vamp,"It depends on what do you fight for? A good man seeks justice, but a wise man seeks power.   It depends which values you hold a higher priority.

Having a kid is by choice, but you can't choose the parents you want to be born to. It's quite clear that there are 2 choices.

Moral route: continue taking care of your dad but sacrifice everything in your life, feel suicidal like now

Pragmatic route: leave your burdens behind and focus on self-development (following the principle of helping yourself before helping others), would probably result in feeling guilty since you're sentimental person

From time to time don't forget to reward yourself with things you enjoy. Simple real things, like a favourite dish or hangout. These will take away the grind of daily life.

Finally I think your father's situation requires some outside help. Go seek it out, Google around and get some questions answered. You gotta hustle a bit to get things in order sometimes. Be resourceful.

PS: Going on dates doesn't mean you are going to pull someone down. You aren't getting married after a first date or fall head over heels for someone. Reason why many people are single because they can't find that someone and they tried doing so. A simple movie and dinner will good enough for a lot of people simply looking for company. "
dw5d5mf,Thruthrutrain,"To be honest, I can't tell you full details cos I'm afraid of doxxing myself, but what I can say is of the problems I faced - health, relationships, being jobless/aimless in life - problems like health which can't be cured by money, I eventually accepted my condition even if others didn't accept me; for jobs, it was alright, I just took what can earn me some money while keeping a lookout for other jobs too; i eventually asked a not-close friend for work opportunities at his company and joined him. It was great for a few years but the conditions at the company gradually got worse with a change of systems, and I had to quit.

I think it really takes time and not giving up hope. It's also good to ask people for help, sometimes you have to be thickskinned. I think generally, a lot of people are glad to help. Would say it's more of friends and outsiders' help, rather than relatives.

Just to share a story:
I once interviewed this lady in her 50s, she told me that she had this butterfly pigmentation thing on her face in her late 20s. It just appeared on her face one day after a day in the sun, and it gradually got worse and spread. She sought help from doctors and also did painful chemical peels and applied creams, but her condition only got worse. It felt like she got cheated of a lot of money and she was single too. But she carried on going to work every day, putting on a thick layer of make-up, as she told me. This carried on for like 30 years or so. It was only in her mid 50s, when she finally found a cure or technology finally caught up with a laser at those skin clinics that could lighten her pigmentation problem, and she's much happier now.

When I was hearing her story, I felt sad for her, mainly because of the time, 30 years, that she spent being cowed and unhappy because of her skin condition, putting on thick makeup enduring stares every day. 

I thought to myself: If I have a condition that can't be cured now, and I know that I have to wait 30 more years for the cure, do I want to live like shit now, or do I want to live as happily as I can while waiting for the cure.

After I put him in the nursing home, none of the social workers came to follow up and I have no idea how to even contact one.

Sisters don't earn much, one earn roughly $2k/mth with OT and another earn around $800/mth. Since I am not working now, the total household income is slightly under $3k and well seems that is considered high?

Maid vs nursing home wise, there are more benefits to putting him in a nursing home. They fetch him to & froth hospital appt which is an add since he needs wheelchair and I have no transport. He also needs insulin injections across the day and 20+ medications + a soft diet. I dunno whether the maid will handle that better. Also maid wise, if the maid get sick... I have a headache. I also have no room for the maid to sleep.. maybe store room but... that is kinda inhumane. Oh, he also gets physiotherapy at the nursing home, so that's a big plus. If with maid, maid will need to bring him to outpatient center instead, which once again, I don't have transport.

I actually wanted to rent out one of the rooms in the house to help pay for the nursing home but I don't own the house. Its his sister's house and they don't want to so... I don't want to say much. I'm just a guest myself, living under someone else's roof tbh.

dw3hrmk,castlesmurf,Get out 
dw3qg4e,A-Chicken,"Here's a small primer from ""The Ethics of Confucius"" circa 1915:
http://www.sacred-texts.com/cfu/eoc/eoc09.htm

""The responsibilities of the father are of course more serious and grave. They extend even to the avoidance of such comradeship with his son as might be misunderstood and so tend to impair the son's veneration. Thus, as has already been quoted, it is said: 'I have also heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son.' 

He must keep himself a veritable hero in his son's eyes, in order that he may command, and may be worthy to command, his admiration and reverence. This also he must achieve in very truth and not by deception; for in the 'Li Ki' it is said: 'A boy should never be permitted to see an instance of deceit.'

Lest the son should thereby come to regard the. father otherwise than as an ever-watchful and loving guardian, happy in his son's well-doing and grieved, rather than wroth, at his misdoings,""

What people tend not to know is that even if Confucianism encourages people to know their place, stay in it, and never strive to get ahead or fall behind - for fear of societal collapse - the philosophy as intended was also equally strict on people in powerful positions to do their goddamn jobs.

Unfortunately, Confucius himself completely failed to realize that people in power would only cherry pick the parts of his advice that would benefit them and completely ignore the rest. Juuuuust like many other religions and philosophies, really! 

Zhuang Zi (who is another philosopher - or perhaps a group of disgruntled ones) would constantly bring this up whenever the subject of Confucianism is broached. :3 "

Do not rely on modern-day religion and religious organisations to help, is my advice - unless you are capable of giving back an equivalent investment in time, emotional attachment and attention.

But if the person is mentally unsound / bedridden and is left alone. The appointed deputy / guardian is liable to answer for it for the cause of unnatural death. A lawyer / police officer would have to clarify this further though, I am not well verse in the laws just I was informed of certain obligations when I applied for the court order."
dw3i0oi,GramTooNoob,"Its kind of blur on this point. I know at one point where I was very depressed, I actually did not pay for his hospital bill and the hospital chased after the nursing home, whom in turn chase after me for payment. So I had to pay hahaha. 

On another note, I am pretty sure hospital bills have to be settled by next member of kin. Government only step in if the children are not of working age or the debtor has no children. If you don't pay and your parent die in the hospital, I believe they withhold the body from being released."
dw3k9de,make_love_to_potato,"But if the father is alive, has ongoing medical expenses/bills and has next of kin, then what? That's the situation the OP is in, right?"

"
dw4su8m,level3elf,"Sorry for butting in, I feel really bad for you and had to say something. 

You are the child, he is the parent, you shouldn't have to parent your parent. Taking care of the sick is one thing, but if he has been nothing but a burden, expecting YOU to take care of him, then that is just plain wrong. Did he just have kids so he'll have a free baby-sitter to spoon-feed him for the rest of his life? What about the rest of your life?

Your dad is the one who never grew up, and probably never realized half the stuff you are talking about or had any insight.

I've heard about this act - but is there not a way to prove that your dad has been irresponsible his whole life (you can show how he has gambled away all his money and how you have had to pay for his bills even when you aren't earning much) ?  

Also, I know Asian cultures treat boys and girls differently, but your sisters got to step up. How old are they? If they are adults, they have to share this burden. And if they had chosen not to, then you shouldn't have to either. It's nice of you to want to support them, but dude - take care of yourself first. Since you said you didn't do anything wrong, tried your best, then don't take up unnecessary burdens. 

You are not a bad person if you left - you didn't fuck over your child right? You didn't gamble away your family's money right? So you're not a bad person. Do not feel guilty for saving yourself first. (Remember ""put on your oxygen mask first before helping others. 

I know it is very difficult to cut ties, but sometimes it really needs to be done. The way you describe it sounds like a cancer eating you - have to cut the cancer out.  Sorry if I sound a little harsh or rude - I'm speaking from experience myself."

dw3k51h,TREASUREBLADE,Wait who told you that? 
dw3xva8,GramTooNoob,"Thank you, you got it correct. This is the interesting part. If he is just dead, and I deny to pay outstanding bills. Not a issue. But if he is still alive, then I have a commitment to make sure all the bills are paid on his behalf."
dw3icjc,reize,"No, income tax is paid by the estate too. Successors are not liable to pay for a deceased's income tax."
dw3eyjd,GramTooNoob,"Ok, so the room to be ""rented"" is my dad's room. If he comes back to say, that is his room. So there is no room for the maid. You can ask the maid to share room with him but not sure if she will mind since he is a guy. But she needs to change his diaper anyway, so I am not sure how much of this is a problem. Nonetheless, I try to be as fair where I can.

So the nursing home has their own problem too. Because its a government subsided nursing home, the plot of land and facilities are pretty run down. It's out in the middle of nowhere at Yio Chu Kang and looks like a run down military base during WW2. Apparently the nurses are also underpaid and as a result, their turnover is pretty high and understaff. They try to help, and he really has alot of appointments. They do their best to help but they really can't make decisions when the doctors ask questions or suggest a treatment and no family member is around. As to why the hiccups with medication happen, I am truly lost. Yesterday when I went to pick up the medication at AMK polyclinic, they also ran out of stock and told me to come back next week. It really is hard to find a single point of fault or blame anyone. I understand everyone's challenge and I try to work around their difficulties. It's just hard to find the balance and I am trying to work everything out slowly so it doesn't become a recurring issue.

Can the Family social service really help? The last time I call them up to ask about how to get a court order to be appointed deputy for my father, they were like... errr... we have no idea what you are talking about. Would you like to cal the family court? And then the family court, email me a form without explanation and in the end, I realize I still need a lawyer to submit the official document."

dw3hs2d,GramTooNoob,"I tried looking for pro bono lawyer before but apparently it is only provided to those families with very low income. The kind where, you sue them and they cannot do anything but say ""sorry, sorry, sorry!"". Anyway, I did found a lawyer that would help me for a low fee. Weren't exactly cheap but it was very reasonable. The butt of the joke however, is that this court order actually expires and you need to apply for a new one next time.

The aunt that earns $800, i did propose that I give her $800 instead since she had offered to help take care of my Dad if we bring him home. But lets say, she didn't think it was a big deal until i really asked for her help. When I ask her to learn how to inject insulin, she panic like mad and reject, forcing me to take a day off in order to go down to the hospital. Currently she is the one who ""avoids"" going down or going later in the day if my Dad has a medical appointment. She most certainty has the means to do it since she only works 3 days a week but she rather not because I'm not son and she is just the sister, in her words. Why? Because she dunno English and she don't want to make mistake later. She had alot of opinion about wanting to take him back from nursing home and getting a maid to look after him too, and I had no choice but to threaten to kill her if she doesn't stop it. I also suggest to her to get a full time job and not visit my father that often, to make better use of her time but she doesn't want to do so. I ask her to help take medication from AMK polyclinic, she also become at a lost so no choice, I do it myself. It's a very unique problem but I cannot do much about it since this is not The Sims."

Sucks that your friend can’t inform her family. My parents are against me seeking help too, but at least I have my sister.  Maybe ask your friend if they can put down another relative’s number? If there’s really no choice then bobian lor :( 
If you/your friend needs help with anything else, feel free to PM me! 

Update: I asked, they won’t contact the emergency contact without your friend’s consent! :)"
dtmomqr,HidingCat,"That's usually the case, yes.

Counselling ethics generally requires counsellors to contact family or friends if there is risk to the patient (suicide for example). Police will be contacted if there're potential criminal cases (eg statutory rape).

By SCAPE, do you mean CHAT? CHAT does refer to IMH, so you may want to let her know. I hope she can find a therapist that she can work well with.

Finally if you want to talk more drop me a line with more details. In the meantime stay strong! Don't forget to take care of yourself!"
dtnppqo,stephaniechuuu,Has she tried seeking general hospital psychologists? It could be that the therapy they use at IMH is not suitable for her as there are different kind of therapies that can be used to aid those who are suffering from mental health issues.

d1g26fl,lordkronos,"Thanks OP, the most people start getting depression around ages 20-24 and they're usually not at a state where they can comfortably fund their own treatment. 

Mental health is still a stigmatized issue in Singapore and the more people can learn and benefit from mental health care, the better. "
d1g3sni,petit_four,"On a related note - some resources for counselling/psychotherapy that have fee waivers:

Clarity Singapore: http://www.clarity-singapore.org/contact-us.html [was told that most of the clients receive the waiver]

JCU: https://www.jcu.edu.sg/student-life/student-support-services/psychology-clinic"

I have lost a few friends due to psychiatric-related issues.. I have seen my childhood friend leap off the building, before my very eyes.

Had to fund IMH appointments from my own allowance, because parents think that ""its just a phase"".  Stopped because I really canot afford it anymore. But I grew to live with it. I needed help but nobody was there, I know how it feels...

I hope anybody with a few extra bucks can chip in and help those in need.

d1g0we6,laoniang,"You're right about that. However, removing stigma requires the time of a generational shift. I intend to work my way into that by letting others know that one can seek help for mental illnesses, yet be no less a functional member of society. Making it the new normal, if you'd like."
d1g2rkh,,"Yeah, sadly there's this stigma in Singapore where if one declares they're depressed or mentally unwell, people just assume you're weak or drawing attention to yourself. I've seen it in a lot of places, like among secondary and jc students.

d1g8ulw,laoniang,Yaaaaaas I love pizza.
d1g3xrq,emptygaps,"I really like the idea! Maybe you could focus it to students who are secretly getting help for themselves, where they need the start first before fully telling their parents. This creates some sort of support from professionals first, before breaking the very difficult news to their parents. I am not able to fund though :(

On a related note, there is a free mental health check offered by the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT). It assesses you whether you might have a mental health issue, and refers you to subsidised rate at IMH/local hospitals. They can refer you to community resources if you want, too! https://chat.mentalhealth.sg/ they are conveniently located in Orchard!

I think once their parents know, then their parents can take over and/or visit the MSW if they can't pay! That's what I did... I went secretly first, parents got to know, and then now I am on Medifund, which I can pay on my allowance since my parents are not really keen on paying for psychiatric treatment (which they think is redundant)."
d1g2uu3,Hope83,"I don't mind chipping in as well but would like to point out that those who are from low income families background can actually go to the medical social workers to seek financial assistance instead.

I like your idea! Primarily I created this post with the students in mind. However, I thought it would be so targeted that I would miss those that don't fall in the criteria. So I'm opening it to the rest too. Maybe a support group for students should be started huh."
d1h320g,orangesalt,"hi! :) while CHAT does do good work, I've unfortunately found them fairly unhelpful because they are specifically looking for people who have not had any contact with mental health services in SG at all. I've exited my therapy program for varying reasons including cost and general ineffectiveness, but it seems like re-entering the system is much harder than a fresh patient looking for help.

Would you be able to recommend an organisation that I can call with regard to a case like this?"
d1g3scz,laoniang,"Haha, I'm not sure how I can aggressively promote this. Or if I should. Honestly, I don't earn a lot and am only able to afford one person's treatment for a year or so.

d1g3gc0,petit_four,On paper they're not supposed to be discriminatory and the declaration is supposed to help the school help you - and schools do state that on their applications. From anecdotal evidence from friends though: I suspect that it does count against you if it comes down to Candidate A vs Candidate B with all other things being equal.
d1g3h7y,petit_four,Depends on presenting issue. Got [incorrectly] bounced to IMH for sleep disorder; that was a 2 month waiting list; referral from IMH to SGH took another 2 months.
d1g6c83,emptygaps,"Nah, not weird. Just that they don't agree to this. Even with multiple family meetings with the psychiatrist, it's hard for them to understand. Just typical Asian reactions.

I think you can do a funding if it's a pool of money! Support groups might not be a great idea sometimes, because 1) you need to prioritise yourself (i.e. self-care) and 2) you really need to watch what you say... but if it's a warm environment, then why not!"
d1hdo4a,emptygaps,"hello! what did CHAT say to you?

if not, then why not just get a referral from the polyclinic?"
d1g41en,Hope83,"If supposed you really would like to see someone take up the offer, can always dig through the threads over the last 3 months with a few searches via keywords and pm those redditors individually to see whether they would be keen to take your offer up. A few of them were using throwaway or semi-active accounts though iirc.

Psychiatric treatments can add up to quite a fair bit even if it's under subsidized treatments and I am wondering how would the claims be made. Its not like u are just going to give them cash and hope that they will really go and see the doc.

"
d1g9295,shortglass,"Fair enough, though I'd say it depends on the factors underlying the specific mental issues. OCD/anxiety issues because of e.g. work stress? If you eliminate the stressor by changing jobs, for example, in essence you are 'curing' the mental issue. Just like how if you get constant backaches due to improper seating posture, by tackling the posture issue you may alleviate the physical problem. 

Of course, for disorders rooted in biology a 'cure' is much harder to achieve, but through medication and psychological interventions may be manageable. "
d1g7a6y,slackerism,Glad mine's liberal
d1hg7bl,orangesalt,"they said that bc i've had contact with the mental health system before, i should know where to go. i called to ask if I can arrange for a session as a second opinion on whether I have BPD, as well as recommendations for places that have experience treating it. that would specifically mean DBT and core trauma/schema therapy, which is less common that CBT and talk therapy.

i believe that i'm not properly diagnosed initially (BPD vs depression) because:
a) i'm not old enough yet. some countries want to wait until 21 before deciding that someone's essentially emotionally uncontrollably unstable instead of just being a teenager
b) healthcare systems generally stigmatise BPD people as hard to treat etc, hence the hesitance from my previous psychologist to get it written down. it also doesn't help that a lot of BPDers drop out once they are told that they have this. she's hinted at the idea, and my therapist used exercises meant for BPD (saw it on the footer of the page).
c) they're often comorbid.

i'm just afraid that i'll be wasting everyone's time if i didn't know what people were more enabled to handle. polyclinic would be my go-to, once i know which organisation to find, or even request a specific practitioner."
d1g4bb8,laoniang,"I hardly go on reddit anymore, but I do go on a scout and PM once in a while. But it's mostly throwaways and I usually get no replies. Hopefully, this post will draw those that are still around.

Good question. Haven't thought about how the claims will be made. I only know how much I can offer per person (around the range of $40 - $60 a month) and I'm just going to give that amount on a trust system. My only condition is that he/she will give me proof that they followed through their treatment e.g. monthly prescription/evidence of appointment"
d1g9ps4,,[deleted]
d1hgcdq,emptygaps,"ah. i think if you explained to CHAT your circumstances they might try? they were nice to me.

as for polyclinic referrals, they would refer you to a psychiatrist first tho. are you open to that? only after you meet the psychiatrist then the psychiatrist can refer you to therapy...

otherwise look at clarify and JCU, or some FSCs. JCU uses students in training, though. sure there'll be supervisors, but you need to be comfortable with that."
d1hi5z6,petit_four,"Do you think it's worth a shot just not mentioning prior contact to mental health services? I was thinking of going for it and seeing where it led me too. Have previously seen p.docs, psychs and counsellors in private practice, school and in govt hospitals, but was hoping for fresh options now that I'm no longer seeing said parties."
d1g4j2t,Hope83,"Well, let me know if there are any who does take up on the offer and if help is required. 

It's a noble effort and I do hope someone does get helped by this."
d1g70zd,emptygaps,"Actually my question to you is: how will you fund them if they are on non-standard drugs? Meaning non-subsidised drugs.

A month's worth of escitalopram (Lexapro) on 20mg (max dose) is around 120. Not including consult, which is around 30 if they are not on CHAS. Then psychotherapy is 32. If needed, then the person might have to go for occupational therapy, an added 32. Group psychotherapy is around 40.

So it adds up actually. Will you be able to bear the cost? I know this goes against my previous posts but when you think about it: will you be able to sustain this? What about dependance? What if the person is too dependent on you? What if you, relapse, and need the funds?"
d1ghl9d,shortglass,"Yep, it is never a simple affair in diagnosing/treating mental disorders. Probably why multifactorial approaches are becoming more common. Alas, there is still a whole lot more we *don't* know about the human mind :/"
d1hkjcf,orangesalt,"It would, but they should always ask bc it's part of protocol I think. Always tell the truth though! Don't push it just so they help you or anything, if you need to drop it for the sake of integrity then do that"
d1g89we,laoniang,"Thanks for asking this question. I didn't think so deeply. I honestly won't be able to cover all the other costs, save for what's the most basic i.e. psychiatrist consultation + generic drugs. 

My hard limit on what I can offer to that person would be $60 a month, and hope he/she will stretch that and be able to add on for the peripherals himself/herself. Factoring my own financial status in the near future, I can only be confident of sponsoring for a year or so. Hopefully longer than that. We can look into other schemes to tap on, I'm sure.

I'm finally getting some responses from those who need help in the last hour. There's been a few users PM-ing me and commenting to ask to contribute to a common pool. I'm embarrassed to say that I might have to just take that up but I don't know how to organize this either :("

ctbdweg,DjSynergy,"I'm no expert in dating advice, hell I don't even have a girlfriend. But I think staying faithful to her as well as trying to spend as much time with her as possible would be the best option, until you guys have enough to move out and stay in a house of your own. Try to distance her from her family and confront but in a calm manner when, if her parents ever come to realise that she's being independent more than half the time of her life."
ctbpeku,thrwaysgacc,"Thank you all for replying, I really appreciate it. 


Ok my GF has thought of moving out. I have offered to help chip in until she has a permanent job. However as her school fees for her degree was paid for by her other elder sibling (started working for a few years so could afford to pay first), my GF feels obligated to pay back the amount first. 


She also plans to give allowance to her parents too (I told her not to but she insists, I can't change her mind on this). So after planning her finance if she wants to move out she won't have any much money left. 


I do wish she could move in with me but I'm still living with my parents and there isn't a spare room. I still think this is a future possibility so I will try to work it out. "
ctbf9l7,Hope83,"The quickest ""solution"" given that she's in her 20s and already graduated is for her to move out. Rent a place somewhere, or stay with you for the immediate time being. Note that in both cases, there will be other repercussions to come should her parents pursue the matter that may make her feel worse but it still looks better than continuing to stay with her family.

After which you will have to monitor to see if things improve in her emotional and mental state. 

In the meantime, bring her to see a counselor
"
ctbi7vu,highdiver_2000,"If she can't move out,  I would suggest  spending  minimal time at home. Slowly  wind down  all interactions.  

Yes it is tough  putting up with snarky remarks  all the time. 

Some mothers favour males for reasons I could never fathom. "
ctbj3w1,Pinkpotatopew,"The solution is pretty obvious. Shes no longer a teen, shes a young adult. She can move out.

To your place perhaps?"
ctblpu1,Jeppoplays,"The most important thing for you to do is listen. Make sure she knows that you're there for her and she can safely tell you anything. Don't give advice unless she specifically asks for it, just listen and be there for her. Encourage her to talk to you, or someone she trusts, but don't force it, let her speak when she's ready."
ctblss4,WWJE,"Hi OP, I don't know you or your girlfriend, so I don't feel comfortable prescribing a solution with my lack of information. But you mention she might be depressed, and even with what little you've already told us, it sounds very plausible that her mental health is at risk. 

I urge you both to seek help from trained mental health professionals. I know it sounds daunting but please don't let the fear of stigmatization hold you back. If cost is an issue, get a referral from a polyclinic. Bring the police report about the suicide attempt incident."
ctbo1jt,chewkachu,"If you're serious about the relationship, propose to her and talk to your family about letting her stay with you. 
"
ctbom5t,evilplushie,"No offense, but she needs therapy. Moving out won't solve everything I think; plus this being Singapore, she may not have the finances to move out. I say this mostly because she knew the accusation was false but somehow got heated enough to want to use a penknife and kill her mother then herself. This isn't normal. 

As it is, you can't do anything to help her but convince her to a) move out and b) get therapy. "
ctbwrl8,eStonez,"Like other people said here. Ask/Help her to move out. If she is in her 20s, there shouldn't be any legal complication about doing it. 

Living together with toxic people will make anyone depressed. I do leave my own home since I was 19. (by studying+working away from home and never went back, except annual visiting.) My parents/family are not bad people but they are business minded, money oriented and very vocal about my profession/choice of study. (e.g: How much I earned is same as their blue collar worker, they have more than 10 workers.) Words came out from them usually are not kind/gentle one. And they are very pushy people with no sense of personal privacy/boundary. For me .. leaving my own house at 19 (with their financial support) mean, I have to ""trial-live"" on my own without car, cooked meal, washer, maids and everything else. But I believe that was my best decision.

I don't know how much money she can make, I hope she can afford around 400$~500$ for rental. I don't know where she live/work but room-rental around Sengkang area is quite cheap. A lot of home owners want to rent one room to single female for 450~500$. If you guys move in together, you could get a master bedroom for about 700~900."
ctbgqe5,MaddST,Best solution now is to move her out. Possibly you place? Get her out of her house and parents for now. 
ctbiyct,kyith,"i am hearing only one side of the story. to be fair. i have a colleague in the same situation, once moved out from her parents, now on better terms.

there is a communications issue, by her parents, perhaps. have you tried to mediate?

to be fair, what the parents use, a lot of friends also use it on their peers."
ctbmonm,TeaWithMilk83,"I can understand in living in a difficult enviroment is tough. Favoritism is real and i have experienced it myself.

Most of the parents now, when they are growing up have their own kind of mindset and mentality and also attributing their own enviroment pushes their way of living towards their children.

I believe the GF's mom has her own mindset and stance towards money and thus for behaving that way. 

I would strongly advise you, to just be there for her most of the time now, often letting her know that you will be there her, try to help her be strong, not just because of this situation also but because to Live is to be strong, death is always the quickest solution and often not the answer. 

Moving out is a temporarily solution and might not help the underlying issues. (relationship with the family)

Being strong means, she has to accept facts and unfairness that is dealt to her, she has to know she can change her enviroment in due time, she know that something to live for is worth that wait.



You can be that wait. Just make her believe so.

Moving out and cutting ties isn't as simple as one think. 
No matter what the parents did raised her. Unless you have evidence of child abuse or what not. Do not hesitate to contact social services."
ctbq9t8,coffeeandsex,"Speaking from similar experience, if you can't bring her to your home to stay, help her find a room for rent outside. You can share the rent to help her, even move out and stay with her (assuming you are currently staying with parents)."
ctbqx2i,Pollenset,"She needs to get out of there. Also, please see if she can go to counselling and talking to someone. So many people see this as a bad thing, that its weird and shit, but it couldnt be further from the truth. Maybe she is one of those and wouldnt get that kind of help ... One way you can do this. .. if by approaching her and saying, that *you'd* like to talk to someone about feeling a bit down ... would she maybe like to come to one of the sessions as moral support?

ctbv74u,bleahz,"Hmm for me it's.. Once I'm home, back
 to my room. I don't hv a choice and I'm the only child. Moving out depletes my savings as I also hv to contribute to the house since its not fully paid.

But when times to get rough, you  yourself may need someone to lean on. Make sure you have a strong  social support too. Your mental health still  matters no matter what in order for you to help your gf through her hard times and to support yourself too. "
ctby9ix,TheBoyWhoHatesYou,"I know it may seem very unfilial and a very ridiculous concept for someone to leave their parents and cut off relation with them.  This is because we grow up in a more traditional minded country. If her situation is very bad, you should maybe encourage her to leave her family? This will be difficult as housing and money will be an issue in our society.  Show her your support, she is unable to reach out to her family,  be there for her.  Maybe you can send her to some psychiatric programme,  so that she can handle her feeling better and thus not leading to suicide   I feel this will help her A LOT.  Good Speed OP"

Might. I really feel that most of the time instead solving people's problems it's more effective to talk about how hard things are. It would make you girlfriend feel so much better, if you just assure her that you understand how hard it is.

Keep asking her ""it' hard right?"" she'll agree, but feel better. It's counter-intuitive. It's a start."
ctbnvde,damnsadnewman,"ok let me try to help
how long have you been with her, do you **REALLY** know what is going on? why do the mom dislike her that much, what is the reason? are you involved in this? are you the bad company that her mom want you out of her life?

as long as your gf can work and not rely from the parent, and **STOP** taking money from them. she can note it down and tell the parent to stfu and show evidence that it was her money, then point at bro not working getting freebies and walk away.

after a few time, the mom should stop kpkb as she see that there is no point getting shoot everytime.

it works on my family, at times your gf should buy gifts to the parent, celebrate special occasion with them, instead of fire fighting, your gf should rebuild the relationship. "

ctbk95q,CANTgetAbuttPREGNANT,"With all due respect, leave this relationship and move on.  Life has enough drama on its own.  Unless you have similar problems with your own family already, you shouldn't have to deal with all of this.  There are so many people out there to love and who will love you that you shouldn't have to deal w/ this mess.  I know it sounds a bit cold, because she shouldn't have to ""pay"" for her poor family situation, however, you only get 1 life, and there is no reason for you to choose to live through someone else's serious drama."
ctbrprm,not_a_theorist,"This is so difficult to do in Singapore. I have another friend who's in a similar situation as OP's girlfriend and I'm sure things will improve if my friend moved out but there's just no place where she can go. It's such a small overcrowded place, Singapore."
ctbhsv8,dashrandom,"Wow I didn't know this exists, time to check in. 

Anyway OP some advice: since your gf is more or less financially independent, she needs to make the fact known to her parents. Whenever my mum wants to do stupid things like that to me, I always issue an ultimatum: do you want to keep quiet / stop talking about that so we can have a nice evening together? 

I'll ask 3 times, repeating the number of times I have issued this ultimatum. On the third time, I'll specifically mention this is the last time. If she continues talking, I walk away. Out of the house or wherever if I need to. 

The most infuriating thing you can do to someone who wants to tell you shit is to not take it. Simple as that. "
ctch43j,shxwn,"Hi, if your gf knows about reddit, get her to really read /r/raisedbynarcissists, it may help her realise who she's dealing with, and not feel guilty.  
&nbsp;  
I say this because wanting to kill your own mother and insisting on giving a portion of your salary to that same person really does not go hand in hand. I suspect, on the slightest of inklings, that she insists on giving the allowance possibly due to asian values, expectations as well as the feeling of guilt that narcissistic parents are so very good at instilling in their victims."
ctbvmkw,dashrandom,"> She also plans to give allowance to her parents too (I told her not to but she insists, I can't change her mind on this). 

Actually by law, she has to, so this is a smart move.

OP, moving out is drastic, but may be needed. I cannot be the judge of this as I am not your gf. Whatever decision she makes, please support her, even if she chooses not to move out.

Something you can get your girlfriend help deal with toxic relatives is to read The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. Once you recognise the little tricks people pull to control you, you learn to stop being affected by them."
ctbqfpq,mwolfee,"How much is not enough? Could you help her out? IMO if you're not starving every month scraping the bottom of the barrel, one's sanity is pretty important.

ctbps1p,thrwaysgacc,"Yes, unfortunately I wish to propose to her in a memorable way, you know? So I still got to earn money before doing so. "
ctbro7w,thrwaysgacc,Thank you! Yup another possibility is me moving in with her. I don't know how much rent would cost though if we rented a room meant for 2 adults. I appreciate bringing up another alternative option though. Just have to talk with my GF about it too. 
ctbreyd,thrwaysgacc,"Yes, but she was sent to IMH first for assessment. Luckily no jail term.

* since primary school, whenever my GF brought friends back from school her mother would question them. Like what their parents did. Where they stayed.
* constantly vent anger on her. Their retail business is terrible, so when they lose money they would shout and insult verbally at my GF


I wouldn't say I'm bad company. I don't smoke. I don't go clubbing nor drink alcohol till dirt drunk. 

During NS my family decided to get a family car. So if I'm able to use the car, I would bring her out. Sometimes if I join her family for family dinner at places, I would offer them my car too. Not to mention I have to endure sarcastic remarks from her mother like ""wah your family so rich can buy car for you to drive"" "
ctbl5nu,km55,"so what you're saying is ... right when the girlfriend feels she has no one else to turn to, to leave her? really? whatever happened to sticking together, in good times, or bad? 

i have to strongly disagree with you ... it seems OP and gf get along just fine, and her family (and her not getting along with them) is the root cause. maybe all they need is some distance between them to try and mend the relationship."
ctbvjp4,hannorx,"Yeah, I understand that. Even as I was typing that reply, I was concerned that it might not be a possibility for her to move out, which is why I suggested that she lives with her boyfriend till her situation is sorted.

I honestly can't think of other better solutions. "
ctbrzc1,,"Yeah such situations are pretty common in Singapore, and the population density/housing prices exacerbate the problem by making it difficult to get away from the situation.

ctc86ui,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,"Tons of foreign students are in the same situation (the accommodation seeking, not the toxic environment) upon graduation every year, so I am finding it a little hard to believe it is THAT difficult.

ctbpvxl,thrwaysgacc,"Thank you. Yes I did tell her to set an ultimatum. If her mother starts provoking or insulting her, just walk away. She still is bad at controlling her temper. So she would still get angry. I think her mother enjoys it when she successfully provokes my GF. Kinda like a fucking sadist. "
ctbs0gh,,"I've ignored my mother for a good number of years now and I can say my quality of life has only gone up. Same with other players in online games, or altercations IRL. They're all one and the same: mere distractions. I guess to get to my stage where nothing affects you, one would have to already have tons of experience with having shit affect you. Just like any other skill, really. The more shit you take, the higher your shit resistance. All about dem shit gains, son."

ctbrl5a,thrwaysgacc,"I offer to help her out, as I have saved up money from allowance, but she refused to accept my offer as she 'doesn't want to owe me any further'.

ctbsl6f,chewkachu,"Yeeeeah, rather unthoughtful suggestion, apologies. 

Anyhow, I think she needs to move out and get some distance from her family. Maybe it would also make her mother appreciate her more, when her presence is missing.

ctc0qbu,swordtailsg,"Where did she get her counseling from? IMH? It's very common to be repulsive of counseling, neither can anyone expect counseling to work wonders in few sessions not to mention just one. If u feel it was good progress, that is how u feel. She must have other reason(s) to not pursue further. See if u can find out why. 

Moving out, getting married, enduring the abuse etc.... These might just be diverting the problem, rather than addressing it directly. Of course easier said than done, I feel a qualified counselor will help her and perhaps also yourself to see the whole thing clearer. We all need to understand ourselves better, before we know what's best for us. Right now, both of you might just know what she hates or doesn't want. The reverse might not be trivial. All the best, OP & gf."
ctbqacn,damnsadnewman,"well, ask your gf to decide to build the r/s or ignore the mom, ask her  to flip a coin, each side represent the ideas. when the coin landed, don't peek, ask her what she wants.

she tell you, ask her is that what she really really want in her heart.

after she tell you, then you guys work on it. dont have to check the coin lah, its just a physiological trick in revealing a person deepest feelings.

in anyways, don't break family ties. it is darn important, don't go listening to some shit telling you must disown the parent etc cause these shit did not disown their family.

anything can work on it, it is just time.

and for the above where your gf brought folks back, if im a dad, i would ask too. I would want my kid to have the correct influence ""by default"" since i dont know the friends well enough as i do not have time etc.

sarcastic as they would, it may because it's their character, they are like this since day 1. it is with them, you hardly able to change them as they grew up like this or with this kind of mindset, all you can do is to minimize the fights. sooner or later they will feel the difference and slowly you guys go into their heart and they will know.

my sister managed to do it, i think your gf can too. my sister attempted suicide multiple time be it really mom fault or her fault. she just want to vent from something.

i brought her to see doctor for her mental health. she is recovering. dont let your gf go into what my sister state is, do what you can now to help her, release her pented up anger, see a doctor if she cannot do it. it mean she need help from expert."

d2dsp6i,Hope83,"While I congratulate OP on your recovery, as someone whom I myself have been through depression and recovered so many years ago through also very unconventional means, I find the plan B suggestion being well-intended and I applaud his goodwill but nonetheless find it very ill-advised. 

OP is under the impression that the medication and therapy had totally no effect, and it was his subsequent decision to force himself to ""wake up"" and get his act together that kickstart his recovery from depression, pointing out that if the person could just find a way to find a fresh start, things will be different.

This is no different from the very ill-conceived lines mental illness sufferers have to hear from their friends and family that says ""cheer up, things will get better"", ""get your act together"", and ""you just need to get a hobby/get more sunshine in your life"" or ""be more positive"". This self-motivation crap goes into the same dustbin as ""If I can do it, so can you"" and shows a lack of empathy for those who are regularly having suicidal thoughts and having no sense of hope in their life. 

Correlation does not imply causation.

Back then I stopped treatment rather early due to the same belief that the treatment had no effect. My own recovery was more than a year after I cease my own treatment, but years later, as much as I would like to think that my recovery was due to luck, my own efforts, or a grand twist of fate or whatsoever, I cannot ignore the possibility that maybe the treatment did have a delay effect in ways I do not realize. 

In my past experience of being there for other depression sufferers, as well as hearing from those who recovered from depression, the latter group has always shown that there is a ""long"" lull period before they recover regardless of whether they are still receiving treatment or have ceased it on their own before they ""recover"". 

During that phase, they each have to continue with life before they eventually recovered. Nearly all attribute it to some reason such as a decision to not give up, to religion, or whatever.

Someone else I knew who recovered from depression could start a similar post and said she found religion in their life and that's how she recovered after ceasing treatment.

But that isn't right. It shows a lack of understanding of how depression really works and how the recovery process works. 

As much as OP has good intentions, my experience of being there for others with mental illnesses tells me that this will be poorly misconceived by many people. There will end up having people who out of a lack of understanding and patience use this post by OP to point out to their depressed friends or family members to just get a fresh start thinking that depression can be cured that way.
"
d2duh9c,,"> There, I was prescribed medication and skipped classes to attend therapy sessions but neither were effective. I became so lethargic that I could hardly get up from bed and couldn't study at all. I had no choice but to stop treatment and focus on my improving my poor grades.

How many combination of drugs did you try? Because if you tried just one and gave up, it doesn't mean that medication didn't work. Psychotic drugs react differently with different people and there are different combinations that doctors prescribe until you find the right one. Just because yours didn't work doesn't mean it won't work for the rest.

So you just stopped treatment and decided to focus on your study and it worked? You're considered lucky since you can just pull it together. Some people just can't. Period. They can't just ""find a fresh start"". Depression comes down to the chemical molecules inside you and also a little of emotional encouragement. Drugs and psychological counselling help with that. 

I hope people who needs real help reads this with a grain of salt.

I think most teenagers don't know patience and being content. Everyone wants to do everything while they are young, that's commendable, but if you look at the life ahead, your foundation time is quite crucial in determining your later life.

imposing ""Asian values"".

but of cos i can't generalise it to ""asian values"" as even countries which are more liberal have suicide cases. but pressures for within and without family does have a factor in driving suicidal thoughts.

cqdafe5,polyetheneman,"well, my psych teacher told us that men are more likely to succeed in committing suicide, and women are more likely to attempt to commit suicide. cos men go for more ""violent"" ways, eg jumping or hanging, and women do like overdose and cutting etc, which is less likely to kill you. 

my paramedic friend told me that it's not true that they handcuff corpses, and that its a crime because they need to get the police to come down, and they won't come if there's no crime right? or something like that.. although someone I know attempted suicide and its on her police record now.

Nailed it. Men attempt suicide less yet succeed more at doing it than women. Probably because when being made to 'suffer in silence', there's no one there to intervene when they're doing the suicidal act making it more probable that they will succeed in killing themselves. "
cqc11bf,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,"Do we have any statistics on the method with which suicide is attempted? I've seen a lot of girls with scars on their wrists from cuts, but they are always the wrong way (it should be down the road, not across the street), but never seen guys with them.

I think this is definitely a factor. They're made to put on a 'face' to show that everything is all hunky dory on the outside but in the inside, they're secretly dying. That's why you see many youths turn to gangs, drugs and other subcultures because they're looking for an identity, meaning, purpose and most of all, some contentment/happiness that to know there is more to life than the shitty situation he was in before.

cqcy6rc,chococrunchbar,"If I'm not wrong, women and men also tend to differ in how they attempt suicide. Women are more likely to use methods such as overdosing whereas men tend to use more violent methods.

cqchg9o,Hope83,"As someone whom have helped others often through their suicidal thoughts in the past, let me share what's the clearest distinction between the two.

Suicide or suicide attempt is an effort to end/get rid of the pain that has become too overwhelming for them to cope.

Self-harm is an effort to FEEL the pain. They cut themselves so that they can feel the physical pain, either because the emotional pain is too overwhelming for them or too numb for them to feel, thus the physical pain and seeing the blood is actually an outlet."
cqc5lp4,j_fat_snorlax,"When you self harm, you don't always want to kill yourself. That's why the cuts tend to be shallow and numerous, and in the wrong places. I won't comment on why people self harm though, I don't know enough.

When you attempt suicide though, you are actually trying to kill yourself. You choose larger veins/blood vessels to cut open, you jump off a suitably high building, you hang yourself by kicking over a chair so you have nothing to prop yourself up with, etc.

Some types of self harm can be fatal, some types of suicide don't work (that's why they're attempted suicide). The difference is in the intent I think."

cl3uns8,,"Hi,

  I'm not qualified to tell you that everything will get better. Maybe, maybe not. I also can't claim to know what you're going through. All I can do is tell you my experience, like many other of our brothers here. It is a unique experience, that only a handful of our singaporean sisters and foreign settlers can exchange with others.

Many of us older gents will probably cry foul, since most of us will have served 2.5 years, some even more =) but the time doesn't really matter. We all go through good times and bad times. some more than others. Most of us would have had a thunderflash in our tent at some stage. Stood in a parade square for hours and hours. Rejoice at the Cat 1 alarms. Most of us will now talk about how we had to train our chin-ups every day, and express our hatred of the legendary SBJ. 

Many of our dreams were destroyed, abandoned. Dreams of travel, or passionate endeavours. And when that happened, there was simply a void, filled only by days of hentak kaki.

I also clung on emotionally to a girl. She moved on as well. That hurt a lot, but what the service does is desynchronizes our journeys. But hey, on the bright side, I got to pick up one of them 18 year olds in a couple of years (and nowadays, I stay far far away from them =) ). 

Almost everyone of us, I'm sure, have thought ""hmm... I wonder how hard it would be to swim from Tekong to Singapore"". Hide under the jetty, and hitch a ride on the ferry, perhaps =). Honestly, I too wondered how I would get through it all. I also spent many days going through suicidal ideation. Some colleagues would try to get me to go to their church though I declined. I also didn't have such a large support group either as I wasn't too great at making friends (go figure). 

Eventually, though, I got out, as you will, but it is never over. I still can't look back fondly on those years. I still get nightmares. I went for therapy for a few months. I still struggle with the ideation. Things are better for me nowadays, but things could spiral out of control at any point. But at least I feel like I know what keeps me going currently: 

It's the realisation that *everyone is suffering*. 

They will not show it. They dare not, and cannot show it. To show weakness is to be inferior to others. To show sadness is to burden the ones close to them. They put on fake masks that brings joy and smiles to everyone, but struggle inside day by day. And when it gets too much, they act as a child reaching out for help; tantrums are thrown, tears are shed, throats are torned from screaming. Even the people that we look up to the most will find themselves in lost situations, and it is at that point that we realise our parents are also children.

I can't guarantee you that things will get better. But what I can tell you is that **you're not alone**. This isn't a ""hey, think about all these starving kids in Africa"" attempt. I'm not trying to belittle the issues that are close to your heart. What I'm saying is struggling is what gives meaning to our lives and makes us who we are in the future. And while everyone out there might seem to be coping just fine, they may simply be much better at hiding their feelings[1].

It may be hard, but look to the future, of which there is a long way ahead. There will be more obstacles in your way, and you will have to find ways around them. The top of the mountain is all the more satisfying the higher it is.

One day, pass on your experience to the ones who walk behind you.

cl5o9a7,brokeins,"While I can't give you any professional advice, I can say that I've been in your shoes.

When I when in army it felt like time stood still, the world in camp never changed, same old thing day in day out, doing the most meaningless things. I got very upset thinking that life out in the world was passing me by. 

On Sundays I would feel physically ill from the thought of having to book in at night. I don't think that I was depressed.. but I definitely felt caged and unhappy with life. For awhile I was very upset with my stay-in situation.

I would like to say that it got better for me, but it didn't. Things certainly looked up closer to my ORD date but otherwise I wasn't happy for the most of it. 

However looking back now, my biggest regret is that I didn't make more out of that 2 years. I have seen army mates who have become the best of pals, others who have been super garang in army convert that attitude to life now and are excelling in their fields. 

But for me? I don't have a single friend that was made in army. My bunk mates regularly meet-up and hang out and each others' houses but I am never called. 

I could have spent that 2 years picking up a skill but instead I chose to mope and be sad about it. If I could do it differently I would have been a more productive member of the army. 

This is a very rare time in life that you can completely try anything and fuck it up somehow and know that you'll still have a job, something to do, something to live for the very next day.

You can pick up a skill to practice in camp, make more friends, be a dick to people for fun, run more, get gold, get ripped, eat more, watch videos, anything! The army doesn't expect you to be smart at anything, just do the bare minimum and the army will love you. In no other circumstance you can find this kind of life.

What I would have done differently then is to do something that will have benefited me today, you think life is difficult? Wait till you ORD and you face the cage of Singaporean life. 

Not so sure if this will help, but if you need to talk you can PM me!"

All I can say is, look for the bright spots. I once got 2 days off simply for helping out at an event in camp which merely required me to take props off the stage. Other than that, I was wolfing down lamb chops, tacos, ramen and kebab.

Another time during guard duty, we basically went all ""fuck it"". On my final duty, I drew my rounds (was doing prowler), brought my stuff up to the guardroom bunk, and slept my two hours away. 

My advice is to not think about, and live one day at a time. look forward to lunch, then to dinner, then to bed. Time kind of solves itself if you are willing to face the other way. "

NS can make people feel trapped yes. But to the extent of what you feel, that generally shows you are suffering from/triggering your anxiety disorder.

You already said that life in camp isn't really that tough, but it's the trapped feeling you can't handle. But do you think working life next time will be vastly different?

Every choice has a price. If you think you can't take it, then go and see professional help and get yourself downgrade to a Pes F.  What about possible future being ruined? Well, every choice has a price as I already said. You just have to choose which type of hardship is more bearable to you.

cl4onps,positividadsport,"Can I ask why don't you seek some professional advice? Something is blocking you? You seem to have the idea that once you get connected to medical services you are doomed to a life of abnormal-ness based on what you observe of people who get connected. But the fact is seeking medical services in itself does not equal = life going down. That's because people who *didn't* seek help and destroyed their lives is not as **publicly noticeable** as those who *did* seek help and destroyed their lives (that's the danger of going undetected, unnoticed - you never know what happens to those who slip under the radar. You could disappear and no one has a very good clue why). In fact not seeking help could be far worse, because you are in denial (extremely true of people too tired to make sense of things, speaking from personal experience and research), and you have to cure yourself (a little problematic isn't it?).

Edit: Oh I just thought of an example. 2 wives, Wives A and B, suffer from abuse from their husbands. Wife A chooses to hide it from the world and continue getting abused because seeking help ""means I have a problem"" (which is wtf?! so if you don't seek help, the problem never existed, and the abuse was an imaginary ghost?). Wife B reveals it to the police, and even though there was short-term pain from getting separated from a husband 'she loved', in the end she regained proper freedom. Go figure OP! You can do it. Seeking help doesn't mean you get hospitalised, it could be as simple as talking to a confidential counsellor every 3 weeks and letting all the tension evaporate slowly.... into the air... isn't it nice..."

It is really sian to everyday do the same thing over and over and getting yelled at by the officers and etc, but you gotta look at this from a different perspective. Army life is pretty fun, doing the same thing day after day without a care in the world. You don't have to care about grades (maybe somewhat?) You are practically shut off from the world, just you and your squadmates, going through shit together. No one is better than anyone inside army, the purpose of army is just to show you the ropes, make you operationally ready NS men and to establish a bond between squadmates. It will be eventually but until then just pull through. Now you say you hate the army life, but I guarantee you, once you POP out, you will somewhat miss it further down the road. I hated NPCC to the core, but now looking back, despite all the physical training and getting yelled at by the officers for doing a mistake, I kinda liked it.

I dont mean to sound patronising, but you simply cannot compare uniformed groups to the 'real' thing. I was in a uniformed group too, but it was a while back. I stayed back after school for a few hours, like others with CCAs, did my shit, and went home.

You always walk out of the school gate at the end (or out of ubin, wherever you do your camps), no matter how much you sweat. But when you're stuck in a barracks, whether you get your meagre 2 days in civilization depends on whether your superiors want to fuck with you.

Identifying the feelings, realising the source of said feelings will enable one to take actual steps to take action on them.

cym4wsm,dashrandom,"Hey, sorry to hear all this has happened to you. 

Also, I don't mean to sound condescending or anything but calm down. You're asking for advice on the Internet but before we can help you, we need to understand what you need help with. Your post had the background info and request for help so jumbled together, I'm not sure where to begin. 

Have you talked to your counsellor about your problems with going to school? Why are you approaching reddit instead of your counsellor to discuss these problems? We're not professional trained, perhaps speaking to your counsellor, especially if you're looking for advice or solutions, may be a better option. 

We can lend a listening ear here but do be forwarned this is the Internet. It's not a safe space and while you will meet many people who are supportive of what you're going through, you're going to meet people who will ridicule you just because they get a kick out of it.

Lastly, please don't think you're letting anyone down. I would say right now your priorities should be our health first, and your studies second. It's going to be quite difficult to work through both problems at once, so try tackling one after the other alright? "

crkeows,blahhh87,"I am probably going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but what the heck.  Let me give you my impression of you  solely on your post.  You gave me the impression of the mamat who has high aspiration, but often look for the easy way out, doesn't really practice critical thinking much and generally an underachiever.  Looks like someone preferred bro'ing around in the gym, rather then hitting his 6Ps and pre-readings hmm?

If I am wrong, I apologise. If I am right...

Don't sign on if you are that person I think you are.  No comment for NSFs in SPF, but generally friends working as regulars in the police force, they are practically married to the job.  Brb 12 hours shift (and more) a day, being called back on off days and just too tired to do anything else.  Sure like any other jobs, you can find a way to ""lepak"", but you will just be miserable that way and it will just make you think of breaking bond. Yes, SPF does award sponsorships for officers to get a degree (the HALO award), but that is usually given to a small handful of people - officers who are hardworking and pretty much excellent officers (btw, SPF would rather keep you a PO then a SO; they need more POs then they do SOs).  Does a person who prefer ""lepak work"" fit the bill of a HALO award recipient?

I am guessing that your friends has alot to say about the  ""matreps"" in CD as well?  I can say that majority of them comes from difficult background, only secondary school educated and aren't so lucky in life.  So yeah, of course they are going to be envious of you rising above them, just because you have a diploma.  But so what?  Learn to be friends with them, learn that there are things you can learn from them and that they can learn from you. Heck, encourage them to get into ITE after ORD, you have high chances of becoming a specialist in CD, so use your higher status to help them improve.  I find that those dudes despite their tear-drop tattoo and that dot on the forehead, tend to be quite loyal friends once you have gained their trust.  So instead of trying to avoid them, treat them fairly and you will do fine in your 2 years in CD.

My advice.. proceed your NS in CD dude.  Meanwhile, pick up some important life skills like critical thinking, work ethics, time management and social skills while you are in there.  Work hard and don't slack, you will gain things that will be useful to you for life.  Get some new perspective and mature a little bit more then I think you would be ready to think about signing on.

PS - Aku pon melayu, bro. Pape picit ah.. err.. I mean PM lol. "
crkd01l,swifterrr,"Hi there. Let's talk about your decision to sign on.

First you have to ask yourself some questions and perform your own cost benefit analysis.

What's the cost of going to the SPF over serving your 2 years of NS in CD and working outside / getting a degree?

What's the cost of NOT going to the SPF? Will you be able to afford to finance a degree on your own? Do you need the 30k lump sum to jumpstart your 'career'?

Are you willing to pay that opportunity cost, the next best opportunity forgone?

Basically, what's your best alternative to a negotiated agreement / next best option? Would you be happy in that alternative?

Which schemes would you sign on for if offered? Have you prepared for the interview and trained hard? (not just in check, I mean IPPT gold, reliably.)

Would you be disappointed if you were not offered a scholarship / sponsorship for a degree after your service?

Would you dedicate yourself fully to the service (i.e were you always very interesting in joining the police force, can you contribute to the organization in a significant, meaningful way. This benefits both you and the organization as greater contribution leads to a faster career track, of course)

If you can't readily answer all these questions, I would say you're not ready to sign on. Do think about it carefully, it's a long term decision. Best of luck! :)"
crl9red,kyith,"I dunno how this will work out but i felt like i can contribute to give you a point of view from a person turning 35 year old this year looking back:

1. You are not going to know much about what you want at 22 years old. I don't know what i want at 21 years old as well. I took IT because I was so ignorant about adult work life that I choose something I knew to do: something to do with computers. It was kind of the wrong choice looking back. Its perfectly normal not knowing where the road leads you. I am sure many of the folks here are in that position.

2. You are feeling like you have to make the most important decision of your life. If you make the wrong move you are screwed. That's because up to this point you do not have to make so much decisions in life. There is a way to switch. Its important to make sound decisions, with good data and knowledge but if you fail, realize it early and pivot. I have seen folks realizing that after 1 or 2 years in their trained vocation that doesn't 'suit' them, and pivot. Let me share with you something: even at age 35, I don't see myself in this job for the next 20 years, and I dunno what to do. I think this is normal. What is important is whether you have that **second level skills** to find out how to pivot in life

3. Signing on for some people can be a long time, and for a lot that I observed can be a 5 to 10 year decision. When you are in there, there is this toxic culture at some places that tells you there is no future in there and you have to get out. For 7-8 years of my work, I worked with SAF regulars and NSFs, and I have seen folks that believe in their work, and the disillusioned ones.

4. You are afraid that you would be badly influenced. The problem is that you perhaps don't trust yourself. Environment factors influence a person very much. I was able to study well because my secondary school friends were conducive, but i can see a situation that I can turned out badly. If you anticipate that, surround yourself with a good environment! Learn to be selective about your environment!

5. I don't like my job. Haven't been since I graduated and work for 11 years. That doesn't mean it will suck. What matters in ANY job is that you BUILD UP COMPETENCY. If you become so good at something, it becomes easy for you. It suck less. You may learn to love it. You don't need passion at work. You need to be real good at it.

6. You talked about migrating but need to ensure your family is taken care of. Someone mentioned that the civil sector pays better for those that are less academically qualified. I agree. You mentioned contrasting thought about that $30,000. If you ask me at 35 is $30,000 a big deal, I would say... yes it is still a big deal for me. When I talked about **second level skills**, these are modules in Life University that you need to master, that is needed till you die. Wealth Management is one of these modules. If you failed this module you are f&*ked. Wealth Management is simple but not easy.Recently I shared [**some advice learn in my 20s for folks who are on the path of financial independence**](http://www.investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/my-advice-to-the-20-something-on-the-path-to-financial-independence/) this might be useful for you. You might also wanna check out [my generic formula that I use to build my wealth](http://www.investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/my-best-friend-asked-me-how-to-become-wealthy-this-is-what-i-told-him/). if you read through the 2 guides, you will realize how freaking important that $30,000 can be and not getting into debt.

7. When I was at reservist in the airforce, i saw a very detrimental culture there where the regulars make use of their pay to study a 4 year degree course part time and then quit.I say detrimental for the air force, but think about it, you don't need a sponsorship.Treat the few years as a way to get a degree WITHOUT going into debt. To be able to afford university is a matter of how flexible your brain is in coming up with solutions. [read this](http://www.investmentmoats.com/budgeting/getting-your-child-to-pay-for-their-own-university-fees/)

8. you think you hit rock bottom because you think 22 years old is very old. what about folks like us at 35. I wouldn't even dare to say i have seen everything. How you view life experience is [like this graph here](http://i.imgur.com/U5pZT0a.jpg)

9. Take inspiration from [this millionaire base ball pitcher who lives in a 1977 van](http://www.investmentmoats.com/financial-independence/the-millionaire-baseball-pitcher-who-lives-in-a-1978-beat-up-van/). Do u have a philosophy of life that sees what is important, what is not and be able to choose?"
crkdace,knnbccb,"1. You will not get to choose your vocation. Once you sign on, where you are assigned to is beyond your control

2. Seriously, are you asking what are the major differences in police force and another entity that does firefighting and emergency civil/life-saving services?

3. Life advice is.. how you do anything is how you do everything.. It's easy to look back and say that you could have done better in another diploma course but, as you mentioned, your preference is to lepak and that pretty sums up the impression that you give. 

On hindsight, are you sure you can put in enough effort to excel in that programme and seeing that you did not put in effort in your IT course? How about just make sure you complete your diploma and sign on to police and just make sure that you work hard. Take care of this and the rest will take care of itself. "
crkf2kp,hannorx,"Everyone else has given you solid advice and I shall not add further other than this. You need to change your mindset about having preference for work that is 'lepak'. If you want to succeed, you cannot choose the easiest way out.

Even though the mindset of some is that regulars do nothing but slack and lim kopi at the canteen, I can tell you that it's not. The higher ups, especially those that actually approve promotions, are actually educated folk, they don't anyhow give promotions. If you are wayang or good, you can rise. If you are fucked up, you will always be fucked up unless you change.

crl454m,sgreanscdf,"your future lies in your own hand.
if you want to lepak... then see 10 yrs down the road, you will still behave like this.

they say when a person grew older, is wiser, its not always the case. open your eye and look around how many relax 1 corner folk around? too many.

so what you think about your attitude toward life? it mold your worklife too. perhaps the same reason why you hated IT internship.

its fine to look for fast solution, there is nothing wrong with it. however, doing a good job and fast solution is the key.

many folks think they are smart and gave a crap job. that is skiving. 

90% fall in that kind of situation, if you see yourself always giving excuses, want easy way, everything is bad to you etc. you belong here.

if you are positive, things can change, thing can excel, thing can do better, you can do more. then you belong to the smart work attitude.

so.. be it SPF or SCDF, both are the same when you kana targeted. 

but please don't join SCDF if you are the lazy, easy way out and give crap job kind. because life at stake. be kind to humans. go be a PO, do neighbourhood cases at least not that critical. if critical and you did not do properly, serve you right confirm kana hammer by top.

this is my super blunt advise. take it as a man or wiggle yourself out and be the 90%."
crl4omm,imatalkingllama,"As a person in the events management industry, I'd say don't sign on. You don't sound ready and since you have an interest in events management, why not pursue it?

Join any event company, gain experience and work your way up. We may meet some day.

crl4x7g,prfnts,"I'm currently serving under CD as NS SC. I really enjoy my life right now, but ORD in like 2 weeks. It really depends, police is a lot more slack compared to CD. I was honestly shocked at the level of effort that has to be put into this line of work. If you are looking to sign on, probably look at SPF, cause CD is a vocation where you have to stay fit all the time.
PM me if you want more details."
crl5sh3,Classifyd,"i'm not really qualified to answer but when has that ever stopped me from giving an opinion, so here goes:

you feel like you hit rock-bottom, take a breather before deciding.

Uniformed services means regimentation: you **must** be able to conform and follow the rules if you want to 'make it'. 

I think that's the baseline if anyone asked me. You must be able to meet that requirement at the minimum.

Then there's passion and drive. If you just want to slack there's actually lots of people in uniformed services that don't really like the work they do; but if you have such an attitude it's not gonna help in whatever job you do lol srsly.

all regulars have to do some form of shiftwork at the beginning. office hours/desk jobs only come later.

usually advancement requires doing frontline shit at the beginning.

imo the most worth it vocation is NPCO, provided you have the right attitude (passion, drive, service, integrity). The work gives you a lot of real experience, and that's where you begin to accumulate detective (nowadays IO) experience. That to me is the most police of police work and the most rewarding/challenging. It also has the added benefit of being just a little bit more useful even when you don't necessarily have that same level of physical fitness. [e.g. private investigators, criminal defence work].

on the other hand there's lots of other departments and units in SPF. Maybe PCG might suit you. Once you're au fait with the technical skills I heard it's pretty much sit in boat/cutter the whole shift, of course keeping watch etc etc I can't go into more details without being unfair to its image but you can ask around.

Also, shift work is shift work, that's how it is. You will get tired/sleepy but hey your team mates will as well. People are human.

If you look around the market, gahmen uniformed services pay pretty well for non-degree holders in general  - and has structured advancement prospects and training. I mean unless you feel like doing something with you diploma in the private sector (which you say you don't) it can be considered.

As for sponsorship thing I've heard people signing on with O levels getting sponsored for their diploma all the way to degree. 

Lastly, adopt a positive attitude; because SPF (or CD) involve serious work so they wouldn't want half-hearted people. don't hang around too much with negative people that put you down."

crmkxqg,sjioldboy,"You won't pass the SPF interview anyway if you mention all the excuses in your post to them.

My advice is also the same: serve NS first, mature a bit, & pick up some life skills along the way. You'll need them to adjust to the realities of working life later on, regimentation or not.

Don't give up your diploma too. Many tertiary grads don't work in the same field they study for. But having the paper qualification entitles you to a better basic pay grade than otherwise.

If you meant a more ""senang"" or ""mudah"" career (instead of ""lepak"") in the uniformed services, take a look at their MSO/MSS support staff jobs which are office-based & organized like their counterparts in the civil service. Auxiliary police like CISCO/AETOS are also less physically demanding, except for the shift hours."

crl0qoh,syamilnaufal,"No reply that has the truth will be downvoted in my thread, I guess?

1. For your first paragraph, you're partly right bro. I was doing well in Y1, but hit rock-bottom when I realize I'm struggling really hard with coding in Y2. I attended UT clinics...read coding books in the library, did W3schools.com practises.. asked those who are better than me to teach me and gave me tips and shortcuts. It's still the same man. Coding requires years of practise, and with me jumping from Business school to IT, it really is a culture shock for me. I guess it's something I'm not meant to do.

About second paragraph, you have nothing but the truth. Yes, I'm confused now with what I want to do after NS, but I'm not lying with what I meant by ""lepak"". I should've used a more better word, but nah, I don't regret it. The replies are good.

Regarding the third, it's not about the ""matreps"". I used to be in a ""matrep"" school. Changkat Changi. I know how they roll. My friends are more worried about the stuff going in CD. They say drug abuse and illegal stuff like that are common inside. Which I find to be...half-truth? Because how can it be inside a government organization things like that could be so rampant? I have to see for myself for it to be true.

.2 - great; no malice in my question.. and thanks for taking it non-negatively.

.3 I understand on the amount of effort put in and not translating to beyond Ds/Fs. Sorry if my statement was a bit high-handed.. Perhaps it's an issue of learning how to learn.. It sounds like you are putting in the hours but are not getting the result. Try to change how you learn, get help, focus on measuring how you can improve. Get a mentor, speak to other people in the industry.. get inspired. Find what makes you motivated to go out and do whatever it is you wanted to do.. 

The most important thing is to just keep on doing it and set achievable goals. Put in the hours and spend time on the grunt honest, work whatever that is. some people find their purpose later in life.. nothing wrong with not  knowing what to do at 22.. but the most important thing is that you know you have time at your side and less liabilities (family, finances, etc).

Singapore is not the only option... think about what you can do after NS. Go to Germany and pick a tradecraft apprenticeship, or go to somewhere new and explore.

cw3tee4,pkismeyea,try going to a dermatologist.
cw3tega,loonylovegood,Hi hi OP. Fyi your skin condition will require either of the following treatments to have a guaranteed positive result: chemical peels or laser treatment. Please don't be intrigued by beauty salons that don't offer either of the two. I would save more money and spend on actual effective treatment instead. Try Freia Medical. Dr Ma is a meticulous doctor. 
cw3wys9,ceddya,"No, don't get facials from cosmeticians. It can make things much worse if you have sensitivity to the ingredients used.

I would suggest seeing a dermatologist. Your acne scars can be treated via things like chemical peels, laser resurfacing or microdermabrasion. Not only that, but the dermatologist can prescribe a Retinoid (or Isotretinoin if the acne is severe) or anbitiotics to help with your acne issues.

The cheapest route is probably to get a referral to the NSC. The other option is to go to clinics like Maple that feature rather good medical skin care. While that can be more expensive, it's a good compromise between going the private route while not needing to pay the really high prices associated with derms from the private hospitals."

This is really horrible and disgusting, and I respect you for holding on for so long. My advice is to go seek a counselor. Preferably a school counselor, because they usually have a direct line of contact to higher-ups in the school. Be honest with them, and don't feel bad about oversharing.  Meanwhile, please don't do anything to end your misery. If you need anyone to talk to, feel free to talk to anyone on here, about anything you want. If you really are intending on changing schools, I'd also suggest seeing if you can change to one where you have a friend you can trust."

Primary school kids are all very immature, I'm sure they would have grown up to be a little remorseful of their past actions, but forgive and forget okay? It's a chapter of your life that I'm not saying you should totally forget that it happened, but what's done is done. No point continually being poisoned by it while those who actually did the poisoning forgot that they had done it.

That was only when I told myself I needed professional help. And I believe that I would have been better off if I had sought help earlier. 

"
e6fhgqu,entropyboi,"If this is the school that is next to the Shell station, and in the west near a certain mall, I have attended it. To be honest, it did scar me mentally and emotionally.

I believe there are still some good teachers left, but many of them left due to inner politics and some cases of ""corruption"". The sadism of the teachers is observable, and I am often under the impression that these teachers think very highly of themselves. Especially the teachers in charge of the student council.

Things are only going to get tougher because it is an IP school, you still have many years to go. Transferring is a tedious process, so I do not exactly encourage it unless it is a last resort.

Here are some advices I could give you. There are a few ways to go about this:

1) Get really good grades(start studying like hell)
One thing I observed in the school is that the teachers are rather biased against students who perform poorly. They treat them like deviances. While some teachers do extent help, their impression of you is quite different from that of top scorers. 

To beat the system, first conquer it. Follow the rules, don't be late for school etc. Try to fit in first.

Once you are not mark as a deliquent (by deliquent I mean doing poorly in test), it will give you more free realm in the school

2) Think critically, and learn to not give a shit.
The student council, in retrospect, are really puppets of the teachers. And the teachers have certain ideology of their own that are not representative of the student population.

I realise only after graduation that many of the ideas the student council, in essence the teachers, are trying to implement is rather...full of shit. 

There is no other way to go about it.

There is a time when they did sexual education, and they labelled the whole male student population as ""sexual predators"". I'm not kidding, they were blatantly exhibiting sexism and advocating nazi-feminism in their speech.

There was also a toxic level of emphasis on leadership, as if it was the only quality that matters. They organised leadership camps that repeats the same formula every time, as well as all-boys-camp that felt like BMT. During these all-boys camps, we have to call our teachers 'sir', treating them as officers.

I have seen really smart students buying into their ideology. They were acting out of character during these camps, kinda like those Youth leaders during Nazi era or Mao.

Leadership is something cultivated over time for many people, it is not something forced out of you after a three-day camp.

That's why it is vital to always think for yourself and analyse the school's policies critically. Know your priorities, understand what really matters, and learn to filter these excessive noises. Don't mindlessly follow the crowd, but also don't stand out too much.

Most importantly, learn to not give a fuck.
It's not going to be easy. 

3) You are responsible for everything that happens to you.

This is a ideal that I believe, if taken the right way, empowers you to change your life. 

It's true, none of the terrible things that happened to you is your fault. They are terrible things, terrible people, terrible circumstances...fuck them. It's not your fault.

However, the problems in your life doesn't go away by shifting the blame. Removing yourself from the equation is only delaying the issues. Indeed, these terrible events is not your fault, but how you choose to deal with them is your responsibility. You are not a victim, you are just someone with terrible luck. A person can choose to live in depression for his dead child, or move on with his life. He has his responsibility to the people who cares about him, and most importantly his responsibility to his own life. Nothing takes that responsibility away from him.

It might be delusional, but never underestimate the power one obtains from facing his responsibility. ""With great responsibility comes great power"". Understand that these issues you are facing are not permanent, and you are stronger than your problems. You have the choice, and responsibility, to handle your life. You are in charge of your life. You are stronger than your problems, and you can deal with  them in your own way. Not by blowing up the school of course. I know you want to.

Things will get better. Or worse. But you are responsible for whatever that happens. You are in charge, you are not powerless.

Things do get better for me after graduation, I hope it does for you too.

I wish you all the best in that certain school."
e6fp0da,ILoveTreasureHunter,"Hang in there! My mother once told me this, “why let the people that you don’t like, that don’t care about you, determine what happens in your life? Why let these people, who will disappear after 1-2 years, affect your grades and achievements, things that will stay with you for life? Why let them exert such a strong influence on you, or do you want to reserve that place for people that you are closer to?”

I’ve had bad experiences in primary school as well, due to my sometimes extreme views and bold nature. There were teachers that physically abused students for getting their math problems wrong, teachers that singles out students (myself included) for shaming, teachers that yelled at me and threw my submitted work onto the ground, classmates that called me names, ignored and ostracised me. 

I worked silently myself, and thought “who are they to judge me?” I obtained multiple awards in various academic contests and olympiads then, and DSA’d into a good school. 

> Your method is shit!

Well this one solved me multiple questions and won me an award. You can have fun with the shitty method taught by the teacher.

> Ya la ya la you're so smart right? Go away lah, smart kid!""

Ok, have fun with your TYS, I’m going back to RuneScape. I already have a confirmed place in a good secondary school.

In the end, I got a 265 for the PSLE, and was ranked #4 in school. Ranks 1-3 were pretty nice people that i was on decent terms with, so theres no salt about that. 

In secondary school and JC, one thing I’ve learnt is that demerit points generally dont mean shit. The highest scoring students in my class skipped 90% of lectures and are frequent late comers, much to the ire of the teachers. Just don’t do any stupid shit that gets you suspended or expelled. The main goal in an IP school is to do well enough to get into a university course of your choice, and maybe get a scholarship if you want. When it comes to those, no one will care about that time you got a demerit point for doodling, or the time you were late for class (or didn’t show up at all!) unless it was a serious disciplinary record that schools are forced to disclose. 

> “Helping her to revise? Don't bullshit me! You always try to be different and it makes me very irritated. Do you really think you have the choice to do what you want? Stop making the teachers pissed off, I'm telling you.""

Well you actually do, the the first choice you need to make is to ignore toxic teachers like these, and it isn’t “just” ignore them. You need to know that toxic people like this teacher and your bullies in primary school are actively causing harm to you, and you need to cut off any emotional ties ASAP. From what I’ve seen among my peers from primary school to JC, the most accomplished ones always did things their own way. 

> And what the fuck was that about? What's wrong with being different? Oi, we are humans leh. We all have our views and perspectives and you, piece of shit, should learn to respect that shoudn't you? How the fuck are you able to know so much about me to be able to evaluate what's good and what's bad for me so confidently when you barely even know me? Go become a fortune teller lah.

Theres nothing wrong with being different. But unfortunately, many singaporeans have not learnt how to respect different views and perspectives yet. The Straits Times comments section shows this pretty well. This teacher seems to be one of them, so don’t place too much weight on his words. 

Stay strong, don’t let these people control your life. You will get through it!"
e6f9k6i,Irreleventusername2,"Not a certified counselor but I hope I can help you.
  
Been through the same situation before, you should definitely approach your school counselors, that's what they are there  for. Sometimes you hear about horrible school counselors but you won't know until you tried it right?  
  
My advice for you might sound cliche but you really have to stop looking at yourself as a victim.  
  
> Have fun with your mentally handicaped child.  

Thinking that you are mentally handicapped isn't gonna help the situation you are going through, try changing your attitude. You can't do anything about your situation (you can't transfer school, fire your teachers or beat up your classmates) so you have to learn to adapt and just (sadly) do what they ask you to do. Unfortunately, there isn't much room for special snowflakes in Singapore so just try to be normal.

> It's a vicious cycle ;)   
  
So as hard as it sounds, break it, snap it in half, who owns your life?  
If you need someone to talk to approach your counselors, I had good experience with them. You can also PM us that is fine.

TL;DR: You need to stop thinking of yourself as the victim, reach out for help if you need it!"

Then i managed to get back the card but the other 3 sided the girl even though they witness the whole situation. The teacher chose to believe and he said because it was 4 against 1. He was also a teacher known for being bias to girls. He also bragged a lot about him being a police officer last time before he started teaching.

You will have difficulties communicating with most people. However, you you will benefit is so many other ways. Making money is so much easier for people like us.  


2) Be strong. Speak when you feel like speaking, do what you want to do. Live the way you want to live. If people don't like you, so what? Be yourself fearlessly.  


3) Find your own people. There will probably be few people in your life that you can truly click with but they exist. Go and find them. We don't need many friends. Just a few good ones.  


4) Pursue knowledge and wisdom to improve your life. You have a good mind, use it.

e6fmdye,dubbuffet,"To be quite honest, I was a bit cynical about just how bad the teachers were in your story. A part of me, probably because I have some experience with education in general, said that surely at least one teacher around you is not absolutely dogshit, and that perhaps you are exaggerating a fair bit of the details or that there is a fair bit of confirmation bias on your part.

But then a part of me says ""What if he isnt?"" and so here I am trying to help and to listen and hopefully offer some perspective.

If you need a ear, and I know it is not quite the same because I am not your teacher; if you dont mind giving an educator a shot to help you where others may have let slip, drop me a PM. "

Jesus Christ that's just a male form of slut-shaming (I'm assuming you're male? Feel free to correct me). The girl who did that to you deserves no respect. 

Your SAP teachers appear to be really big assholes. Shaming you for helping classmates and verbally abusing you as a form of scolding? That's unwarranted behavior. 

Besides your Dad, do you have your Mom or Siblings to talk to? Or any classmates you currently have that you trust? Talking with someone can alleviate some of the bottled-up emotions you're having. With all the shit you and your classmates have to put up with, y'all deserve better. Something like this should not go unnoticed to the public eye.

A therapist might help you with your social anxiety problems. Due to the fact that you're stuttering it's definitely very severe. 

The only disagreement I have with your post is this part:

>> A woman dresses in a way that exposes lots of skin; a man finds her attractive and rapes her. In court, the woman is sentenced to jail because she was the one that caused the man to rape her.

> \^\^Obviously, this is immoral and wrong, right? Becaue it's the man's choice whether to rape her or not and he has full control over whether to do it or not.

> AND, just like how its 100% the man's choice whether to rape her or not, it is 100% my classmates' choice whether to get influenced by me or not. Why am I being blamed?

I don't honestly think you're a negative infleunce to your classmates. But those who are should be blamed as well. Stating that the negative-influenced are completely at fault is a form of victim-blaming. Negative influencers in the schools may have bad intentions; they encourage students to smoke or do drugs, get wrapped up in gang fights or distract them from their studies. Just as it is the man's fault to rape an innocent woman, so is the bad-influencer's fault for causing problems in the school. 

Other than that you have my sympathy. I hope you can get through this troubled stage of your life. "
e6gp13y,Jafart_,"From your writing it just appears that you have a severe protagonist complex and sense of entitlement.

Teachers very rarely threaten dp for the first time, meaning you're likely a repeat offender (of doodling in class) but why are you feeling victimised for this? You're the one at fault here.

""Stop making your teachers pissed off"" probably implies repeat behaviour even across classes. For that same anecdote, ever consider that given your past behaviour that the teacher is justified in thinking you aren't actually teaching her but doing smth else?

It could be your mum or a classmate, but just have someone close to you you feel comfortable confiding in. It’s not healthy to have all these feelings bundled up with a sense of helplessness, because you’re just going to get worse feeling like the world’s against you. Get a friend who can talk to you about it. Maybe he’ll say “just follow the teacher” but at least you know your sense of injustice is felt. It’s unfair sometimes, maybe lots of times, but you at least know you’re not ignored. Stay strong!"

There are petty people everywhere and in NS/school we have less control over the probability of having such people in positions of authority lording over us.

I don't have much to say about those except that many years down the road when you are working etc these experiences that may currently seem pretty traumatic to you will look pretty trivial in comparison to everything else will be experiencing in life.

Look past school life, broaden your horizons and focus on your goals and aspirations. High school is just a short phase and probably pretty irrelevant in the large scheme of things.  These bitter and petty people that are your teachers aren't even going to be pebbles on the road you are going to walk on just a few years from now. 

tldr: Once you have a better perspective and a reality to anchor your goals and aspirations to... it is much easier to look past these unjust and petty situations."
e6fh3yp,AizenSousuke92,"I felt like reading a different yet similar version of my school life pre-tertiary. 

My advice: 

1) Avoid those people that makes life difficult unless you have no choice - find people who ""click"" with you or just find some friends from upper or lower secondary(?) - much easier from my experience because they do not have that prejudice against you. 

2) Get results really well based on the different actions that you took apart from other students to make other students look up on you instead of looking down - for example, find a skill outside classroom lesson and use it to make studying simpler\more effective\innovative. "
e6fmcli,depressive-realism,"Hey I feel you man....Are u taking the o level system or ip system? If you are taking the o level system, I think u might have a chance to get a new start in jc after secondary school. Also, don't bottle it up. I didn't even dare to join in for PE lessons and would pretend to read a newspaper cause I felt ostracised. I really relate to how u feel, and I know how painful it is."
e6gzq1v,kylarblint024,"This reminds me of back in primary and secondary school, similar experiences although I never got good grades so more pressure from Le momma, anyway, I hated SG’s competitive nature and hated the fact that you don’t really have much of a say in what you want to do (unless you’re either Sibei good at it, even then it’s not worth unless you ‘aka your family or government’ are earning boatloads of $$$ or fame, e.g Olympic swimmer) 

Teachers don’t really give too much shits once they ascertain you’re either too useless or no potential, I had a Cher that literally yelled at me to give up pure bio in front of the whole class as I was doing terrible in that subject. She was yelling at the entire class for not doing well in general anyway so she was on a roll. Ironically, some of my classmates became teachers so idk if it was just me, I swore never to be like them.

Unfortunately that’s SG’s mentality tho, value through merit, you gotta prove you’re worth it or you’re trash. Either you suck it up and live with it or somehow find something you’re good at and make ppl pay you for it. 

Also unfortunately, I’m one of the lucky ones that got an overseas education, let me tell you, in my honest opinion, I like the less cut-throat atmosphere (I also felt more motivated to actually try harder) there. I know not many Singaporeans are able to ‘escape’ like I did but perhaps when you enter Uni (I have no doubts you’ll definitely make it), you can try to get an overseas exchange gig (will most likely have to either get scholarships [tough but you have to try], or work part time, or do what a friend of mine did and sign a government contract (I think it was 4 years?). I know, I know, why sign your life away? Well if you hate the system, you can have a number of options:

1) live with it and just whine about how bad it is (I do that often)

2) escape to another country that you’ve fallen in love with [in my case, I found my loved one here and I love the weather (not hot and humid)]

3) perhaps the best solution but also the toughest, Join the system and try to change it from the inside. You can either get out of a sinking ship or try to fix it and save the rest of the people onboard.

Either one is up to you, it’s your life after all. Just know that once you’re on your own, your world is your oyster (I never understood that saying). I’m just trying to say that your struggles are real but also temporary. There will always be another day, another struggle, but you’ll find, as you grow older that these issues take lesser priority in your life (I mean seriously, you’ll be more worried about your phone bill or something). 

Last but not least (I’m prob missing a lot of things and also I’m pretty naive in SG stuff, I haven’t been back in a while), go find some friends who have similar hobbies with you, reddit seems to be one way this can happen, join a club or something (I had tons of fun with classmates who played 40k *for the greater good!*)

Ehh, that’s my two cents? I know it’s not saying a lot as I’m lucky to have the means of going overseas but I honestly believe you can be happy after secondary school or school in general.

TL:DR, school sucks, but it’s temporary and these ppl will hardly be in your life again if you so choose. Just keep on living and eventually you’ll find yourself remembering these bad times as a fleeting memory.

Shitty people are everywhere, you will meet them even if you transfer school. You can't change everyone but you can change how you deal with them. "
e6h1kcb,junnies,"A lot of humans and teachers are idiots. My school had relatively decent teachers, but there were still a few bad ones which I had a few run-ins or poor experiences (nothing terrible).

But I think your real issue might not entirely be with the environment but with your own psychology. There are bullies everywhere in many schools, but they generally only attack those who they sense they can prey on. It seems like you have been traumatised, creating a sense of weakness and worthlessness in yourself that bad people exploit. I would say that the best thing for you is not necessarily to seek a school counseler, but to challenge your own self to be braver, to stand up for yourself, to confront the bullies and their behavior whether they are students or teachers. The counseler may not help, and a school transfer may lead to same problems. But if you gain courage, strength, and respect for yourself, you can deal with any people from any environment.

Looking back, I would have shown much less respect and attention to the bad teachers. If you think they are unreasonable, walk away or ignore them, and if/ when they try to escalate the matter, just explain what happened. You can even dare them to escalate the matter if you think you are in the right. Judging by the way you type, you are probably smarter and more sensible than a lot of the teachers, but psychologically you are used to being in a subordinate/ deferential role which they can see and exploit.

You don't have to please any of them and their unreasonable-ness. There was an episode in JC where a teacher asked for my name after catching me doing something unorthodox (not really wrong or mischievous) and I just ignored her request. Eventually, she tracked me down (she was teaching a class and some of her students knew me) and she acted as if she 'got me', but nothing happened since I didn't even do anything wrong. But this was after I had matured a bit during JC. If I had the same maturity in high school as I have now, I would have been a lot ruder and less deferential to the poor behavior displayed by teachers.

e6fjuxx,damstereiw1,"To add on:

This specific school forces students to take part in competitions so frequently that is doesn't seem like it's for the ""competition spirit"" anymore. It really seems like they only want the trophies and medals so as to give the school a better reputation and to give the general public a better impression of that school. Why? So that more students will register to go to that school and the school will make more $$$. So many foreign classmates have been tricked by this and entered the school this year, paying thousands upon thousands of dollars every month.

&#x200B;

If education is really the purpose of this school, then why does it force students to practice for competitions during studying seasons? Why not after exams when they have free time? This is a sign that the school is trying to squeeze in as many wins and as many trophies as possible to gain a better reputation.

Based on what OP has written, he seems well spoken and smart. And yet even grown adults treats him badly. If we take everything he says as true, there has to be some unknown variables that isn't written in his post. 

Now I'm not saying OP is definitely autistic, just thinking that it was a good guess. I think by pointing it out, it will help OP, because when random strangers with little to no bias, point it out, it carries more weight.

Singapore is pretty fucked up, in my time you were generally outcast if you had any interests outside the most common plebeian ones.

His behavior and responses to the teachers seem perfectly reasonable as well. Don't think it's fair to say ""oh your classmates and teachers don't like you so might be a problem with you"". I'm inclined towards the opposite in this case.

Doesn't hurt to get checked I agree but it might stigmatize OP if he thinks he is autistic. "
e6he22n,El_lel,"Would you rather he be on the spectrum and never finding out? Or he go find out and understands himself better? 

Yes his behavior and responses are perfectly reasonable. That's my point. He seems normal in his post and yet the results are so different! You have to remember he is writing from his POV. It's biased. These situations are rarely black and white.

Ok, you might be on the way to depression. Depressed people can look like the most happiest people in the world.. like Robin Williams.

What you need is a goal for yourself, not something that benefits you like lifting weights to look good, learning day trading to make more money for yourself.

You want something that can help you do something for others, maybe go to for volunteer work for old folk or animals. I prefer animals because im a bit cunty sometimes but animals makes me melts.. its hard sometimes to wear gloves to handle dogd cause of religion but its worth those doggy eyes (https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/a37nvk/volunteering-is-the-best-kept-secret-for-mental-health-stressweek2017)

You want to spend time with other people, gaming behind a computer screen is different from board game night with like minded people. Use Eventbrite to see what might interest you and go from there.

Even if you do something or learning by yourself, such as learning the saxophone like i am now, but you need to know it how will that help you mixed with people of similiar interest. Maybe a jam session or something.. thing is to keep learning new things.

Best thing to do when you feel depressed, is not to sleep.. never sleep. You are feeding it... Go for a walk (https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/walk-depression/).. to where? I dont know, just put on your slippers and pick a direction and obey the traffic rules and you be alright.

Routine work for me is something we got to go through, but what we do in the free time is what define us.

And lastly, you also might be a introvert like me. You might think, nah... Im not introverted, im loud and sassy.

Think of it this way, extrovert feels recharged when talking to people and being coup up and alone for too long makes them sad and depressed.
Introverts, get recharged by some alone time but when they need to be the life of the party, they will tap on that charged up source. (https://www.psychotactics.com/the-main-difference-between-extroverts-and-introverts/)

Understand that, you dont have to be or act happy all the time... It will tire you out. If it happens on that day you feeling melancholic, just keep your mouth shut and chill for the time being, other people will understand and once you ready to talk and be a happier version of yourself, You can even say ""sorry, i was a bit tired and lazy to talk just now.. one of those days you know?""

What else.... Stoicism, red pill and mgtows. The last 2 is purely for reading, take these methods with a grain of salt because some of it is Yishun level of crazy (i can make that joke because im from yishun) but there are alot of wisdom in there too... Stay away from incels.

In closing, no tldr and goodluck. You need help to talk about this thing.. just pm me. You dont have to go through life lonely.

The difference between alone and lonely is being alone is being by yourself, being lonely is being in a group of people and still feel alone."

dkosvpt,madfudz,Get subsidized care through polyclinic referral. It is worth it. I'm on subsidy. On a regular visit (1 every 6 weeks) I get charged just $36 for my consult and meds after medisave and subsidy :) I max out my ~~subsidy~~ medisave subsidy ($400 cap iirc) after 6 months though and it becomes like $90+ thereafter. Still pretty reasonable.

dkotyoy,hhlim18,My referral to see gastrologist from polyclinic is 2 or 3 months wait (a few years back). Month long wait for specialist isn't unique to mental health but standard for subsidized health care. 
dkow3l9,chAOtIcfErrEt,"I got referred to my current psychiatrist via CHAT. It's this group of healthcare professionals that work mainly with the youth. I was a clueless individual too. There really doesn't seem to be many avenues for people to start seeking help for their mental health, so I was really glad that there's such a team that I can approach. I basically arranged for an interview with them and they had me sit for a consultation with a psychiatrist. What i liked was that everything that happens there is off the records. Following that, they do give advice on what options you can choose. For me, I agreed on counselling sessions with their team's social worker but I did ultimately ask for a referral to a hospital. They do take into account your preferences (unless they have reason to believe you are in danger). For example, I refused to go to IMH because my sister works there, and I refused SGH because my friend had a terrible experience there. CHAT managed to arrange an appointment with KTPH within 2 weeks (which is surprising fast) and that's where I go to now. 

Sorry, this is more of my experiences with local mental healthcare services. My sister is a psychologist at IMH and I have friends who have both great and terrible experiences with healthcare services here. I am glad I got the better end of the bargain and I hope you do too. It does seem like you have no choice but to wait for a referral from a polyclinic or something but the likelihood of its priority being bumped up is higher since there's medication involved. 

This is becoming too long and I have to go get dinner. Have a great week, yea???? :)

Edit! Forgot to mention that my bills are subsidised too! So I pay like half the original price??? Meds are cheap too. A dollar or 2 for a months worth??? For me, at least."
dkotkax,FahadiHussein,"I used to work in a field similar, so I can give you some advice.

I am not sure what you meant by ""it will take a long time to see a psychologist"" and you talked about your medication. It is likely that you got the terms confused. A psychiatrist is who you are looking for and he will look at you and prescribe your medication. The first line of defence against mental illness in this country is still medication, so if it is urgent and you are running out of medication, you are able to get an immediate referral.

However, the government has always seen psychotherapy and counseling as optional, thus, there are usually not enough psychologists and you will have to wait for an appointment."
dm14xqy,borderlinebarbie,"hi! girl who has/had depression anxiety borderline personality disorder and was failed by singapore's mental healthcare but is much better now due to learning to take care of myself and find coping methods + homeopathic remedies:

-tell the polyclinic doctor your symptoms maybe embellish a little to get a sooner appt date. 
-maybe dont go to imh if not necessary (its abit incriminating + asian mindsets + stigma [im an imh patient])
- if super urgent/suicidal and such go to the ER but it probably will be in your records
- re: records, my psychiatrists always told me you dont have to declare them its your privacy unless i mean of course you have psychotic breaks that might happen at work that might cause danger to other people/yourself, my advice is if youre stable dont bother declaring

- geylang polyclinic has ""IMH"" psychiatrists and treatment 

- polyclinics can give basic anxiety meds for sleep if thats what you need

- so far for me i just go to the polyclinic, talk abt my history, they give me a referral and i get one pretty quick

- IMH has 2 clinics, for the wealthy and for everyone else. the ward is actly pretty fking nice lol its like a hotel, theres a gym theatre personal chef silk pyjamas and stuff (just that u have unstable roommates)

- I havent found an IMH doctor thats dedicated and cares, they just did the bare minimum and often were cynical and gave u the old asian tough love kind of care (my doctors were Indian nationals who were super harsh with me when i was fragile and a mess > i gave up cuz they reminded me of my abusive dad > probably shdnt give up and keep trying)

but its not their fault i guess, theres too many and theyre restricted by all the laws and such so they get so cold when treating patients

- mental healthcare system for my sister worked out good tho, shes getting treated for anxiety and used to (and still is) working for govt bodies (now in a different sector)
- bit more difficult if you have a history of suicidal behavious + psychotic breaks (will let u know when i get my shit tgt and embark on a career)
- DONT try ECT unless rly rly rly out of hand, try inpatient and rly rly try everything. had a friend that did ECT at mount alvernia (i think), she had to relearn how to read and write
- local hospitals always have medical social workers to apply for subsidy but sadly its a long process and if you dont fit the income bracket u need to give alot of paper work (maybe show loans of the people u live with to show u need the subsidy)
- local hospitals are good in the sense that u can pay later and say youre in the process of MSW (medical social worker) then you can pay like 10$ or sth first 
- so far my friends with suicidal hospital records to skill related jobs, ive yet to come across someone who has my type of medical records and works for govt so i rly dont know if its incriminating its more of a bitch to explain to recruiters why u have a three year blank of ""doing nothing"" when youre actly in and out of hospitals

long story short, there are ways dont give up! i wish someone had pushed me to not give up on the system because im sure there wouldve been someone to help me

good luck!"
dkot496,nyoten,"Yup when it comes to mental health SG is pretty crappy, but its the same in many countries also. I assume you came from UK? Which likely has the best mental health services in the world.

dkovt9f,FahadiHussein,"You have to take the point of view of the IMH psychiatrists as well.
Psychiatrists have to deal with insane number of cases a day. They have to see your condition and prescribe medication as quickly as possible and they have to see the next patient. They don't have time to be nice. They don't want to be nice also. Some patients have a tendency to ramble on if given the opportunity. This is to make sure that patients come and leave.

Many also confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist. They thought the psychiatrists can solve their issues but in reality, a psychiatrist can only help in suppressing the issues with medication and many can't do psychotherapy. If you want someone nice to talk, the IMH psychiatrist isn't the answer. Seek a counselor, social worker or a psychologist instead who are trained in psychotherapy and talk therapy."

I didn't despise the nurses and doctors, I understand how busy they can get, but damn it I spent 10 hours doing nothing waiting for you and you spend just 15mins asking yes or no questions. Plus the food sucks. 

But sometimes nice shrinks come by, are genuine, helpful and caring. I think all of them were caring at the start, but some get darkened by the ones they treat..."
dkp1it3,madfudz,"Let me delve deeper into your questions now that I've some free time. 

A referral from the polyclinic won't take months. It's at most 5 weeks, early if you need urgent medical care. I got mine about 4 weeks after getting a referral. You first get assessed at the polyclinic and do your best to be truthful, do not underplay or overplay yourself. After the assessment you will most likely receive a referral letter. Some clinics have psychiatrists on standby and they can prescribe medication for you while you wait to see a specialist.

Psychologists are the ones that focus on psychotherapy; they talk to you and explore thoughts, feelings, actions and try to help you understand your situation and formulate a plan on how to manage your situation. Psychiatrists tailer and dispense medication for your needs. 

Perhaps public doctors have a bad rep in the past, however, most of the public doctors I've seen are friendly and caring. There's a few bad ones but as an outpatient you can always change doctors. I personally receive great care from them.

Prices are very reasonable too, especially if you're Singaporean & subsidized. Iirc citizens that are in need receive further subsidies; I know of another patient that only pays a few dollars every time they see their docs. If you're strictly going to see a psychiatrist, the price after subsidy and medisave is usually $20-40. If you also see a psychologist at the same time then it is a bit more expensive, an additional $50-70 per session. 

At the topic of prices let's talk about insurance. Mental health insurance in Singapore is next to nothing. I am paying for a top tier medical insurance from Great Eastern and I only manage to claim $5000 yearly for any inpatient costs, and really little for outpatient cost that I don't bother. They need to step up their game. I don't know what medishield helps with but I can imagine it is similar. It's truly sad. 

Alternative options for mental healthcare: 

Private mental healthcare is fantastic here, but expensive. I am fortunate enough to be able to afford seeing a psychologist at Mt Elizabeth, I would recommend it if you can afford it. However, I do get my medication from Queensway Community Clinic. It is part of the IMH umbrella and the doctors there also serve at IMH. It is actually part of the Queensway Polyclinic. The reason I brought this up is because IMH is way too far from where I live (bukit timah). It may be an option for you if you're in a similar geographical situation as me.

NUH, NTFH, GH, CGH all too have a psych department and can dispense medication, and may strike a good balance between IMH and private practices. However slots are limited and I have no experience with them, so I can't comment.

All in all, I feel like if you need serious urgent help, go to their A&E especially if you are suicidal. Let loved ones know of your situation so that you can have support. If not do go the polyclinic route. I wish you the best and if need be, do pm me. Good luck and stay safe :)"
dkoufi6,madfudz,Typo. I meant maxed out medisave subsidy. Government subsidy is throughout. And yes medisave can be used for outpatient therapy.
dkq7nf1,madfudz,Haha I'm fine with once every 6 weeks. It's quite regular and doesn't eat too much of my time.
dkouu9n,FahadiHussein,"I am not sure but I can only speculate. Firstly, the government consists of largely by doctors and surgeons, who will most likely side with the use of medication. So far, I have not seen a psychologist, a TCM practitioner or even a nurse in the parliament who will fight for other approaches. Secondly, a colleague once told me that since independence, the government prefers the quick way of sedating the mentally ill through medication, which is why the practice still lingers on today.

There are counselors and psychologists at hospitals or charity organizations who specialize in counseling and psychotherapy. But no one will dare to take an unmedicated client for therapy."
dkouixd,tackyaf,"Also I just looked at the CHAT site and there is SO MUCH misinformation there!!! Like I appreciate the effort, but some of the things they write are actually harmful and I would not direct anyone there for an understanding of mental illness.

cx11mkj,sushifuntime,"I think that you should tell your mum's relatives what is going on before making any decisions. That way, they can help your mum alongside you and understand what exactly is happening before passing judgement. If they refuse to listen or if they think you're unfilial (the most common insult/accusation of nearly every Chinese family,) then you know that you shouldn't turn to them for help.

But since they are family, they should be less judgemental and be more willing to listen and help because that is what they are here for. Explain to them what is happening and what has been going on as calmly as you can. It will be hard to remain calm, so you can pause and take deep breaths while telling an aunt before continuing. It is also apparent that this crisis is too big for you to handle alone, so some intervention was in order anyway. 

After communicating with them, it would be useful to come up with an action plan so that as many people who can and are willing to help will lend a hand, and then you can talk about staying somewhere else. Be it staying with an aunt or uncle or moving in with your father, the decision that they help you make should be based on your welfare, and not be coloured by the dislike they feel for your father. At this point, this is all about the emotional well-being of you and your family, not anything about the quarrels in the past.

You should also tell your friends. Even if they can't help you, emotional support is very important. I can't stress this enough because sometimes you need to vent, and it can be depressing if you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to. Your school teachers/counsellors may also be able to help as well to figure out a solution, or to just lend a listening ear.

The other option would be talking to your dad, and to see if he's ok with helping to rent a room for you. I have two cousins who have had to live in dorm rooms (or hostels,) as their mother couldn't care for them anymore due to a mental illness. Perhaps an arrangement like that would help as well. 

Good Luck."
cx11man,shbazjinkens,"I had problems with my mom suffering more minor, but still annoying, mental illness and I don't regret getting out.  What I do regret is cutting off our relationship for a time after that happened.  If anything would have happened to her I would have never forgiven myself.  If you can find some way to make it clear to everyone that you still love your mother, but that you can't bear the situation any more and that's the only reason you're leaving, they may be able to come to terms with it.  Especially if it's clear you're still reaching out to her with love and kindness.

Also it's clear that you're extremely frustrated.  If this disagreement is devolving into shouting and high-intensity arguments, consider that your mom is mentally ill and it's up to you to exercise more control over the conversation.  Try to keep a level head even when you're fuming inside.  It's the only way I was able to convince family and friends that I wasn't the crazy one, because I kept a level head about it and explained the situation calmly.  One strategy is the criticism sandwich.  Start by saying something good about her, and how much you love her, then calmly explain your issue, and be sure to end with another kindness before she is able to interject and become upset about what you said.  That goes for any ongoing issues with the hoarding as well as the conversation you may inevitably have about leaving.  It may help to avoid the high-intensity arguments."
cx11jn3,stoneeus,"1. I fucking love the way you write your posts. Entertaining and engaging, please continue posting even after you've moved out.  
  
2. Move in with your dad. Fuck what others think - get yourself to a safe and sustainable environment first. If your cousins or whoever wants to give you shit, tell them to go sleep with the fucking cockroaches for a week and come back with the same advice. "
cx1j4gk,ehtoboy,"hey there,

many people are telling you that your dad is the best shot, but i think it's also important to consider about how well you know your dad's current situation before making a decision.

is he doing well financially? emotionally? mentally?
is he together with another woman? still sleeping around? married with new kids?

it would be best for you to get out from the predicament that you're in without having to find yourself in yet another one. if your dad's current situation is messed up, then it'd be good to consider your relatives who (i assume) you are more familiar with.

what you really need now is a respite from all this stress that you've been shouldering for such a long time, and that can only come from being with healthy family (not meaning no problems, but at least not significantly dysfunctional) with responsible adults who can give you good counsel and a conducive avenue for rehab.

assuming you hope to help your mom get better in time, i think talking to a relative from your maternal side could be the best shot. this is also because you know your cousins well and they'd probably be a lot more hospitable to you than your dad's new woman/family would. your cousins will also be able to lend you much needed emotional support. 

whatever your choice is, try to find a responsible adult to live in with - one that can provide you with a healthy environment to readjust and reconsider how you want to move forward from this. "
cx1j5ov,,"Hoarding is caused by [mental illness](https://www.imh.com.sg/wellness/page.aspx?id=1775). Unfortunately, in SG, we don't seem to have organisations  to help hoarders like [they do in the US] (http://hoardingcleanup.com/texas_decon_llc). 

You have two choices. I can sense that you still care a lot about your mother, despite your frustration. You have to stage an intervention. Tell your mother's sisters and get them to make your mother see sense. 

The other option would be to move in with your dad and never look back but I don't think you'll be able to make that decision easily. Sorry things are so hard for you. You seem very resilient actually and I hope you find a solution soon. "
cx14yt1,Probably_daydreaming,"I'm going to be extremely straightforward and practical here, no comforting words. 

First, *cut your loses*, at this point the need to improve your living conditions has far out weights the need to maintain your relationship with your mom and the people around you. 

You have prioritise your alternative living places quite nicely. 

Like the list, if at all possible, you'd dad should be the first and only person you should move in with. It would setting your living space nicely for a few months at least while you try to sort things out at your mom's house. 

However, if you are insistent with staying with your extended family, consider if they can take you in. If you want to approach them about it, contact them and tell them in a straight forward manner. Take a few pictures if your mom's house and message your aunts and uncles if you could meet them at their house in when they are free, explain what is going on with back at your mom's house and show them the pictures to emphasis your problems. See if you can work out a living solution with them from then. 

At this point, there is no reason to hide or put up a facade. Let everyone of your cousin, aunts, and uncles know your problem. This is not something you can handle by yourself anymore, you need a family intervention. 

One more thing, your school boarding school should be your last resort, a contiency plan. I would not recommend living with your friends as it brings a lot of problem and people who don't have to get involved. 

Once you have settle your living space, it's time to get down to business. Your living space may have improved but that doesn't mean your mom has and that should be your next goal. 

I am not really familiar with what to do here but the my idea would be to shift your mom to somewhere first, while they house gets clean up, then let her return to the house and then get her to seek help. At least this way, both you, your bro and your mom have somewhere sanitary to live, while she tires to sort out her mental issues. 

Currently, the first idea I'm thinking if is thag maybe you could get some outside help from family services, but I am also not too familiar with what services there are so I need to do a bit of Googling. 

The other idea is to get your family to help clean up the house and keep your mom away from the house as everyone clean. The only problem with this is that not everyone can sync up their schedules together, and that everyone must agree that something needs to be done to your mom's house. 

So far that's what I can think up of which is kinda as good of a plan as I can come up with without knowing anything personal about you. 

But all I know is that the thing triggered inside of you is the ""fuck this shit, I'm not doing this anymore"" moment. This is the moment when you cut all the negative, no matter the cost. If you need anything, you can PM me. 

Good luck OP, and God speed. 
"
cx18ows,wyngit,"All that said, have you thought of doing an intervention? Like get a couple of your maternal aunts/uncles to visit and see the situation for themselves/talk to your mum. Or a social worker/councillor.

I'm pretty sure at this point your mum is violating all sorts of fire safety codes, so even getting the condo management in might wake her up. It might freak her out and cause a meltdown, but someone or something needs to cause her to realize what's happening, come to a breakthrough and wakeup."
cx1w0a4,lozo,"Just a thought.... would an anonymous call to your condo's management complaining of cockroaches and pests coming from your place push them to ask for an inspection?

I think the condo's management may be a reasonably good third party that could be used to play ""bad cop""

also yeah, stay with your dad, whilst finding a way to inform your aunts. "
cx1dc4c,Hope83,"What you need to do now is to calm down. By calm down I do not mean a constant reacting, rushing to make a decision or doing something. You are like in a state of heightened anxious flux right now, going berserk, trying to deal with all the problems at one go. When you are awake, do not do things like deleting the post, then re-posting it again later on. Stop, take a step back, and assess the situation calmly. Only then can people help you.

**Only** viable option is to move in with your dad. It's basically weighing between your sanity and the relationships you have with the relatives on your maternal side. If I were you, I would like to keep my sanity very much thank you. And besides, if your relatives truly care about you, they would eventually see the truth and understand. If they don't, what exactly did you lose? You would have merely lost a bunch of pple who just never ever understand nor care. 

Moving in with an uncle or auntie isn't a long term solution. Moving in with a friend shows that you aren't even thinking straight, if you move in with a friend, your mum may come knocking on your friend's door creating problems for your friend and their family. Begging your school again shows that you haven't thought this through properly. The school is unlikely to allow this to begin with.

All options except moving in with your dad is unlikely to be a long term option.

And as I said at the start, deal with one problem at a time. 

The way I see you describe is, you are trying to solve all the following problems concurrently 
- how your moving out will affect your mum
- what's going to happen to your brother
- how my relatives will think of me 

Just focus on getting sanctuary with your dad for now and you can deal with subsequent problems one at a time later on when things are more settled down. 
"
cx116eo,ElyrionW,Your only realistic option is your dad. Stay strong. 
cx11ut2,BlazeDelta,"Like what people have mentioned, the most practical and realistic option is moving in with your dad. 
Of course, like you have mentioned, such a decision could cause negative repercussions, especially amongst your maternal side relatives who may or may not sympathise with your mother's situation. But I personally think, and many people here probably share the same sentiments, this isn't a decision made out of selfishness, this is out of necessity. Ultimately, if your maternal side relatives can't understand your choice... Well. We can't blame them luh, but they should open their eyes a little, no disrespect intended. 
Staying with your mom any longer will impact your well-being tremendously, for the worse, so as painful as the decision may be, you'll have to move to your dad's place. I suggest that you approach your school for assistance as well, or maybe a neighborhood CC or RC for help. 
Do keep us updated if you feel the need to. Stay strong, there are more people with you than you may think :) "
cx1x1nw,starrystarryme,"I will take option 1 and take lots of photo and video ...

cx1obor,idetectanerd,"i read your first article and this, i'm Wow at your courage on war with roaches. you just beaten many males here if you didn't know that.

anyway let an uncle advise you further.

to any problems and finding the solution to it, you need to identify what is going wrong. in the first post, many told you that your mom has depression which i do agree, hoarding is a mental illness if you know.

I actually pity both your parent and of course you and your brother, your dad probably found out that it is impossible for your mom to change that is why he went the easy way out having affair.

your mom being unable to afford things from young and start her hoarding spree is a torrent of unwanted stress and anxiety for your family.

as an engineer... we see problems as no problems.. there are solution but are you strong enough to take it on? i know as a 17 yr old lass, you are suppose to have fun with friends, living in a ordinary house etc but do remember that your case may be out of ordinary but definitely not the worst.

end of the day, are you willing that change? because change is an action not a word of advise, not something you speak but act.

I hope you does! so here are ways of solving this chunk of mess!

* even though you fight with your mom now, doesn't mean that you have to stop reminding her that she need to stop hoarding. like a child, to teach someone is to keep reminding it. you will be damn tired everyday for doing this but if the goal is for a cleaner house, PLEASE DO IT for your sake!

* start packing in small amount of her hoarding junk™ daily, put it in a briefcase and move it to the trash, don't let her see it anyway, if you gonna ask her permission, she won't allow anyway. you want to rid the roaches, you need to do this.

* start clearing your sanctuary first, this is where your peace is, her winter clothes? throw them away! 

* get lemon grass oil or essence, its pretty easy to get it from many places. roaches don't like them so start with your sanctuary, spray it at every corner you have, those accessible area first, then when you cleared up some part of your sanctuary, spray it too. 

* whenever you clear an area, sweep and mop your floor, clean your wall at least, those cracks and gaps you say on the wall? you will need to paint it. these take time and effort everyday a little bit, you will start seeing effect of a cleaner house.

* when these are cleared in your room, fix the broken electronics if you can, if you can't get someone else to help you. you should let your bf know about your situation seriously, this is where you will know if he is a keeper or not anyway.

* your mom would start noticing that some of her stuff being thrown away when you start moving it her stuff in the living room. so this will be the last 2nd item you will do.

* start cleaning the room full of book where the shelf came down. find a way to access it seriously, i'm pretty sure it is the most nasty place you every find, it could be like 10 year of dust and crap inside, be brave man.... 

* donate all these books to schools or whereever they need, if you have the time, do a PDF scan these books or download ebooks just if your mom want it back, tell her new age people don't read books anyway, we have ipads/android/kindles.

* when you finally clean up that room full of books, please start with your kitchen first, you can now get someone into the house to fix the broken stuff like heater, lamp etc. 

* when your mom kpkb about it again, tell her family members of her hoarding personal she has. tell them you need a clean space and you have already clean up that much, you show effort to clean up and proven that your mom indeed has hoarding syndrome. 

* let your mom knows you love her, you didn't side your dad for what he has done to her, tell her that she is breaking you and your brother up because of her hoarding, tell her you don't need all these books/junks, you need her and these junks is a bad memories of your childhood. 

you need to snap her out of her self consciences.

i wish you luck man, try doing all these before your university start. its tough yet doable. "
cx1li30,Lunyxx,"Talk to your maternal side cousins about it, whether they understand you or not, that's up to them already. Best option is to move in with your dad, try not to drag your friend into this, will end up messy.

As for the cockroach situation, although you are not scared of it, but having those roaches is never a good sign. Have you try putting roaches poison?

I have a few questions, hope you don't mind answering:

* Reading your first post, how can she afford to buy all those stuff, it's not like those stuff are cheap.

* Do you see any particular trend of her hoarding behaviour, eg: after an argument or at certain months in a year ?"
cx1t4gf,Ryuuki,"I'm so sorry to hear this... Think a lot of people already mentioned it, but the only viable option now is to move in with your dad. He's the closest and most reasonable option out of all you listed.

cx1xwom,amancalledfroggy,"First let me say that there is usually no immaculate solution to complex problems. The way about it is to chip away at it in order of priority and ease of action. The easiest degree of freedom for you is to enlist some volunteers to clear out your home. But thats only a temporary fix as without treatment your home will fill up with junk again. In my opinion the most important thing for you is to ensure that your brother's and your own future is not jeopardised. How can you focus on school with such emotional baggage holding you down. Relationships with your mom and relatives can be rebuilt over time, dont let that hold you back from doing what is most important.

A (significant) portion of your mom's alimony is technically ment for you and your brothers upkeep. Your mom is just the custodian of it as both of you are minors. If your mom was found to not be of sound mind then she cant be your legal guardian and manage your finances for you. Now im not a lawyer but im sure there is a mechanism to declare her to be unfit to manage your affairs for you and thus allowing you access to funds you require to move out. Public policy Is highly protective of minors and **im sure some legal industry redditors can point her to some pro bono advice**.

In the mean time stay strong, talk to your school principal, schools now a days have significant resources to help those who are less fortunate and can further escalate the issue to social services. Theres no shame in seeking help, the most important thing is to not allow your circumstances to affect you and your brothers future."
cx2ysyh,KB-Jonsson,"Hi and welcome back! Good that you took some action for yourself but take it easy and be patient. The only one that will truly understand your situation and how dire it is is your dad. He eventually left his whole family to get away even though he tried to talk to your mom for several years, he will understand you.

Begin with contacting your dad and just ask to meet to talk about this, nothing more. Ask for his advice, tell him the situation about he cousins etc and see what he says then take it from there.

Dont agitate your mom anymore as I fear it will only make the situation worse when/if you do leave. If you find a solution elsewhere, be sure to let her know that she is still your mom and your family but you can no longer accept the living conditions. Say it so they know that it is not a discussion or an argument but your actual situation. Do not allow any ultimatums or such stupid things. Tell your brother the same, he has to make up his own mind and he will once he starts seeing girls and such. Give it time and be open, mature and diplomatic, dont make big dramatic scenes and help to save face where its possible, make regular visits and I think you will be able to stay on good terms."

It is tough for children raised in isolation by a dysfunctional single parent like in her case. The guilt, even when you have done nothing wrong. The instruction to protect the parent is programmed into you.

The option of getting a maternal relative involved is perhaps easier. OP is worried it will jeopardise mother's relationship with them. But really, to get mother the treatment she needs, the isolation and secrecy must be broken first, and it will hurt like lancing a boil. 

The other option is for OP to save herself by getting herself out of the house without revealing the reason, but this will put her in a bad light.

Between the devil and the deep blue sea, as they say. My sympathy to OP. Stay strong, get the help you need, and hope for the best. Things might hurt before they get better. Maybe speak to a school counsellor first, especially if you are distressed. Helps to calm down, and getting an external perspective and to clarify your priorities helps."
czw6xlx,Dreamwaltzer,"> However, in an Asian society like ours,

I don't think we should ever let such a thing hold us back. That we should do or not do something simply because of societies perception and ideals. 

Like whats the alternative? You stay faithful to your abusive parents? Just to make random strangers think better of you? What good does that do you? I feel it is rubbish to blindly stick to values.

czw9vw9,chanzjj,"I hate this Asian society/Asian values argument. What does our values have to do with our geography.

Honestly it depends on a case by case basis but I believe there are definitely legit reasons to cut off contact with your parents (e.g. abuse etc).

I also feel that parents have a greater obligation to their children than children have to their parents. After all, your parents are the ones who decide to bring you into this world so they should take responsibility for it. I don't believe parents should expect children to take care of them/provide for them as they get older."

I believe that each person chooses to limit/ cutoff ties with others, be it friends or family, for a reason and each circumstance should be viewed on a case by case basis before passing any judgement. 

Perhaps my view on this is skewed by this but I would also like to say that I feel that many times, an estranged family could actually be amended with sufficient amount of effort and sincerity from both sides. Of course, there would be exceptions, but I would not think anyone any lesser for whatever family situation they might find themselves in.  Family status is not necessarily an indication of the individual's character and personality.

On a side note, I find that the stuffs my father has gone through had actually made him a much more loving father. He doesn't want the family to go through the same thing as he did and it really touches my heart from time to time. Jack Neo could make another family value movie out of this lol.

I respect them because they taught me right from wrong and provided for me. I don't love them because I *have to*, I love them because they have earned my respect. 

If you have shit parents, you have the right to walk away from them forever. Abusive parents are lousy people and nobody needs that kind of negativity in their life. There comes a point where the toxic things they have done outweigh the positive, and that's where you take a step back and think about your relationship with them.

My childhood was not particularly happy because they separated for a while when my siblings and I were young and I still feel resentful over that. 

This filial piety thing is heavily emphasized in Singapore because the government simply wants to offload the burden of caring for our elderly to their families rather than treating them as individuals when they are in need. Note that you pay taxes as individuals, not as families. If I pay my taxes regardless of family situation, then I should damn well get my benefits regardless of my family situation. "

czy64o9,ChinaWine_official,I'm quite utilitarian about this. Cut them off if you want to. But remember to pay them back what you owe when you start earning. I see cases whereby elderly parents get abandoned because none of their well-earning kids want to take care of them. And some of them get away with their parents house and assets sometimes too. That's just stealing. So just remember to pay them what you owe (plus inflation). Because its the right thing to do.
czwkxcd,Hope83,"I recall there's at least two redditors over the last half a year where the redditor themselves mentioned that they are being emotionally/verbally abused at home and looking to get away from their parents. Both cases I recall are around the age you mentioned. And in both instances, the general responses of the redditors were quite sympathetic towards the person.

Whether it's justified or not, it really depends on the situation. Most of the time we are hearing from only one side of the situation and things could have been taken out of context or exaggerated. But if the situation is valid, why would they be unfilial to do so? 

If the parents themselves are being irresponsible with their words and actions, aren't performing a proper duty as parents, and instead behaving like ""terrorists"" (ie. terrorizing their own kids), scarring their children emotionally and in some cases physically, I will say, run far and run fast. Don't see how such parents deserve to have filial piety from their kids. "

But if there was a history of abandonment/abuse/trauma, is it still fair to use the children as the ""first line"" (before the state, anyway) when it comes to providing financial support for the elderly person? Does that not drag up a whole lot of trauma, as well as just seem unfair to expect a child who suffered abuse to then give money to the parent who might have done the abusing?"

Discipline and punishments, when used in the right way, also serves as another form of education.

sorry to see this post late, but here's what I would advise, take note that some of what I said will overlap with what others have shared.

The first step you can and should do is to see a MP. The MP can write a letter to HDB and it's possible for them to direct you to a welfare home or homeless shelter. MP letters can carry a lot of weight depending on the situation. They could also refer you to a family service centre where the social workers there might be able to help you, be it financially through Comcare or with the housing issues.

Solve the housing issue thing first, and any other resources you need, I would be able to easily assist. 

But the most important thing I wish to tell you is, do not give up hope. And as much as you resent your dad, and as much as it is a terrible situation for you all these years, I hope that you would be able to choose to not see yourself as a victim and understand that you still have a bright future ahead of you. Yes it may be difficult for you to envision or see that bright future now, but there is as long as you don't give up.

The fact that he wants to waste away his life doesn't mean you should too.

Go to the main office of a church and ask the person working there who is the person in charge of SSVP. You don't have to tell them its for you, but they'll direct you to them. You can explain your situation to the person in charge and at meetings, they'll figure out what is the best way to help you. They'll usually give out both cash allowance and NTUC vouchers every month, the amount depending on each family's needs. They may also have rations every now and then, and little parties to spread some joy. Pretty sure they'll also help to find for jobs and stuff, and also some guidance on government/housing issues.

If your friends grades are improving, shouldn’t her parents be more supportive rather than criticising and arguing with her even if the Teachers are being negative.

It’s not only Singapore’s system that is competitive. I know people who study overseas who are under a lot of pressure to get high grades in their exams. Alot of things can definitely be improved in the Singapore education system but blaming this problem entirely on the education system probably isn’t right."
e6t3apw,lucific_valour,"What does ""Singapore's education system"" have to do with this?

Your friend is stuck between a bad teacher and an uncaring parent.

For the teacher, escalate the issue or seek counseling. Everybody carries a handphone, no? Record down any incident she finds abusive, make sure the data is backed up, and then report the incident with evidence.

Her mother is unsympathetic, which is lousy parenting, but not a crime. ""But her teacher says so, that's why she got wrong impression."" Eh Auntie, check your facts before scolding your daughter, maybe?

> constantly trying to improve herself by taking notes during class and studying individually at home

Well, yeah. Everyone who wants good grades does this. Self-study, group study session, tuition, at home, at Starbucks. 

> Every time she improves herself, the teachers just raise the bar higher and find more things to scold her for.

e6txwbm,Kyzrel,"In any schools, there will always have bad and good teachers. Some are in the profession for the money, others for ideals. 

I was from a SAP school myself and I remember very clearly how my teacher told my mom I won't make it in life because I take for granted that I am smart and don't put in hardwork. And my mom retorted her saying she never expected me to be a high flyer, so long as I am happy that's most important. My mom is my idol till today. 

A lot of pressure from schools to outperform on results especially those independent schools where they need to keep their ranking etc. It's almost like a corporate responsibility to answer to the board of directors hence the culture is very brutal. But to be fair, I also had nurturing teachers who wasn't like that. 

Parents need to understand that school today is very different from when they were schooling. The pressure to be a perfect student is outrageous. Every child is different and have strengths and weaknesses like any human being. Why need to emotionally threaten your kid with tears? I am so sorry that your friend has to suffer like that, she is lucky she has you as a friend. Encourage her to be resilient.

Life will always throw curve balls at you, it's a part of growing up. Treat it as a challenge to 磨练自己. Even if the whole world don't believe in you, you have to believe in yourself."

e6t0hzv,junnies,"In the end, people must find their own strength and conviction to deal with their own problems. Yes, it might not be easy, but this is how things often are (and there is satisfaction overcoming challenges).

The idea that 'things/people' aren't good enough is often a common enough situation that one eventually will run into if they live in society. The problem isn't that there are people who find fault or think you aren't good enough, but that you try to please them and try to live up to their standards. The idea or feeling of 'not being good enough' is often a dysfunctional pattern by itself, and being an ingrained pattern of dissatisfaction, there will never be an outcome where things will ever be good enough. Rich, attractive, famous celebrities crash and burn out on drugs and feel that life is not good enough because life will never be good enough if one holds onto that mentality.

If a person is to live their own life, a life of their own terms and not one of people-pleasing, they have to develop their own strength and courage to be themselves. Your friend now has her teachers and parents telling her that she is not good enough, and when she graduates and goes on to work, she will find employers and colleagues telling her she is not good enough. Is she going to keep feeling terrible and helpless because others tell she is not good enough, or should she develop the strength and inner sense of self-worth to ignore them and have confidence in herself?

***

What your friend should do is to decide that she can no longer be a people-pleaser and that she will do what she feels best for her. If the teacher finds fault and threatens to call her parents, she should say 'go ahead. I have done my best and if my best is not good enough for you, so be it'. And if the mother berates her for being a terrible daughter, she should respond ' I have done my best, and if my best is not good enough for you, so be it'. In the end, your friend's life and happiness lies in her own hands and not her teacher or mother's."

One thing about such big powerful schools is that while they may have their own approach in ensuring results, they are extremely sensitive to bad press and media coverage.

My suggestion is TO HAVE SELF CONFIDENCE AND BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS WAYS YOU CAN IMPROVE YOURSELF without coming up with a convenient excuse that the system is too competitive etc. Of course no system is perfect and there will be examples like the teacher in this case but honestly if you or your friend adopt the correct attitude to face it it wouldn’t affect you too much, as long as you have self belief.

The teacher can always be biased like the teacher can say that a student did badly, but it can just be because the teacher expects much more from that one specific student compared to the rest of the class, even though that student probably did average or better. It happens because teachers actually think this will spur students on, but it's actually pretty demoralizing - I still don't understand why this mentality exists - regardless of the student, if they do well, then just acknowledge their effort, pretty sure leaving them satisfied and happy with a little praise goes a longer way than demoralizing them"

You are certainly not getting the cream of the crop then. Probably need to look into talent acquisition policies.

If the people under you are quite senior in their late 40s-50s then the argument is moot since they are not recent products of the education system.

If the people are quite junior and you are CEO of a startup, then you probably need to expand your net outside Singapore. Outside finance-related sector most of the top tier talent would have moved overseas for opportunities and pay. "

No, that's why I said you're either a troll or you are highly intelligent (can't think of a better word) for your age.

It's statistically way more likely that you are a troll in reddit. But after looking at your post history I'm convinced you are who you say you are.

I actually identify somewhat with what you are going through as I attended the GEP and my friends and I faced some situations similar to yours (didn't get particularly stressed about PSLE because my parents assured me that they didn't care but gave me shit after I got 269, etc) 

Singaporeans are generally rigid in their thinking and will dismiss your thoughts due to your age. You need to find an adult IRL who doesn't immediately dismiss you that you can discuss your situation with and seek advice from. Ideally your school should have a teacher or someone like that as well, eg a school counselor or something. Otherwise you can pm me if you want to chat. I can understand how it's hard to trust someone in your situation after getting shit on many times but the sad truth is without you parents or a teacher to champion you you basically have no way to address your situation. 

I read your ""school is killing me"" post. 

It seems like you are depressed and have not been able to seek help? Have you talked to your parents about it? Otherwise, you should definitely speak to someone in your school about it. You can pm me anytime if you want to discuss your options.

>EDIT: Yes I am studying in what everyone calls a ""top school"". SAP school, IP programme.

All the more this is absolutely unacceptable behavior from your teacher, hopefully this is not a systemic problem in the school. If you are comfortable you can PM me to discuss what options you have. I may be able to connect you to people who can help you/your friend. "
e6ubem9,WittyKap0,Nope he's definitely the real deal
e6ubasl,damstereiw1,"Thank you for sharing. Anyways, in what what way are you able to help me may I ask?"
e6udvpl,Apocsky_,Fair enough. Went to actually read with a lil more time and it does seem so.
e6ubhin,WittyKap0,"I will pm you later.

But just a tip in future, don't reveal your age on reddit, people will pre judge you or think you are a troll. You might want to create a new account or something if necessary "
e6ue1kj,Razermeister,I sort of agree that OP might seem to be exaggerating to a certain extent but kudos for acknowledging your first judgement wasn't a good one

My wife and I are both like that. It's a good creed to live by but it certainly has caused ourselves and others a world of hurt during school years.

I'm not asking you to lie, just don't reveal your age unless absolutely necessary. On a need to know basis. It's just like how female gamers often hide the fact that they are female or avoid voice comms to avoid abuse. 

"
dxs6zdx,TheBestLiesAhead,"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. I grew up with poor hearing too and I understand how frustrating it can be to not be able to listen properly and having people repeat their words constantly. Please do not think that you are a burden to your family, they love you and understand your challenges, even if they do not explicitly say it. The nature of life is challenging and you are defeated only when you stop trying. 

You can find an entry level job temporarily to tide you through for the time being while saving up for further education, that will then grant you employment opportunities in your desired industry/sector.

You seem to be looking for opportunities only in the IT sector. May I ask why you are only looking in this sector? Yes it is a growing sector but unfortunately such a sector requires specialized skills that benefit from education, not just in Singapore but everywhere else. 

You can pick up programming yourself, learning common languages such as Java and Python and developing applications online, contributing to open source projects, that will help you build a portfolio that may land you a job even without any qualifications. Keep an open mind and look for opportunities in other industries as well. All the best  and do not give up. "
dxt1vhs,Brahcival,"Suicide is never the answer. 

There are still so many avenues for you to pursue. Singapore actually has many free vocational training places (like the devan Nair institute) to help train you AND help you job hunt.

It might be time for you to take a step back and stop having tunnel vision on the IT industry if it isn't working. You're right, in Singapore education is really important. You might want to consider finishing your N's and O's or taking some certs and diplomas to beef up your resume.

There are people and systems in place to help you buddy, do not give up, do not lose hope. You can do this.

dxt3gtb,gentlemansincebirth,"Do consider maintaining a ""side hustle"" while working a regular job. Many here are recommending a fastfood job, but you mentioned that you have a knack for assembling PCs. I feel this is a service you can market and slowly grow via social media and word-of-mouth. 

In fact you can expand the scope to include smaller jobs such as video card upgrade installation, or hard drive replacement, etc. 

What I'm getting at is to put your eggs in other baskets when you can. While doing so may not be entirely successful, it will open up new paths for your life to take. Thereby giving you more and better options to upgrade your situation. 

Some good tips on starting a side-hustle here: https://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/07/30/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-i-confronting-your-objections/ "
dxt5swu,Vyrena,"You need a few things. 

1) Your hearing problem is pretty much the cause of everything. You should seek medical advice asap. At the same time, look for the social work / financial assistance office to see if you can get some subsidies for medical treatment. You need to get it treated because hearing is important for yourself and also for any future studies and work. 

2) You need money. Either from starting a business, or from a job (full time or part time). Some sort of finances. Your highest education is PSLE and this limits the potential range of jobs you can do. You need to think of a way to solve this fast. In short, you need to improve yourself in order to get better work opportunities. 

Communication is important in many jobs and social interactions. Hearing difficulties will be a big problem because if you can't understand others, it will be hard to respond. This will not only affect your education but also work with colleagues. 

Once your get some sort of income, seriously consider going back to school or take up a course somewhere. Your passion is in IT, however, IT requires specialized skill sets. It is not something that you can easily pick up. Others have spent years and years in education on it. 

3)  Work out a plan for your family's finances. Working in a fast food, or anywhere else at the moment will be a challenge for you. If you actually have to feed your entire family, the income from such jobs is insufficient. The hard truth would be that even if it means that you have a job, you will not be able to provide sufficiently for your family. Maybe you will barely be able to provide by working long and hard hours, at the cost of your health. But you will get older, and your body weaker. It is a natural part of life and by then, you may be too old to learn and not as strong as before. You will be stuck on the treadmill running towards the next pay check for your entire life. And by that time, it may not be enough. 

Try to see how much leeway you can get. How much income would you barely need and set aside the rest for self improvement. There is this skillsfuture thing right now and I suggest looking at the website and speak to one of the operators or what to see how they can assist you. 

4) Other forms of work. There are some online work which communicate via email or text which means you actually dont need to ""hear"" your clients. You can be a freelance designer, coder, translator etc etc. 

5) Have you been through NS? You can consider going to NS. Because of your hearing problem, you will most likely be a non combat vocation. You get some allowance and your family would have one less mouth to feed for 2 years. You can scrimp and save and use that time to think on how to improve your situation. Education / technical courses is the only way forward. (Unless you have a knack for business) "

I didn't drop out of secondary school, but through a combination of laziness and depression, I did really badly for o levels, and barely got into a diploma I have near to no interest in. 


Right now, I really want to drop out, go do NS, then try to enroll in another diploma. But that would create so much trouble for everyone... My parents... Me.... My parents. 


I hate having to make all these decisions and I don't even know if they're the right ones. I feel like I'm not equipped to handle this stupid life.


I'm not going to say other people have it worse than you, because honestly, my problems are peanuts compared to you. And I realise it's hypocritical of me to say I don't want you to commit suicide, because I want to commit suicide.

dxt24ab,PureSmoulder,"1. I just bought a bunch of related course equipment, including uniforms, and other tools that cost over a 100 dollars.

2. If I drop out now, I'll have to wait a year before being able to go to NS.

3. Applying for a new diploma is a headache all by itself. I don't even know how to start.


4. It's probably the Singaporean hive mind mentality, but dropping out just feels *weird*."

dxt4zng,thestoryteller69,"Hey man, first of all, it's amazing that you've managed to keep going in a course that you hate. So it probably doesn't feel like this now, but you've already done something very impressive. 

You say you want to switch courses eventually and that's great... If you hate studying what you're studying, can you imagine working in that field for the rest of your life? 

Just a suggestion... since you know what you want to do, if you drop out of your current course, you may be able to find an internship or something in the field that you're interested in. That would give you a very big advantage when you apply for your new course, or even for another job. Heck, even for personal development it would be great. 

Lastly, you already know what you like at a young age and that is a big advantage. It gives you the ability to plan around it and save years of your life. So, life sucks right now but eventually I'm sure you will see the positive effects of this hidden advantage. "

cv2a0q4,UnparagonedWisdom,"Dear OP, first and foremost, I would like to let You know that She's not ready for a relationship. Her self esteem is clearly reliant on You and it's inherently wrong. She has to learn to love herself before she can learn to love You. 

Apart from that, do have a serious talk with her about how much You love her. Assure her on how much she means to You. Slowly ease into telling her how much it hurts You to see her hurt herself but mention the fact that if she ever intentionally hurt herself because of an argument with You, you'll be even more angry and upset. 

Explain to her that for her to be able to accept that you love her, she has to learn to love herself more. Also know that, it's hard to stop cutting yourself but small steps do play a part in helping. For example, getting rid of the blades that she use. Ask her and make her dump the blade away into the rubbish bin or chute where she can never retrieve. As much as You think it doesn't matter, it's symbolic and it affects her psychological. Also, I'm guessing her cuts look like llllllll on the wrist? Do note that if a person wants to kill themselves, they will cut like this ""_______""
I'm hoping it's the first one so at least You know she's not too far gone yet.

Lastly, explain to her what she is doing is emotional blackmail and how if she keeps doing this, one day You will not be able to take it and you will walk away. After telling her all of these, assure her that You still love her very much and that You want to be there for her every step of the way for her to be a happier and healthier version of herself.

I hope this helps. "
cv251ho,dekonig,"You might have to accept that some problems are a little too big for you to handle. Good intentions and love are fantastic but when it comes to psychological issues and self harm, sometimes you have to accept that she might need professional help. I wouldn't pressure her into it, let her know that you're there for her always, but also that it's a serious problem and there are professionals who can help her far better than you can."
cv2686s,vanillaplease,"She needs to figure out a healthier way to distract herself. Maybe going for a walk, writing, drawing, singing, cooking? (There are other ways to get a dose of endorphins.)

Explain that you understand that she's got her own way of dealing with emotional anguish, but it's not healthy, & it worries you. Be patient when you're talking to her. Show her that you're concerned, not that what she's doing displeases you. Listen to what she has to say, then suggest a healthier alternative.

It's not going to be easy because she's been cutting for a while, & to her, it's a tested & proven method of coping.

Having said all of that, don't be an emotional hostage in your own relationship. I know it's horrible to have to live with that fear, but there's not much you can do really. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

What you can do for yourself, is to not feel responsible when she chooses to hurt herself. & if all else fails, like /u/dekonig mentioned, get her to seek professional help.

All the best."
cv39b49,AllMyDays,">she sent me a picture of her cuts

Just call her out for the attention whore she is and dump her, this one will give you too much drama in your life long term.

If you don't realize it yet she's showing you pics so that she can manipulate you into obedience or something stupid like that. She actually took pics of the non-deep non-threatening cuts yo, its express fucking purpose is not for ""Distracting muh self"" but rather sending it to you.

cv287qs,,"There are a few categories of cutters. People who cannot help themselves tend to be ashamed and hide the scars.on the other hand, your gf seems like the type who cuts to gain attention. 

When things are calmer, suggest you have a talk with her and explain how you felt . Let her know if she wants to bring to your attention, you are available and you don't want to lose her or see hurt herself.

On your end, if it happen again, keep in mind that don't overreact ( I know it is hard) and checked her action. Don't pandered to her and be firm"
cv28rh1,MrDLTE3,"Doesn't sound like a healthy relationship if she sends you a text image of her inflicting self-harm. She probably is trying to instill guilt into you with connotations of "" You made me do this "" which imho borders on a tad of the unstable and crazy. 

My sincere advice is, either give her professional help now or be prepared to suffer the potential future consequences of her threatening to implicate you with her self-harm when the next BIG argument happens. Shit will definitely hit the fan sooner or later. 

Good luck"
cv2dtmq,Hope83,"Short reply due to using phone. 

Those who cut, do so to help themselves feel the pain.They do not know how to deal with/express the emotional pain they feel inside, thus they cut in order to feel the physical pain instead. When you argue with your gf, she feels hurt, she feels pain, turmoil inside, but she doesn't know how to cope with it. Cutting herself makes her pain feel real. 

From what you have described, what your girlfriend needs is a counselor/therapist to help her work through her emotional issues. 

As for yourself, if you are having some form of anxiety disorder, it's really rather a bad combination. Because to deal with someone who self-harms, you need patience, and you need to be able to actually accept her in spite of the fact that she's cutting herself. You need to be able to listen, be calm even if you know she's cutting herself. You need to know that this is NOT an attention-seeking attempt as much as what others might say. And no, she is not doing this as an easy way out. She doesn't know how else to cope.

Bear in mind that as her partner, you are NOT her therapist. You are not here to fix her. You are here to love her, that means accepting her, helping her to get help from professional sources. This means that you do not have to feel inadequate even though it's a natural feeling to have, because it was never your responsibility to solve.

The feelings of anger/frustration is understandable, but however, actions resulting from anger/rage is counterproductive. 

Your own anger merely stems from your own feelings of inadequacy. See things in a different paradigm, and you will be able to deal with this better.

Apologies for the late replies, amidst health issues and work and my girlfriend, I've only been able to read the comments and not sit down to reply. I know that you all have good intentions, and I will give you guys an update and respond to all comments when I have the time. It is heartening to know there are other Singaporeans willing to set aside some time to help someone in need. I really appreciate it :')"
cv3c2p1,nova9001,"I have to say that you have to be prepared to put up with this for the long term. People don't change overnight some change for the worst. If you are unable to handle the idea of her cutting herself, it might be good to give up now."
cv24txe,AveLucifer,Love her. 
cv39rmp,andeservedhero,Show her where the major arteries are and tell her not to waste time anymore
cv3abga,help-me-understand,"Thank you for the advice. I completely agree with you on the fact that she isn't ready for a relationship because of her lack of self esteem and self worth. She often tells me she's ""only alive because of me"". I've brought it up to her but she is helpless in trying to change, and so am I. I can hope that with enough love and encouragement she will grow to love herself and know that she herself is worth living for.

I do constantly express my love with words and actions, and whenever I sense any doubt on her side, I am quick to address it. I know she knows I love her, and from this recent incident, she knows I'll get mad and upset if she hurts herself. (Though I don't think she understand the pain I feel)

Yes, she cuts like ""||||||"", and I know she has no intention to end her life. When I first found out, I was unable to get her to get rid of the blade, but in a spur of anger I snapped at her to listen to me, and she did. After speaking to her again yesterday, she has assured me that she will not cut herself again unless we break, which is far from what is desired. However, after much being firm on my side, she has agreed to seek professional help if she ever cuts again.

I did mention that I feel like she's holding me emotional hostage, although I cannot bring up the part about me being unable to take it and walking away if this continues. She has made it clear she'll face suicidal thoughts if I leave, and I don't want her to deal with the feeling that she may face such pain in future.

I'm still in the process of understanding and helping her, and I thank you all for the perspectives and advice, at least I feel less at a loss now. It is much appreciated :)"
cv3adru,help-me-understand,"Thank you for reminding me that, I have always been hesitant about whether I should coax her to seek professional help when she is so unwilling. She feels that even though these actions are not normal to me, it's very normal to her and she knows her limits. I have told her that I will not negotiate and let this persist, and she has agreed to seek help if it happens again. I have yet to, but I intend to remind her I will always be by her side for her to talk to if all she needs is a listening ear."

du4p80k,zuoboO2,"The IO will follow up with your case to ensure that you wont be trying/ attempting 'suicide'. Depends on the IO he might/ might not refer you to specialist for treatment.

Even though many of the comments are saying that the police are not helping by arresting them, do note that its against the law and they are just doing their job. It's the doctor/ specialist job to aid for treatment.

You mentioned that you never had the intention but only did so due to panic, do note that the police can't just let someone who hold a knife at their throat just walk away without doing something which is arrest."
du4t2d8,Feelgoodfood,"I attempted suicide. The police got called down to the hospital after I was admitted to the a&e. They then proceeded to take my statement and left.

Got called down to the police station after I was discharged from the hospital. Wasn't a big deal. Just got scolded a lil/nagged at by the IO and was let off with a warning. "
du50z12,ceddya,"If you're seeing a psychiatrist and if the IO is aware of it, the IO will probably contact your psychiatrist for an assessment of your condition. That's actually in your favor.

More to the point, for offenses like yours due to extenuating circumstances (and especially if it's the first 'offense'), I'm very sure you'll be let off with a just warning. 

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just keep seeing your psychiatrist and psychologist and hopefully you'll feel better soon!"
du4mjt6,thedooood,"I'm sorry to hear that. They should not be criminalizing attempted suicide, and should be providing therapy instead of trying to put you in jail. Hope you're getting the support that you need."
du4rh5t,milkmatchatea,"Honestly they'll probably just check in on you as a sort of follow-up to your case. Nothing severe, please don't worry, maybe take a statement or some shit then you can go off already.

du5vs96,three_nights_in,"Hey there. First off, sorry about everything that happened. Hope you're better, and **do** go seek and receive the help you need.

Secondly, I went through a similar case with my SO before. SO actually sat over a ledge while I was sleeping. SCDF and SPF were alerted and came to the scene. However, SO decided against acting on those thoughts, and came back to the house before SCDF and SPF could find who it was on the ledge. I convinced SO to admit to officers at the scene, because:

1. They would definitely investigate thoroughly and it would almost be certain they would find out who it was on that ledge, as my neighbourhood had many CCTVs.

2. SO would likely be dealt with more harshly if admission of guilt was not ASAP, as it was impossible to miss the presence of SCDF and SPF at the scene and therefore it would almost definitely be counted against her when considering the case. 

So SO admitted to officers at the scene, and I accompanied her to the psych review and was released on the same day. We both had to give statements, separately. Thereafter, SO had to report regularly to police station, akin to probation. After a few months, SO was let off with a formal warning and no repercussions since. Of course, it depends on your case and any factor could change the outcome, but this was my SO's experience.

Stay strong, OP."

I had something similar happen to a relative, she was arrested for sitting on the ledge of a multi-story carpark. After she was arrested and processed, she was sent to IMH for evaluation. 

She was released after making bail, and was told to report back to the Police Station. When she went back, they made her sign some report sheet and told to report back on a later date. Apparently, the IO wasn't done investigating the case (etc just wasting your time).

Not sure if your case will be the same since you held a knife. Anyway, I wish you all the best and hope you are in a better place now."

Despite what the penal code says about attempted suicide I really can't see anything happening to you.

In other countries they tend to shoot first and ask later. I also have some experience with this in Singapore as a friend was tasered while holding a knife here.

du4pg1l,stephaniechuuu,"Alright, thanks. 

We are all aware that they are just doing their job and is against the law. We are just stating our opinion that it is not helpful to anyone to arrest someone when they attempt suicide. Whether the law gets repealed in the future is up to the government. That is all. 

I'm aware. That's why I'm not kicking up a fuss about being arrested. I'm just mentioning that I had no intention to kill myself so that I don't get the typical ""I hope you find a reason to live"" replies.  "
du4u453,plumpig,"I had almost the exact same experience. Was quite humiliating because I was partially undressed while they took my statement. I was topless with those EKG stickers stuck on my chest and apparently they thought it was a good time for an interview. They were policewomen but still...

Edit: Phrasing. "
du5l41t,hhlim18,"They need to criminalize it. Without criminalizing it isn't police business. Police would have not reason to attend to suicide case, they would have no obligation to stop suicide, they wouldn't have reason to follow up and check is him still at threat to himself of the general public. 

Edit
Looks like people here wants suicide to be treated like a non-crime but wanted the resources of criminal case. They want police to act but they don't want to give police the justification to do so. "

du4v7lu,Feelgoodfood,"That's horrifying how they took your statement while you were topless. Policewoman or not I would have felt hugely uncomfortable and violated.

I felt a similar kind of humiliation when I was bed bounded in the a&e and a group of med school students looked at me like a specimen (I was not their patient). 

Anyway I sincerely hope you are doing well or at least staying afloat too, friend! :) "
du5udy8,stephaniechuuu,I was stripped nude in the police hq so....  Not dismissing or belittling your experience.  Just sharing.

du5rhay,raspberrih,What I heard is that it's technically illegal to commit suicide so the police can go into your house to stop you. 
du5m2ph,gmdotes,"not true

du5wc1r,three_nights_in,"Yes, I did. I'm sorry if I came across as uncaring/not hearing what you say, but your reaction to the police showing up does generate my concern. Understandably you panicked, but I would still encourage you to go speak to someone about it. It was, imaginably, a traumatic event as well.

You also mention in your edit that you have thoughts, but not the intention of killing yourself. The mere mention of thoughts of self-harm worries me, because this is how it started out with my SO, which is why I am encouraging you to seek help.

Please don't take my two cents the wrong way. If I'm being honest, after everything I've been through with my SO, I'm damaged in some way as well. I'm just looking out for a stranger, that's all."
du66kui,ippikinoookami,"I know you didn't. Neither did I, but I have no idea why I tried to jump off the kitchen window.

You can pm me if you want to talk. I'm stupid at talking/comforting ppl, but at least you can rant at me :3"
du4o351,plumpig,"Okay, I'm not an expert so take everything I say with a pinch of salt. I can only tell you what I know from experience. 

If they wanted to detain you, they would already have. When you go for your interview, you'll very likely be taken into a room to give your statement (if you have not yet given one). Once that's done, depending on what they want, they'll either close the investigation loop, or tell you to go home and that they'll call you again once investigations are done. If it's the latter, you'll then just wait for them to contact you again. But seriously, I really can't see this ending up with anything other than a stern warning for you.

"
du4nu9i,tomatomater,"Yeah I saw your other reply too. Sounds like a rather strange series of events to me tbh but it's probably personal so I shan't ask. Like what the other guy said, I think it's pretty stupid that (attempted) suicide is criminalised. Hopefully the police case side of things get settled without being too much of a hindrance to you."
du5mv60,Psynomia,Penknife and knife... ok just go and they probably just want to monitor your condition

du4tgn1,stephaniechuuu,I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.  :)
du6fo5c,,"no, I am not insinuating that you are lying. on the contrary, I feel sympathetic for you guys. It must be a very scary and traumatic experience. I think I heard the nurse whisper that it might be a police case, but no police interviewed me and I am curious....like was it because I was deemed out of touch with reality or something? and did cgh have no beds that's why you had to go imh? idk....I tried to jump off the bed and my ankle swelled up, then I was too weak to move, so I could not put up a strong resistance against going to imh....in the end I went on a stretcher.
edit: in fact I am very scared to attempt suicide again, as it might become a police case, or I might have to stay in imh for a very long time."
du4q7t8,stephaniechuuu,Corrected. 
du5kyvl,stephaniechuuu,"""I panicked."""
du5zaet,hhlim18,Yup. That's why it needs to be illegal to gave police the justification to stop you. It needs to be criminalized. Should police charge you or not is another issue all together.
du5m7qm,hhlim18,It may be new to you but they don't investigate your missing items. They only file a report for you. No follow up nothing. Don't believe me next time go call police when you misplaced your house keys.

I've had thoughts since I was 13 but I'm still here,  nearly 7 years later and my psychologist says it's okay to have those thoughts,  just don't act on them so.... 

You sound like my boyfriend.  Lmao.  "

I'll take you up on that. "
du4o8mu,stephaniechuuu,Thank you for your input! I've already given my statement when they arrested me and kept me in a holding cell for a night.  So I suppose this is most likely to close the investigation loop?

Why aren't you considering? That's because deep down you know it isn't their duty. What is their duty exactly? To enforce and maintain the law! If suicide isn't part of the law police will have to treat suicide like how they treat your misplaced keys. Do you want that?

I suppose it's after the IO talks to me that they send me to the hospital. Another lady who was arrested for the same offence was in the holding cell with me so I think perhaps it's procedure. "
du6a17t,stephaniechuuu,You don't know that for sure unless you are in the specific individual's head.  Everyone has different thought processes. 
du6q0i5,Feelgoodfood,"They do have a psychiatric wing in the integrated building. It's where I go to for my psych appointments but it's without beds! When I went down last year because I felt unsafe with myself (note: this was not a suicide attempt), the a&e doc told me they didn't have a designated psych ward and referred me to IMH, to which I vehemently said no to. Took a lot of convincing to escape that one. I remember having to sign some indemnity form saying that the hospital was not liable for me leaving against the doctor's wishes. :/ Perhaps things have changed since then!

du6ag8s,,"No it's documented as a statistically effective mechanism. I can't be arsed sourcing it but I recall watching a presentation on suicide prevention at my wife's school and the key message was to try to intervene so as to delay the decision.  Of course your a Singaporean so you have your own world view but the science of psychology has taught us one thing for sure and that's that we are not all special unique snowflakes but basically socialised trained herd animals with a lot in common between each of us.

My absolutely serious takeaway for anyone in this thread is that if faced with someone contemplating suicide to talk, visit, call, interfere with their plans. Its not a life time commitment. In the two cases I personally have been involved in, one took a 5 minute call to her family to go and talk to her and the other I personally called the guy and spoke to him. Both of them are still alive. Just do something. Nothing shits me off more than seeing suicides here where bystanders aren't stepping in to talk to the poor person."
du7gb6u,,"Yea perhaps this is the case.  Woah, my parents wouldn't sign the indemnity form and i could not sign it. I think i better not overthink on stuff, makes my head hurt...like when nuh said they had no beds, thought they were making excuses. Cause i am a difficult patient, very verbally combative."
du65gjx,Shuutaro,"This is something anxiety does. Whether or not something actually happened, someone with severe anxiety would usually have something on their minds that can make them uncomfortable with confrontation, panicky or easily frightened. 


What they think about may not actually be anything bad, but it can be something that bothers them greatly; Say, forgetting whether the stove at home was switched off and there isn't anyone who could check for you while you're unable to return. In this example, this is a bad situation that happened, but people with anxiety would feel this with a lot more situations, like making phone calls, deciding what to eat or entering an elevator alone with a stranger.


It may sound silly to worry excessively over something that may not be real or negative to most people, but they are extremely real and potentially horrifying to the individual. If something drastic happens (like OP here, who had to face civilian figures of authority for some reason), the anxiety will be amplified and may drive someone to do something needlessly drastic because of fear.


Not trying to make a fool out of you, but I have friends who asks questions like how you did; Some people would find the way it was phrased to be rude. I didn't think you were trying to attack though, you seemed like you just wanted to know why OP did what she did and I can see why it would seem very unnecessary to some. My parents would certainly see it that way. "

du62pc4,stephaniechuuu,Thank you. 
du5zk85,hhlim18,I know it isn't your intention to kill yourself but if you're won't handcuffs you and giving you bruise save your life? Without criminalizing what justification do police have? Should police be allowed to handcuff non-crime case?
du60ion,gmdotes,"a ""chapter"" refers to a particular statute. in this case, the Police Force Act is Cap (Chapter) 235.

perhaps you should look @ s 4(2), which lays out the duties of the Police Force, and in particular:

> (j)	disseminating information to and advising the public and conducting prosecutions;

> (k)	taking action for the safe custody of lost property and for the disposal of unclaimed property;

> (m)	protecting persons from injury or death, and public property from damage or loss, whether arising from criminal acts or in any other way;

the first one has nothing to do with offences, but rather providing information to the public.

the second is about lost stuff, which I mentioned.

and the last...wouldn't you say preventing suicide falls under protecting persons from injury or death?"
du6bhbk,,"I honestly think every human feels truly suicidal at some point for various reasons in their life.

Statistics is the basis of this tactic I. E. If it works for a lot of cases it is a reasonable thing to try. "
du60pvx,stephaniechuuu,I honestly rather they treat suicide like how they treat my misplaced keys than what it currently is. 
du60wdm,hhlim18,If you are quoting cap 235 sections 4(2) are police enforcing the law or facilitating as you've mention earlier? That section is too vague and could cover anything imaginable. I.e. preventing me from falling sound like protecting person(me) from injury or death. What does it really means and what does it refer too requires a lawyer to interoperate it. 
du6bnr0,stephaniechuuu,"I disagree with that statement. Some people go through life cherishing every day, never wanting to die. 

You are still wrong to say suicidal people do not actually want to die. "
du615wm,hhlim18,For you yes but what about family members of people who wanted to commit suicide? They would have hope police or someone is there to assist. 
du62zwd,gmdotes,"I'm not a lawyer yet, so if you're not willing to take my word for it..."
du6c958,,Yes perhaps there are. Yes for certain some suicidal people do want to die. My point is that anyone and everyone has a proven effective way to help their friend or family member or stranger not kill themselves and that is to intervene and interfere. 
du62mt4,stephaniechuuu,And further aggravate the person by letting them be treated by a criminal in a holding cell and thrown unnecessary comments by tactless police officers?  No thanks. 
du6kp1q,hhlim18,"I'm not a lawyer too, but I've serve ns as police. I have never seen anyone arrested or detained based on that section you've mention. The chapter we use is 224. Maybe you can share case law of when this section is being use. I can see it being abused the shit out of."

du7e3tf,,Fair enough
du7vn92,,Incidentally I think you are caught up in a protocol driven investigation. This means that because you were holding a knife a certain type of protocol (physical as well as paper work oriented) is followed. Never get between a Singaporean and a Rule. 
cga31lo,krysjez,"*Disclaimer: I am neither a medical nor social work professional, just a student with an interest in clinical psychology.*

I don't know you, but I'm really glad you reached out. You don't have to keep suffering. I have never used professional resources in Singapore, but I know that they exist, and some of them at least must be helpful. So here we go.

First: **If you ever find yourself starting to make plans for harming yourself (e.g. self-injury, suicide etc.), call Samaritans of Singapore at 1800-221 4444. I promise you that life is worth living, even if it doesn't seem so at that point. I know that when you're in the darkness and struggling to keep afloat it doesn't seem like there's anything which could possibly help - but trust me, things DO get better.**

Now, moving on...SOS also offers counselling services, even through email; never used them, but give it a shot -- http://www.samaritans.org.sg/services/hotline.htm

I would point you towards school counsellors, but you mentioned work so I don't think you're in school...? I did a little bit of research on this topic last year, actually, and here's an email I dug out:

> We usually charge an hourly fee of $20 if you are not working.  Our website is www.counsel.org.sg and you can get more information about our Centre and the services we offer before making a decision to see one of our therapists.    We usually recommend 3-4 sessions to feel you are being helped.  Ours is on a fortnightly basis. 
>  
> You are at liberty to stop sessions whenever you want to – even after one session if you assess that your issue for the moment is resolved or you won’t find it helpful if you were to continue.

Oogachaga also offers counselling at $60/hr - they have couples/family sessions for $80/hr. If you let them know that you have trouble paying I believe they will offer lower rates. I'm not sure how related this is to your problems, but they also ""operate a free hotline specialized in dealing with LGBTQ issues as well. Thus, you may call 6226 2002 to reach any of our hotline volunteers. Our hotline operates on Tue, Wed & Thur, from 7p.m. to 10p.m. and on Sat from 2p.m. to 6p.m.""

The hospitals also have psychiatry departments with clinicians. I don't know how much they charge. A friend of mine sees someone at NUH, I think. I would suggest your intake appointment be with a psychiatrist, just so that they can determine if you might be better helped by medication in addition to therapy/counselling.

I feel you on the cost thing - it's ridiculous that such an essential service costs so much. I would suggest you always try to explain your situation - counselling is social work after all, and I know that many therapists see clients on a sliding scale based on how much they can afford. So explain that you have limited funds and see how they respond.

Something about time, though: therapy 'hours' are usually 45-50 minutes long (at least in the US where I have more experience with this) so you might not have to leave work as early as you think.

The most helpful thing I've encountered in mental health is to **be kind to yourself**. Recovery takes time, like recovering from any other illness - and it's a slow process, and there will be times when it feels like you've taken one step forwards and two steps back. So be kind to yourself. And keep us posted. (Another helpful thing: keeping track of your progress, especially during counselling. Writing, in general, is good - as long as you don't do it too much and go into what's called ""depressive rumination"" [google it])

One last word regarding freezing up - I know EXACTLY what that's like. When I first decided to finally try and talk to people (out loud, not online) about feeling down, I would open my mouth and try really hard and literally *nothing* would come out and I would feel so frustrated...I know it's terrifying sometimes to have to talk and explain yourself. That's fine. Opening up is hard, and it takes practice. 

Oh! Another thing: if your therapist isn't actually helpful and there's no improvement after 4-ish sessions, or you're consistently leaving sessions feeling worse than when you came in, feel free to ask for a referral and change. They won't be offended, and you won't be wasting money with someone who isn't helping you get better.

I really hope you find something that works for you. Feel free to message me with follow-up.

^small ^monologue: ^TBH ^I ^have ^sometimes ^considered ^going ^back ^to ^school ^in ^the ^future ^for ^a ^psych ^or ^social ^work ^degree ^just ^so ^that ^I ^can ^do ^something ^to ^improve ^the ^inaccessibility ^of ^mental ^health ^resources ^in ^Singapore ^(well, ^any ^place ^could ^benefit ^from ^more ^counsellors, ^but ^it's ^particularly ^evident ^in ^Asia ^due ^to ^cultural ^things ^imo)

P.S. I have heard rumor that counsellors from certain organizations try to push religious views on their clients. If you encounter one like this, unless you're of the same faith and being able to discuss that is actually helping you, **run**."
cgaihf4,mouseytung,"Given cost is an issue, I would agree with quietowlet's suggestion to get a referral from the polyclinic. They may refer you either to IMH or a satellite clinic.  As s/he points out, getting to the head of the queue may take some time, so remember to mention your thoughts of self-harm.

While you're waiting, your local family service centre (Comcare helpline can help connect you - 18002220000) may be able to provide support. Services are usually free/low cost.

If things get to a point that you think you might act on your thoughts to hurt yourself, walk into IMH A&E.  They are open 24/7.  Mention to the MO along the way that you'll need the MSW to help. How much they are able to assist will depend on your particular circumstances.

Finally, kudos for getting help.  Unfortunately, as others have observed, not every professional helper is going to be right for everyone.  You may have to be persistent to get the help that you need.  Best wishes for your recovery!"
cga8b2z,PostalElf,"Your symptoms are textbook bipolar disorder, formerly known as maniac-depressive disorder because your up phases are known as ""maniac"" while your down phases are ""depressive"".  Many great people have suffered from bipolarity, especially those who are artistically inclined: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_bipolar_disorder

Yes, you _should_ see someone professionally.  However, it's not easy to do so in Singapore, especially if cost is an issue.  A good start may be simply to just start opening up to some of your friends, especially those who have a history of being good listeners without a need to jump in with inane, dismissive comments every other sentence.  You don't have to get to the root of the problem in these initial sessions: just say that you've been not really feeling yourself these days, that something's out of sorts, that you just want someone to talk to, and see how they react.  If they seem open and willing to listen, see if you can talk about it, in a roundabout peripheral way.

Of course, not everyone is blessed enough to have such friends.  If things get really bad, consider just going to a polyclinic and asking a doctor for a referral or some other options.  Most medical doctors should have protocol and procedure that they follow when they see a patient with mental problems, and they may be able to point you in the right direction.

Finally, don't feel ashamed that you have this problem.  You're most certainly not alone.  In fact, if anything you're in illustrious company, as the wikipedia page will tell you.  Seeking help for this condition is no more shameful than going to the doctor because you have a cold: it's no more or less a medical condition than a flu.  Chin up!  Life gets better."
cgacygh,quietowlet,"I was treated for depression some time back. Private wasn't cheap, I was paying close to $200 a session which is really painful when you're going twice a month. I don't really know if his fees were considered cheap or expensive or average though.

When I was on the way to a relapse, I went with IMH. It's around $30 with subsidy. Since cost is a big factor, you might want to consider this, but it will take time before you can schedule an appointment (it was a month's wait for me). Make sure you get referral from a polyclinic. You can get an appointment without a referral, but it's going to be more expensive."
cgc37uj,,"Sorry to hear about your problems. 

As someone here suggested, get yourself to a polyclinic asap, tell the doctor how you feel and say want a referral to imh, the polyclinic will liaise with imh to fix an appointment for you.

Once at imh, you'll speak to the equivalent of a general doctor there first and be given a diagnosis before being matched to a particular clinic to treat you.

I think such a consultation at imh will only set you back $30+

All the best!"
cga29h2,junnies,you might try reading eckhart tolle's material (you can get his ebooks for free through torrents and there is plenty of free material on the internet either way). he is a 'spiritual' writer but i know from personal experience that reading his material has helped me with my psychological issues tremendously.
cgac5eu,tmit41,"Thank you for so much info and advice! Yes, I'm working now, not in school. I tend to.. ruminate a lot, which in my 'down' states, makes things really bad on a personal level.

The main reason why I have trouble opening up to people is because when face-to-face with other people, I tend to seem okay. Call it a mask if you will, but when I saw a counseller he thought I might be faking. Either that or I'm paranoid, reading too much into him sighing and rolling his eyes. It really stung me and I never sought any help since. "
cga917y,krysjez,"I just wanted to pop in and say that I don't think OP provided nearly enough information for a bipolar diagnosis, even an informal one given over the internet.

cgac7m3,tmit41,"My friends all have troubles of their own.. I'd feel as if I'm burdening them if I opened up to them. I know it sounds silly but I'm the kind of person to not want to trouble others just for my own sake.

cga34aa,krysjez,"while we're on book recommendations, david richo's ""how to be an adult"" is a deceptively slim volume that contains lots of good stuff. It gets a bit wishy-washy/""everything is due to childhood trauma"" at some points, but the rest is rock. solid."
cgad2te,krysjez,"Then he was a shitty counsellor. They exist, unfortunately. But not all counselors are shitty! Some are actually awesome!When you notice yourself ruminating, stop and try to bring your attention back to the present, notice how you are feeling, the sounds in your ears, the sensation of breathing. When you are calm enough open your eyes again and mentally put the thing you were ruminating on away. I find standing up and physically engaging in something else e.g. cleaning really helps.Look into cognitive behavioral therapy. Fancy name for a simple concept. There are articles online you can read. (but don't read too much about psych at one go; there's a reason professionals undergo a decade of training. It's easy to self-diagnose and get more upset, because so much clinical psych seems ""obvious"" or like common sense)"
cgad3wl,krysjez,"Also, I think the mask is something hard to overcome initially. Try writing down how you feel and bring it along. You might not actually say any of it but it will be a useful way to get used to the idea of bringing these negative thoughts to session."
cgacdf1,PostalElf,"If they are real friends, they wouldn't mind.  Think about it: would you think poorly of your friend if they came to you with a problem like this?  Or would you feel honoured and glad that they trusted you enough to be able to open up and share something so personal and intimate with you?

Everyone has problems, which is why we have friends.  We joke that a Singaporean's #1 pastime, outside of eating, is complaining while eating, but we do it because it helps.  Find a friend, someone you can trust, and see if talking about it helps.  If not, then forget about it: find another alternative solution, see a doctor, see a psychologist or counsellor, whatever.  If it does, however, then you're good."

To not actively study hard, and instead spend my days naively thinking that everything will be ok if I start using my brain. My mind is stagnant now, not quite what it used to be. My grades when I graduated... my capabilities, aren’t really existent when I got my degree.

To not be more flexible. I was conditioned to be a rather inflexible person (family issues), unable to adapt well to different environments. This has caused me to be socially impaired, and has limited my capabilities.

Last but not least, to put on my headphones. To drown the world out, not listening, refusing to acknowledge it, and simply looking at it from a haughty perspective. I declined many opportunities, simply dismissing them as bullshittery which I did not need. Scholarships? Don’t bother applying. Studies? Why would I want to be a neurotypical? Such denial, over the years, have accumulated into quite a lot of damage done to my life. I have no memories of having moments with friends, nothing much to talk about either.

dtpejnk,Koufas,"1. I regret throwing myself into every single program/opportunity available while I was in JC. Both outside and inside of school

2. Getting pressured into applying for US uni when i didnt want to

Sure it has shaped me and allowed me to grow into the person who I am today.

But I was also depressed, overworked, and too stressed out for my own good. I have a problem saying no. Join debates again even though I had already wanted to leave the scene to make up for 3 man team? Yeah ok why not. Hi can you join us in this math competition? Ok sure thing bro, anything for a friend. Hi can you help us emcee our CCA concert? Yeah alright i love doing it anyway

With so many commitments. I had to force myself to study for a week before promos in J1. I had already skipped midyears so everything would be weighted on promos.

By the time J1 was over I knew I burnt out. But it was too late to back out tbh. I had already made too many commitments that would carry over to the next year. Everyday in April and May I went home past 10pm due to rehearsals/preparation for competitions/competitions/external workshops

To compensate I studied from 8-8 for a month before Prelims in July, then after a week break studied from 8 to past 10 in school everyday. On weekends Id go to the library or en empty CCA room in my secondary school. 

Burnt out. Wasnt fun. Didnt have time to myself to enjoy what I wanted to do.

2. I also got caught up being pressured by all my teachers to apply to a foreign Uni. Did my SATs for $110, applied to 4 unis for $80 each halfheartedly knowing that if i didnt get a scholarship that I didnt really want I wouldnt be able to afford it.

I chickened out of applying for the scholarship due to my indecisiveness but I had already applied for the unis. The worst part was that I had actually gotten accepted into Yale. But I didnt tell anyone that I rejected it for SMU because everyone would question and question and I just didnt want people to know that I wasted all of my parents and teachers and mentors time trying to apply to a foreign Uni to only reject it. My parents are getting old so I wanted to stay at home. But more than that I cant let them pay for my uni fees either. Its insanely more than we are able to afford including accomodation and food. Felt easier to just say I got rejected from everything instead of the full story.

And out of the full lecture room of people apparently applying to US unis from my JC.

I know of less than 10 who actually went to apply.

I have had many regrets, mostly due to my rash nature what with my ADHD and lack of self-awareness to cope with it (I mean even my parents refused to let me see a psych till I was in JC because they always thought I was just making excuses to be lazy)

Here are some of the main ones

1) not pressuring my parents into letting me get help for my ADHD sooner. Parents: if your child is telling you to let them see a psychiatrist something is usually very wrong and you are probably too blind/disbelieving to see it. Cos of it I couldnt get help for my annoying behaviour and consistent lack of focus early and my early school life was not the greatest

2) not transferring to a different primary school. The all-boys primary school I went to had a culture that rejected my type of person and I have a feeling that a change of environment would have been immensly helpful in shaping who I was and am

3) not applying for sst or any enrichment programs in my secondary school. As i had/still have a deep interest in doing cool things for the sake of doing cool things for fun SST's curriculum wouldve helped me kickstart my venturing into learning things like programming and robotics early. Similar goes for secondary school enrichment programs but more for biotech stuff

4) screwing up the Band SYF in secondary school. Cant really say much more lest I dox myself more than I already have but lets just say I played when I didnt have to for which I still cant explain why and fked things up for everyone. We got a silver that year and I still have nightmares about it to this day

5) Not going on the japanese exchange trip with the band. Going to japan last year really opened my eyes to the concept of culture, respect and doing things for the sake of tradition, concepts I could never really grasp till then. If I had gone back when I was still early in secondary school maybe I wouldnt have continued being such a shithead

6) being a cunt to female classmates when I was in lower sec. After 6 years surrounded my guys I was pretty freaked out interacting with females my age back in sec 1 and people knew that. So there was this joke where people shipped me and this random girl that apparently said she liked me or something but somehow I came to the conclusion to act like shit towards her. Yeah I also get cringy nightmares about this

7) not taking physics in secondary school. I had quite a but of interest in physics, heck I study it in my spare time nowadays but back then a bad experience with a science teacher in lower sec caused me to not take physics back then and I instead took bio. Regret it quite a bit cos I had to then learn everything on my own time in addition to mugging bio which was the main reason for my name

8) not joining a sports cca in primary school. I distinctly remember I used to be an active person who enjoyed running but my parents never really had the time to take me outdoors and I just settled into a sedentary lifestyle before primary school. However in primary school I had 2 distinct opportunities to be in sports ccas I enjoyed : Tennis and softball. However I quit tennis for who knows what stupid reason and I was too lazy/scared to look for the teacher in charge of softball. Now here I am learning softball independently and trying my damndest to try and becoming healthy again

Dammit Im only 18 and yet I have made too many regrets, many of which still keep me awake at night or send me into panic attacks but I guess theyre better than simple lack of initiative as I can still learn from them :/"

2. Didn't have the courage to ask my crush out back in poly, was like waiting till we graduated. The next thing I knew, she was happily attached, while I am still the same old me.

3. Joined UG in secondary school, but the inefficiency of my teachers and constant hammering of administrative task onto me caused me to lost my passion for the CCA, and turned me to be a power hungry person.

dtr50n7,PenguinMyouina37,"This ^. I definitely agreed with what you said. Which is why I do not want to go into Uni because I don't think it will be helpful in what I want to do in the future.

I also have a similar experience, being forced to go into a poly course with ""business"" on it due to family pressure. Throughout the 3 years, I would be lying if I said I didn't learn any useful skills. But I just didn't enjoy it. 3 years felt like 3 decades. I'm just glad the next week will be end of my internship. The past 3 years have been a depressive struggle as well. Seeing how people my age are doing what they enjoy, while I'm stuck in my poly classes doing FYP for 95% of the time(going back to school from Mon to Sat).

I feel like I have missed out a lot, not being able to invest the time in something that I truly love.

So yes, I agree with what you mentioned: Don't feel pressured to do something you know you won't do in the end."

I'm from a 'low tiered' JC myself and yeah I get how you feel because I've personally heard some pretty nasty comments about my JC such as 'rejects of XJC' (the JC that is nearest to mine that had a lower COP last year', 'slacker JC' etc etc. At the end of the day, JC is a stepping stone for university and therefore, which uni you go to should be the end goal, and not which JC you are in, because its your attitude that matters."
dtpq3yk,YipJK,"I'm in one myself. 

Though I would admit the culture and attitude around studying is terrible, especially among my classmates, and the teachers just seem useless in comparison to other schools, the school doesn't determine who you will become. 

I'm from Yishun JC, I went in with an L1R5 of 12. (Personally I blame the jae system, and ya i tried appeal, but I guess I just got unlucky.) But even here, there are people how excel, take my friend that takes H3 Econs, TDP or me that take MEP. 

All I will add is your O levels and school don't make you. And don't force yourself to study, run after something. It could be your dream job, your inspiration, or a guy/girl. "

dtpcl4i,OneScrewLoose_,"Ditto this. I never practised back then, and didn't do the homework assigned. Mum ended up asking the piano teacher to punish me, so I was getting weekly punishments for a period of time.

I stopped one day by just saying ""i don't want to learn piano already! "" right before I was supposed to leave home for piano lessons, and then that was the end of my piano journey!  "

daei4mg,nova9001,"Sorry to say that you can't magically give a person purpose in life. That is the one thing that everyone needs but everyone needs to find on their own.

From your description of your mother now and previously, she probably suffers from some mental condition (depression, anxiety, confusion). You need to seek some medical help in identifying it. To 'take care' of your parents is a huge burden and there is no room for half-ass effort so I urge you to consider seriously if you want to get involved.

With the proper help I think your mother's condition would improve (much effort and time required on your part). However, this is also related to what you want to do in life. Most important thing is to reduce the amount of regrets you have there is just no way to do everything.

If you do not feel like helping your mother overcome her issues, you can help your brother. Talk to him often, make sure he isn't stressed or depressed. If the environment is stressful or abusive he could end up with mental issues as well.

I feel blessed as my parents are doing everything for me and I have never had such issues even while working now. I hope everything works out well for your family."
daejqwm,xiangusk,"She has depression and perhaps some anxiety. I think you should help your brother if you can.  

If your father can take over the care of your brother, it will be better for your brother's mental health. I would also suggest that your brother and you seek some professional help because her attitudes will manifest and follow you into your adult life.

If she is threatening suicide, please report it to the police for handling. (Suicide attempts are illegal.) If she follows through it is not your fault. YOu will need to slowly disconnect her from your life to properly heal. We have choices. If you want to help her, you could alert her church pastor and inform him before hand you will not help her in any other way. 

Side note: FYI $6 is not a lot of money for tuition and 2 instruments and household bills. Especially if you live in a condo and not managing the expenditures because of depression or anxiety. "
daejr3t,ztyk,"The church seems to be the first place you can start, have you considered contacting them since your mom spends time with them? 

I have no idea how churches work but maybe a person of influence within it can find your mom some activities to just get her outside and breathing and living for a start. If you share SOME of your concerns with them, they may be willing to help you. 

Cheers, friend. Congratulations on Uni. I'm an NTU scholar myself, pm me if we have anything in common."
daeoarc,jinhong91,You can lead a horse to water but you can't force the horse to drink it. 
dagcgif,dungalot,"Glad to hear you made it out. It is never easy to leave a toxic home, especially when you've lived in it for almost all your life- for better or worse you'll always carry some of its poison within you. But now that you're out, it will never be able to eat you alive the way it would have if you were still stuck in that miasma. Never go back. Love does not mean wasting away together.

About your mother, there is little you can do to help her find a new purpose in life. You can think of her like an empty glass filled to the brim with the toxic thoughts and emotions that have been eating away that your family for years. For her to find new purpose, she will first have to pour away those thoughts, the anger and blame towards your father, and her fixation on having absolute control over the events and people in her life.

You cannot fill her with purpose when she is already full of resentment and unhappiness. There is no space in her heart or mind for your intentions, no matter how good. And although she doesn't necessarily have to pour everything bad away to find space for good, there would be an inevitable corrupting influence if she persists in holding on to those toxic thoughts. It will warp any positive changes in her life to feed the negative, and that is meaningless to you as her daughter.

Again my advice to you would be the same. Love and support your Mother as far as you can, without being consumed by her. You do not have to accept the things that she does, but accept her for better or worse and find it in your heart to love her as she is. There is little you can do to change her at this point save dragging her by force to a doctor. And that may not necessarily bring positive change as is the problem with mental disorders- the patient has to participate out of their own free will rather than feigning compliance just to better manipulate the good intentions of loved ones. She has to make the choice for herself or it will never work.

As for your brother, communicate with him, daily if possible. When you were there to share the burden with him, he could have a moment or two to breathe. But now that he is alone there, there is no rest from her overwhelming influence. 

Humans are not made to function under constant pressure, and everyone has a breaking point. Having someone to talk to, and share the burden relieves the pressure a little, and that puts off the boiling point for a little longer. So talk with him (ask him about his day, how he is coping, and if he is doing ok), and if he is receptive, encourage him to talk with your Dad as well. 

There is nothing like the relief of knowing you have someone (financially AND emotionally) stable to rely on when things go bad. Now more than ever, you have to remind him that there is someone who CAN and WILL catch him when he falls. Do not let him get sucked in too deep, or to forget that he has other family he can rely on. 

It can be terrifying to feel like you're the only one holding things together, that sort of fear can paralyse you and stop you from verbalising your own personal problems out of fear that everything around you will collapse if you show one bit of weakness. He is just a kid, and shouldn't feel like he has the world on his shoulders. Remind him that he is just that- a kid, and that he can and should find help if he really needs it (even if it isn't from you or your dad) rather than trying to bottle everything up.

Nothing more I can add, but I hope things work out for you and your brother. Everyone has their own respective lives to live, if you (or your brother) suspend your lives to allow your mother's to continue, in a way you are killing yourself to let her lead her's. That is no answer either.

Regrets abound either way, a wasted life is the result at either end. However both you and your brother's cups are still empty enough to be filled with something better, and her's is way too full to be receptive to anything else. There is no blame for whatever choice you make, and imo the desire to live your own life is not something that a mother should ever punish her child for having."

Basically dont let him loose hope.
Talk to your brother often and be the mom he never had. Praise him when he does well, help him when he needs help, be there for him. Stay close to him and let him see that there is a good life for him when he is older. Invite him to your place now and then too if that is possible and let him feel what family life should be even.

Yea try not to make your mother jump to her death but your long term priority should always be the well being of your brother.  But of course if you feel like suicide is getting serious you should never have to feel like you are in a situation where you have to choose who is going to jump to their death, that is not your responsibility. If so, contact authorities like police or those social workers."
daevzz1,Linwenshang,"I just read thru your previous post.

Honestly speaking, there is nothing much u can do about ur mum. Her current state is a result of years of slight mental instability or depression and habits. I think u should focus on ur brother and urself.

First of all, staying in campus gives u more freedom and less room for tension, this might help improve ur relationship with ur mum if you do go back home once awhile. Just endure the short stay at home and try to please her when u are back. One important thing is make sure that you are eligible for hall stay in the next following years. Not sure u are in ntu or nus but most halls require u to participate in activities in order to stay next yr. Also rmb to make friends in hall so that you got company and emotional support. Although i understand it would be hard to talk to ur frens about this issue, but maybe one day u will get a fren that is close enough to share this burden.

Next, do talk to ur brother more often, thru phone or whatsapp so that he wont feel that he is alone in this demise while his sister has left him for ""safety"". I worry alot about his emotional state, as his current age is most susceptible to bad influence. Especially if he found accompany with a wrong group fren outside. And try to find opportunity for ur brother to attending boarding school. This would be better than ask him to seek refuge from ur dad. Although this might take away one of the remaining emotional support for ur mum. But i think having a church would still provide sufficient spiritual support. As both u and ur brother has and is experiencing the same situation, dun be afraid to open up more to each other about how u feel about the state of the family and ur mother. (not sure how close u are woth ur brother) Anyway, ur brother is old enough to has his own opinion on the issue so do listen to how he feels about it.

"
daf8cf0,casa_vagalumi,"Good on you for overcoming what you have and doing well in your studies. First of all, you are not alone. You're dealing with a lot for a young person and it is important to take care of yourself so you don't burn out or manifest deeper issues later on in life in your own relationships and marriage. For now, focus on you. Get counseling for yourself. See a professional who can reflect back to you in a healthy and supportive way so you can find mental and emotional balance and not have to put on a tough front all the time as a scholar and a big sister. It is very important that you do this, and pm me if you need help getting connected with some resources. 

Hoarding is an epidemic also in Singapore, the materialism and culture of competition and lack, zero sum mindsets, all promote this so much that many times it is not even acknowledged as a serious issue. Maybe your or your mum's purpose in life is to ultimately create support groups for recovering hoarders or liberate is all from the traps of material possessions, I don't know, and you are right because in this whole challenge therein lies your purpose and destiny. So seek it out and be patient with yourself. Small steps and little battles. Go easy on yourself, don't put so much pressure on having to get straight As because by golly you have a lot to deal with. And have fun and relax as much as you can. When your mother sees you thriving and relaxed she will begin to relax also. Maybe not anytime soon but people do mellow out as they age. Hope is on your side. 

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your journey. I trust you have friends who will be understanding and nonjudgmental about your family. Life is a struggle and difficult for everyone so try not to take things so seriously. All the best to you and your family."

d539837,,"Hi OP, it's not your fault. None of this is happening because of you.

Apart from OCD, has she been diagnosed with any other mental illnesses? It sounds like she suffers from manic episodes, and a fair amount of paranoia. Note: I'm not trying to diagnose her, just pointing out what I think based on the behaviors you described.

I recommend bringing her to a mental health professional for assessment, if you can. With her behavior and all, I don't think it would be a great idea to bring this up to her, so you might have to get the police involved and tell them everything that has been happening. I doubt there would be legal repercussions, but just make sure that when they're involved, tell them you'd like to get help for her. There's an A&E in IMH, which you can bring her to in an ambulance (in restraints, if necessary).

Lastly, please take care of yourself. If you require any assistance, there's a [sticky](https://redd.it/3emoe3) over in /r/SGKindness you should check out."
d53gro2,Hope83,"I am nearly sure she's suffering from some mental disorder. From what you have described, it may well be that she's suffering from psychosis.

Here's a link to help find your nearest social service office. https://app.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/sso/default.aspx  

Please do it asap, she's not only a danger to you and your family, she's also a danger to herself. I hope everything works out well for your family. If you need anyone to talk to, there are many hotlines you can reach out to for help. Don't give up, please. Keep fighting. We're here for you.  

Here's a hotline if you need someone to talk to: 1800 221 4444. Their website: https://sos.org.sg/"
d5523sv,Hope83,"I posted earlier yesterday but mostly just a short reply. Now that I have more time, I'll give you a more detailed response.

In all your post, you did not mention about your mum. Your dad's depression condition and his passive attitude towards the situation strikes across to me that your mum is no longer in your family's life, be it physically or emotionally somehow. I could be wrong but that's what I'm sensing.

I am more concerned about you than your sister. For your sister, the issue is simply a matter of getting her professional/medical help, ie. seeing a psychiatrist and getting meds. As I advised earlier, if your dad isn't willing to do anything due to finance issues or whatever, you should approach a social worker at the nearest Family Service Centre and ask for counsel on this situation. Alternatively as /u/muachee has mentioned, go to SAMH (Singapore Association of Mental Health) and seek help there. 

But when it comes to you, you mentioned that you dropped out of JC. You sound like you are trying to retake A levels as a private candidate from your post. You mentioned that you have no one to talk to. This is not good. You need to have friends who can be there for you and support you. With all that's happening at home, the last thing you should be doing is to close yourself off trying to fend for life on your own. *You are not alone*

You have already taken the courage to seek help here. Go one step further, help yourself, get support so that you can walk this world with a more emotionally stable footing. 

My offer still stands. If you need a listening ear or support to walk you through this period of time, you are always welcomed to drop me a message."
d53rws3,,"Hi OP,  Agree with other posters, this sounds like paranoia and psychosis. Had experience with mentally ill family member with similar psychotic episode. Strongly suggest getting her into IMH for treatment cos it sounds serious. She could be a danger to others or herself. 

Here's what I know from personal experience. 

You can call 1777 for non emergency ambulance to your house to take her to IMH's A&E. Emphasise the fact that she's physically hurting your family members and yourself so there's a danger. Ambulance staff will try to persuade her first but if not they will physically restrain her (strap her on stretcher etc) if she keeps being violent. 

If she's likely to turn violent or refuse to open the door, you need to get police involved to help. I didn't need to get police, but got some other relatives to ""act"" as if they are visiting the house. Mentally ill family member opened the door to let them in and BAM. It took some trickery or persuasion to get them to go without a struggle, including we had to act along with their hallucination. YMMV. 

There is a law that allow you to forcefully commit your family member who is mentally unsound for psychiatric treatment, if they refuse to do so. Not so sure about the finer details but your parents may need to be the ones instead of you. I didn't have to use it but I discussed it with IMH doctors on the possibility. My family member ended up being cooperative in staying in IMH after a while when the psychotic drugs started working. 

Singapore Association of Mental Health has a good helpline u can call for advice. I did that. They also have very good counselling and support services (support groups, advice) for family members who are affected by a loved one with mental illness. I used their support services a LOT and it was very helpful. Pls give them a try and persuade ur dad."

d53twoh,alkdsfhwig,"Hi OP, I'm also wondering the same thing. My brother has been unemployed for a long time. I think he has some mental issues. He just stays in his room and occasionally shouts early in the morning. 

The other day he threatened to kill me because of something I said. I couldn't sleep last night as well. I know I'm not as bad as you but I feel helpless too. I just try to work long hours and get out of the house. 

I think parents...they know something is wrong but some times they can't bring themselves to do anything about it which is the worse part. They try to think their child will ""snap out of it"". Like my dad, when my brother screams, he closes his room door and let's me and my mom get screamed at. Yar...I also wished he could die. But after I went to sleep, I don't feel that way so much anymore. 

I don't think you're flawed, you're just in a bad place. Especially since a home is supposed to be safe but you're threatened in there. I think getting out of the house: working night shift/working part-time would help.

Put your personal safety and well-being first, always. If you find that it's best to get her hospitalised for YOUR sanity and well-being, sure take the plunge. If having somewhere else to go where you can avoid her and siam far far is better for you in the short term, go ahead. 

It's very tough to have a family member who is mentally ill, especially when you are stuck in the same house and other family members kind of give up and don't want to do anything. Don't feel bad if you sometimes feel so desperate you just want to pack up and run away and never go back. Or if you just get so angry at your sister and also your dad. Or you doubt/blame yourself. It's a lot of complicated feelings. It is best to get some counselling for yourself to sort it out when you feel ready to open up. I heard that SAMH is able to offer some free/subsidized counselling if you really have financial difficulty, check with them if you get in touch.

I also want to encourage you that things do get better in the long run. Either you will be able to find the means to move out, avoiding her completely, or maybe sending her to IMH and treatment has some effect so things calm down at home. Many times I just wanted to run away from home cos I didn't feel like I could handle my family member and commit them to IMH. But they started being worse like running out in the middle of the night then disappearing for hours, throw their money away (literally) or nearly getting knocked down by traffic. Thats when I told myself I had to try the IMH and ambulance route. It was damn scary but few years later now? I am so glad I did it.

Mental illness treatment isn't like flu when you just pop a bunch of pills and recovers. Give it time... I believe you can survive this shit.

(Made some edits to clarify my points)"
d540stu,MelonApple2,hope OP takes you up on this and you doing a good thing mate. Cheers to you. 
d53jsqc,childrenofkingsman,Thank you for this.
d35acub,Gohster99,"Hi OP, you should definitely consider signing on with a govt ogn that is willing to fund your studies; since you have an offer letter from ntu and some extra math stuff to back up your credibility. The time it would take you to earn back the $$ you spend on a degree may not be ideal and you will also lose out on opp costs/earnings (working and studying as compared to loan and studying). An additional point is that a private degree is not bad at all, you just need to stand out - making the hard choices to support your family is a damn good one - often it counts for sth when you're being hired. I am a private uni (aussie) grad working for one of the largest tech American companies. Just my two cents worth."
d359dct,Klubeht,"Don't go to SIM if u can go to local uni. Yes u suffer in terms of losing on the part time income but once u graduate it will more than make up in terms of starting salary and more importantly the amount of opportunities that will be available to you regardless of what you study as long as its from a local uni like ntu...

Trust me I know having tried to compete against local uni ppl with a SIM degree..."
d359t44,swifterrr,"If you want to sign on, get the army to fund your full-time degree in a local university rather than signing on and doing part-time in SIM, because that degree can serve you better in the workforce imo. :)


if you not interested in signing on, taking a loan could be ok but the interest rates might be prohibitive. I think if you were able to secure a job before graduation, you won't have to worry too much."
d35amvg,keyboardsoldier,"You're good in math, so why not stick to it? With your math degree you can work in banks and other related fields."
d35bjcr,tictactorz,"Try speaking to your S1 regarding signing on and scholarships. Your OC as well. It's a bummer for wospecs because they don't offer scholarships but I know they allow wospecs to go pursue a degree as part of career advancements because I know a SSG who went to UNI and is still in the force as a MSG now.

With signing on in mind, try signing on as an officer for more benefits, or you could try going down the MDES path for engineering prospects if you are keen in that since you're stronger in mathematics. 

When I was contemplating, people told me to explore the other vocations but I stuck with my then vocation because it was already what I knew and had already been familiarized with. The other argument is that as an nsf you're stuck with your vocation for 2 years but as a regular you're stuck in it for the remaining 20-30+ years so you'll have to make a decision yourself because even with a short term contract you'll be stuck with it till you finish your service as an NSman.

Visit open houses to get more info! All the best!

d35bwx9,wiltedpop,at this point i hope you bank everything on your math skills. because its best prospect i can see
d35crqx,lauises,"Sign on doesn't mean you need to stay in military for life. Plenty of military folks move on to other completely different things. You have a challenging problem, deal with that first. When things get easier, you'll find a better and more fulfilling route =)"

d35987v,saperis,Sign on SPF. Problem solved.
d35wmdv,parttime_economist,"http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/financialaid/loans/financial-loans-nus-studyloan.html

Student debt in Singapore can be amortised over your whole working life, so please don't worry overmuch about the size of total debt. 

The terms and structure of Uni loans is meant to help people exactly in your situation.

Devote your energy and time in your first few years to industries which you are interested in. NUS, NTU and SMU are heavily invested in undergrad education - choose what fits your interests. And think about learning opportunities in SEA and North Asia. Your undergrad years and getting your first salary will be some of the best experiences of your life."
d35dc9v,myepicdemise,"What's important is that you do well academically in university. Since you're so good at math, then it's probably good for you to study math in the uni. Note that doing a technical subject opens you up to more opportunities than arts subject, and it gets even better if you can be the top student."
d360qvt,doc-tom,"If you want to know what the career prospects are like for people who go to NTU mathematical sciences, you can visit http://www.spms.ntu.edu.sg/mas/Career/RecruitmentGraduates.html to get an idea of what kind of jobs their graduates go into. 

Consider studying statistics in NTU. A good honours degee in statistics is highly regarded by many companies that need data analysts. Students from business schools just don't get that kind of training. "
d36yo4s,kyith,"When you are a student for 18 years and you did not focus outwardly too much, you tend not to see what matters. 

At 36 I have seen sign on officers and wose failed and I have seen sign on folks pivot to a great second career, or set themselves up so well their ord at 40++ do not matter much. 

My brother graduated from sim full time with a rather general degree in management in the worst employment period known in Singapore. One year he works contract at ntuc income earning 1600.

Now he is earning 7000, with good cash flow to manage a stable life. 

The degree is an entry point. If you cannot take a similar high paying job as a start, what is wrong with that? Are you not willing to work harder than the nus ntu grad to rank higher? 

Just accept the chance to prove yourself an learn what is important : the competency. If you get good your reputation develops. 

Future job depends on you reputation as a good worker, leader.  sometimes your starting base is low and you have to accept to work harder (or is that not what you want)

I work in a segment where we take in sim, private degree folks and ex regulars.  

Those who become managers became managers not because of their degree but how they seperate themselves. They have humility to learn, open to ideas, stoic. 

Those that move on enjoy great careers because they have a good rep and keep in touch with friends in the same industry or silo. 

To me if a degree is an entry point, sign on and a private degree is a great option because at 25 you end up without debt versus some local uni grad without support from parents. 

All these stuff does not matter so much if you do not manage your wealth well. If this area is new to you, you might eventually be chasing an income that burns you out. 

Your question should be sign on what vocation. 

Your question should be this is my ideal track: I want to sign on for 6 years come out, go into x industry doing this or this, critique my plan 

Your question should be how many of you start from a low salary and eventually end up well. What are the actions and reflections that impact the most "
d35ewjc,FaithFulStars,"But would it be worth it studying smth I'm good at but not interested in vs smth I'm int in? I'm pretty befuddled with life now :( esp since the opportunity costs are too much for me to manage since part of my aim is that I want to be able to not burden my parents and kind of pass them money every month, but if I take a full time degree not only will I suffer and I will not be able to help them much, and I might not like the subj, but for sim part time I'm afraid it will be tough getting a job in the future aft I graduate and then the part about full time degree pros will kick in, if the employment stuff for private degrees don't suffer so much as compared to suffering I take from signing on and going to sim, I think it's ok. But right now I don't have any first hand experience so it's hard to make a sound decision, but based on what u are saying and sharing I think I just got more info on what's life to come. Thank you!!"
d359nr9,FaithFulStars,I see what u mean.. what did u study in sim may I ask? But would there be such a discrepancy as well if for say I'm taking a degree that differs alot from what I prefer or envision to take
d359zn8,saperis,Only if TS is a officer who can qualify for LSA.

Your career should be pretty much secured.... just dont ooc"
d35eqju,FaithFulStars,"There is a problem regarding this which is that my rp for a levels are not very good, hence I can't get into a course of my choice in ntu/nus which is why I probably can't get a scholarship and also why I can't get the course of my liking. Also getting a full time degree would require me to translate back into the civilian life after min 7 years? 3 year uni 4 years bond, hence I'm pretty against it. Thanks for your suggestions though bro!! It broadens my horizon up!!"
d35f86h,FaithFulStars,"Sorry for being clueless but would a mathematical sciences or maybe math and econs degree get me to a decent paying job in the banking industry?

Thank you for your advice though sir!!"
d35fc7e,FaithFulStars,"I see! Not complaining but the point with cdo wospec are that they want u to sign on in cdo, but a temporary contract here is not worth it since u have to pass special forces + ranger.. but then again I'm pretty hyped on that too. But I would rather chill and have the time to study part time degree as compared to hiong ranger, I'm only interested in 3 years after my nsf life and nothing else, do you have any advice on which unit can best serve my needs? Do not get me wrong I'm keen on serving the nations but I feel that I need to fulfill my needs as well, of getting a part time degree when I'm in the sign on period and also help my parents out."

d35fil6,FaithFulStars,"Yeap! I'm only intending to serve the nation for extra 3 years provided I go for the part time degree. However Im afraid with these 3 years and forgoing of a full time degree for a part time one, my future will be affected by more than I imagine, hence have to seek out what happens first!

d35fuhx,FaithFulStars,Thanks for the encouragement!! Im just afraid I call the hotline  and I accidentally screw up (eg tell them my true intention of signing on for the security net and money) but home team agencies are for after nsf life right? Thanks for the help!!
d359mh2,FaithFulStars,"Do you mind elaborating on what u mean by that? Actually I also thought of that, for example airforce spf or other units like army intelligence"
d3601n7,FaithFulStars,"Thanks for the help!! I'm do looking forward to those moments indeed, but do u mind explaining to me how the loan will work in the ntu format? I mean there isn't much diff but I don't understand the nus one, is it like they loan u 90% of tuition fees, e.g. 30k over 3 years and then charge u 5% int per annum for every year after u graduate?"
d35flkg,FaithFulStars,"Are u implying that a psychology/sociology/business part time unisim degree will be worth less than a mathematical sciences degree in ntu when I am finding a job of my liking? But it's just sad that I have lesser passion for like it and engineering stuff, rather study people and like society but I think it's harder to transit into a career?? Thanks for the advice!!"
d3616kd,FaithFulStars,"Thanks for the advice!! Definitely thinking ard stats/business analytics.. not sure which is better though, are data analysts well paid?"
d375ovp,Gohster99,"Mm in regards to your interest it's hard to give you an answer, doing something focused limits some options whereas doing generic business will allow you to decide where you wanna specialize in the future. But from experience your degree really doesn't limit your job role. And yes you're right, the opportunity costs is too high compared to the perceived notion of a private uni grad disadvantages. I have many private uni grads in my firm (me included as mentioned) it's not a factor that stops people from hiring you, especially if you have straight A's or good grades - it shows your calibre. When it comes to hiring - my take is that people look at your attitude, aptitude, willingness to learn & ability to work well with others. The character value of supporting your parents while studying is far more valuable than a degree brand imo."
d359xp3,Klubeht,UOL Business. Don't know enough about the new degrees like Pol Sci or the social work degrees. The one that has the least discrepancy is probably the accounting degree where the big 4 firms generally have most new associates start at similar levels regardless of which uni I believe.
d35iezb,Wheat-gen-stein,I don't think LSA is restricted to officers only. During my time wospecs were also sponsored to get a degree.
d35igq0,Wheat-gen-stein,LSA is not a scholarship. Don't need good results at all. All you need is to sign-on plus have a spot in local Uni and you'll get sponsored by SAF.
d35ilud,Wheat-gen-stein,"NTU mathematical science has 3 specialisations. Pure, Applied, Statistics. There's also the Business Analytics track within mathematical science that you can be on after year 1. What type of track or specialisation determines what you study. You can also take a minor in finance or biz if you want to further boost your chances of getting into the banking industry."
d35p28f,ecargnahc,"Take the business/finance stream. Much higher chances of you getting a decent paying job not just only in the banking industry since the job scope is amazing, plus the math you do will not be hardcore at all (speaking from experience). Its mostly financial math and time series stuff. You'll only need to grind math if you take pure math. If you're interested, anything statistics related will also land you a very decent job (it gets even better if you're into data science). You can also take extra psych mods while doing your degree if you're interested I guess. "
d35p9qb,,Ever considered military police?
d35c8fr,,[deleted]
d359tvz,saperis,"Army doesn't give any usable real-life skills (unless you are scholar). SPF gives more options, and are more aligned to ur interests of business/finance/psychology/sociology."
d367f2n,parttime_economist,"Pretty much the same for all Unis. Look at it as taking the loan to invest in yourself.
Probably more important is how you plan to control your spending while in Uni. And self-discipline. When your classmates socialise at Starbucks or just over canteen food, tell yourself there's no shame in drinking plain water and packing your own lunch. Or working a humble job during summer break for extra money. Good luck."
d35go9n,myepicdemise,"That part-time unisim degree will worth less than a full time NTU degree because firstly, you're doing a part-time degree without working experience that would be relevant to your next job. Part-time degrees are usually for people who are already working and where getting that degree means moving up the career ladder, otherwise part-time degrees are generally perceived to be inherently worthless. You're gonna lose to graduates with full-time degree from a local university, because you're starting on a blank piece of paper (your sign-on experience is likely irrelevant to civilian jobs) yet you only have a part-time degree. Secondly, unisim is a newly established university, so employers' perception of it is definitely not gonna be as positive as NTU. As for whether a technical degree would be worth less than an arts degree for the same job, it really depends on what job it is. If you're gonna do social work, obviously any degree is fine. But working in a bank, they may prefer someone with a quantitative background."
d365pxt,doc-tom,"> are data analysts well paid?

It depends on how well you do your job. No major guarantees you a good starting pay. "
d35a8e0,FaithFulStars,"Sorry for so many qns, but what are the challenges you faced after graduating? (As compared to maybe nan yang business sch or smu business) and also how much are the sch fees + misc about thru out your years and is it a part time degree?"
d35zt5n,FaithFulStars,"But I will be officer, then go study 3 and bonded 4 years right? I'll be 27 when I come out. I'm just afraid I fuck up and don't want to integrate back.. maybe it's a good option since officer life is better than wospec maybe. But can i take on me4 route with mathematical sciences degree? thanks!!"
d35zqoe,FaithFulStars,I see!! What's the diff between applied and stats? Since I'm not into pure thanks!!
d3711pf,streamofmight,"You need to open up your mind and see the synergies between a mathematical degree and what there is in the real world.

For example, take statistics, do well in it, take up coding from codeacademy and you essentially will be armed with the right skills for the data analytics/management boom coming in 3-5 years. 

Don't limit your mind to thinking that whether you study has to relate to what you work in the future. I have engineering friends doing marketing roles, bio engineering friends doing supply chain roles, so on and so forth. University trains critical thinking. It may correlate with what you do in the future, but it is definitely not a causality. 

You have clearly made many bad life choices to end up with a sub-optimal A level results that have landed you in this current circumstance. I would strongly advise you to take the NTU math degree, work hard at it, get first class and do extra curricular learning/clubs to increase your own value. 

What I'm hearing from you is that your fear isn't that you can't pay off your tuition loan debts when you graduate. Deep down, it might be the insecurity of you doing well in your degree which results in you not getting a decent paying job of >$3k. That is where you need to stop. Make an active change in your life and mindset to stop procrastinating, put first things first and go out and get that first class honors. It is definitely possible for you, it just depends on how much effort you put in. Don't compromise on yourself, else you would just crash and burn and wonder why you took the NTU math degree, rake up a load of debt and not have signed on many years ago. 

A last thing you need to know is that coming out from the Army into the workforce is difficult. From my knowledge with hiring managers, they tend to prefer not to hire people from the Army. This is because Army is very bureaucratic (more so than the govt), and the stereotype is that people from the Army cannot ""chiong"". They are perceived as ""nua"" and are, hence, not seemed as the best choice. Esp if you are a Wospec, which is seen as inferior to officers. So take that in mind and choose wisely.

You are the master of your life. Don't make the mistakes that you made before that landed you in this situation, thinking of the What Ifs. Take control and make sure that life from here on has as little mistakes as possible.  "
d35zq9e,FaithFulStars,Thanks for the advice!! I guess I will take psych mods and definitely not pure math! But I do hope to be banking or financial sector if i go this route of math. How to increase my chances? Actually if i do well for year 1 can i get a scholarship or bond of some sort?
d35ztzk,FaithFulStars,What's the diff? I think that being a mp will be more lax and I will have time to take a part time degree tho. But I'm not sure for sign on ones..
d35ffya,FaithFulStars,"That's a kinda bad part for me since I heard if u sign on ns before u ord u will get backpay and regular pay, thats a huge boost for my financial needs haha.. I think I might give this a pass since I'm only looking for 3 years of my life, but thank you for sharing the information, now I know that I need to wait for ns to end first, haha!! Thanks alot bro!!"
d35ae7v,FaithFulStars,"Searched for spf, is there a short term contract as far as you know? But then again I am not sure if I will be allowed to take a part time degree. Do u know more? Thanks for your help!!"
d35aru7,triface1,"IMO, if we wanted to talk about options, I'd say SPF isn't that good. Can't comment on the interests alignment though.

Other agencies may be more versatile.

Edit: Assuming you mean sign on SPF as a JO. That 30k bonus is insane. SCDF is only giving 10k. :S"
d36woe0,kyith,not really. if you get to signals unit and are in engineering it is very complementary. there are units that does command and control systems taking care of client server network administration and there are even computer forensics
d368gu8,FaithFulStars,Thanks a lot!!! Anything I can do in my army years other than save to earn money and save more??
d35zxuk,FaithFulStars,"I see what u mean!! In other words, part time degrees cannot be called as a 'degree' unlike those from ntu and nus.. I'm still undecided on what I want to do but as for I'll lean towards banking/finance/business. So if i don't sign on I assume the 9 months from after i ord to the uni life is important, do u have any advice on what I should do during the 9 months? Max out money potential or?"
d366f4g,FaithFulStars,"As in in general ah haha, what do they generally do?"
d35bdld,Klubeht,"No worries, glad to help a fellow person. I studied full time because I guess I'm luckier than you where I didn't have to support my family financially so you will have to consider this context to when evaluating whether my advice is relevant to you.

Anyway, main challenge was finding a job. People from the private unis are the most affected whenever you read a report about youth and fresh grad unemployment. They make up the bulk of the numbers. Think at least 80%-90% of local uni grads find jobs even before graduation and those that don't are usually by their own choice(ie. gap year etc). Private uni grads have a much smaller scope where for example unless you at least have a 2nd upper degree you can almost forget about joining the civil service unless you have some exceptional standout skill else where. Once you take out Sales and events positions you are pretty much left with the admin, ops, customer service positions as the main types of jobs for something generic like a business degree.

School fees for SIM-UOL aren't that much more expensive than local uni, roughly about 28k for a 3 year course. However there are alot more misc fees like the exam fees which have been increasing every year so its almost 2k per year for the exam. And if you wish to have summer school overseas it has to be paid for at your own expense so that ranges from 6k-10k+ depending on which country your summer school is. The summer school btw isn't even a full semester so really few people can afford it.

Finally, unless you are studying something IT related be prepared to have a significantly lower starting pay compared to the local uni grads. The disparity can easily be 1k or even double yours if you compare to the average mgmt trainee or associate in the finance industry. Private uni starting pay is around 2.4k-2.8k whilst local uni is at least 3k.

This turned out much longer than I expected but really its quite a lot of things to consider. Hope this helps and PM if you need more info."
d36h0zz,ecargnahc,"I'm not too sure about scholarships or bonds since I'm not on one but from a friend of mine, you can apply even when you're studying and the chances are not too bad if you're doing well in school. As for how to increase your chances of being in the financial sector.. I don't think there's a way to do that really. You just have to do the basics like finance related mods and go for internships related to those things. "
d39zkpl,Tehpeng12,"Hey, I'm serving as an MP now. If you've got any questions on the vocation, you can drop me a PM."
d35akk4,keyboardsoldier,You aren't allowed to sign on to other organisations besides SAF until after you ORD so you can rule SPF out.
d369bp0,parttime_economist,"Find ways to improve your public speaking skills. Like Toastmasters. It will be tough, it will be embarrassing, it will be painful; but mindful practice should eventually help you in class presentations, interviews etc. And it might help get the girls to notice you, so what's not to like?"
d36at9e,myepicdemise,"Honestly just do whatever you want during the 9 months, as long as you won't regret it when you look back in the future. If you want to explore your career options you can apply for internships or talk to people at career fairs. If you want to go backpacking that's fine as well."
d35capu,lolnoob1459,Shit. Just finished my final sem and no job yet. GG
d35f4kt,FaithFulStars,"Thanks bro, unlikely to do engineer and tech related stuff and I see the huge disparity now, guess the difference of 1k per month up to 5 years alr covers what ns will give me during these 3 years of part time degree.. seriously a tough decisions to make still, let's say I can work hard and get a second class degree for psychology, will I lose out by a large margin to other psychology students? That being said psychology students don't even have a high starting pay :( also curious thing is that since I know that I am of weaker status from the nus/ntu students, will my boss appreciate the hard work I put in and put me at the same level or will I always be 1 level lower? Thanks alot!! Your help is really appreciated since I'm just a clueless sheep going through ns at this point of life :)"
d35c7vl,RedScorchingHot,"You are totally correct. Local U means a lot, esp for established companies in SG. So it's NUS > NTU > anything else in SG because fuck logic and hard work, NUS/NTU gets you to the interviews and through the door faster than anyone else with a local degree can. Unless of course you are good at your previous jobs and can substantiate it, else the bias for NUS/NTU is always there."
d3dyn0c,FaithFulStars,do u mind sharing how signing on as an mp will be like? 
d35fgia,FaithFulStars,Thanks I just found out!! Sadly though..
d36co3i,FaithFulStars,Ok thanks!! Will check out toastmasters!
d36cihk,FaithFulStars,My main objective is to earn as much money as possible while gaining as much experience though. So I guess I should get a job and apply for internship for the latter half! Thanks for the advice!!
d35zlho,Klubeht,"Whether your boss appreciates your hard work or not really depends on your boss so I can't help you there...also I dunno too much about how the large the margin to the local uni psychology students will be but let me put it to you this way.

The SIM psychology student I know is working as a marketing executive in the media industry. The ntu psychology student I know works in IE Singapore. So make what you will of that."
d35f665,FaithFulStars,"Wa, it's like for life sadly, so I should probably think harder about this.. thanks alot!!"
d3ez767,Tehpeng12,"Well, firstly, if you're heading on the WOSPEC route, you'll be sent to MP training school in MP Command first. You'll learn things such as military law, firearms training and self defense techniques.There won't be any field camps but you'd still have a few route marches since you're a regular. Training school period lasts for around 2 months and you'd be expected to stay in during the weekdays. 

Once you pass out, you'd either stay within the command to work in one of the units or posted out to work with security troopers. Chances are it will be the former. 

So what are the four units? They are the Military Police Training School, Enforcement Unit, Detention Barracks and Special Investigative Unit. 

There're quite a number if regulars studying part time. If I were you, I'd try my best to get posted to training school as an instructor as their work schedule is much more 'predictible' and thus easier to fit in your studying around.

That being said, studying while working requires alot of discipline. If you are leaving the force after getting your degree, make sure you get the best possible grades you can. It will be hard, but it's definitely doable.

I hope my comment has been helpful and if you have any other questions regarding the vocation, feel free to ask. All the best :D"
d36divl,parttime_economist,"You'd have to find a group that works for you, and some may cost more than others. If that doesn't work, learn to cook better - It helps stretch your dollar and you can get lifelong satisfaction. You'll save a bundle on VDay at least. Have fun."
d35zrtd,FaithFulStars,"I see!! But then again how sure can I be that I will be able to clear my loans? If u don't mind can u explain to me how the structure for repayment will work during my work life from I first graduate, how much will I owe etc"
d36e7os,FaithFulStars,Haha thanks!! Guess these are great saving tips I can try out during this period of time as compared to lazy around! What's sad is that I can't get my side income going.. so whatever is coming in is still lacking..
d36308q,Klubeht,"Sorry mate, can't help you there cause I never had to go through it. I imagine speaking to the respective school's student/care department or a bank on student loans will be much better placed to help you there.

cw07fmg,,"Your mother is depressed as heck. Depression is the worst. Part of your mind tells you to just get on with life, find other things worth living for and all that. But a BIG part of your mind and body just doesn't want to cooperate. Imagine being your own dead weight. This is why depressed people often think of death. It is seriously exhausting living like this. (source: am depressed).

Hoarding is a symptom of physiological problems. Depression is a leading cause and based on what you said, I think your father's affair and a bunch of other things have contributed to your mother's hoarding.  Some people over eat, some people drink......some people hoard. I think she might also have some anxiety issues.

However, there must be a willingness to change. Like if you were to tell me, do this and this...you will be able to snap out of this depressive rut and be normal again...I would do it in a heartbeat. I haven't totally given up yet. But not everyone is like this. Some depressed people just don't see the point anymore.

I read that people who hoard are not really aware of their behaviour. They don't really see a problem with it. I used to overeat like crazy. While I knew I was overeating, I was OK with it until I ate the large amount of food and then the regret will kick in. I think this is because there is a physical outcome to overeating aka FAT. Whereas hoarding is just 'stuff' in the house....I don't know if you can attach feelings of regret and inadequacy to hoarding. 

Have you seen the show 'Hoarders'. Look for it online. The hoarders go into a full meltdown when things get removed from their house. But the family members are told not to give in. It is very hard because you love your mother and don't want to see her upset but remember you have to do this for her well being and your brother. 

Your mother needs help. She needs to see a professional but she may not be receptive to this right now. She needs to know how her actions are affecting her children. You need to sit her down and tell her everything, even if she cries or gets defensive. Tell her you are not attacking her or judging her. 

You need to be strong. Perhaps you can begin to de-clutter while she is in the house (after having the talk with her). Start off with the unopened stock of things in the house. Do you really need her to get it for you? If you know where it is (look for it), just put it online and sell it away. And then start selling or giving away books. Start with your books first.

I'm terrified of roaches but that's ok. "
cw089pn,Hope83,"Hi OP,

There isn't a simple solution to hoarding. It requires the person to be willing to seek help but as with most hoarders, they typically don't and require intervention from others.

You will need to speak to a social worker at the nearest Family Service Centre to see how they can help you in this matter. Let the helping line professionals look into this. The other possibility is for you to see the MP although they may eventually direct you to the FSC as well. 

Don't think too far at this point. Focus on short term constructive steps that you are able to take. When the day comes where there needs to be a massive cleaning up to be done, there are many ways to seek help to get it done, you won't need to worry about cleaning it all up with ur sibling. 

As for the struggle on being filial and respectful, i have always told my own teenage mentees/students that taking a firm stance and speaking up on an impt issue with your parents doesn't mean you are not being filial.

Rudeness is more of how you say something, not so much of what you say.

cw0ep8c,freedaemons,"Please, please get professional help. I don't mean a cleaner or a psychologist for your mom. I mean a social worker who can help you sort your household out. 

I volunteer with habitat for humanity Singapore and we see a lot of hoarders on a regular basis and try to build relationships with them so they allow us to slowly change their habits and help them clean up their place, and I'm gonna say your case is pretty much the worst I've heard. I've seen mountains of clothes, mattresses crawling with bedbugs, but I've never seen an entire room surrendered to roaches.

What a social help group can do to help you is recognize that your house's case is severe, and gradually make the resources needed to help you change things available to you. Please don't try to shoulder this alone, it's a huge undertaking to turn this around, but it can definitely be done. Volunteers to help you sort out your house, help for your mom, they can make it happen, though it may take some time. 

I am curious how your mom manages to fund all that spending though.. if you're well off, sometimes you're straight up prioritized lower, we mostly help physically less able folks, the poor and the elderly. That's probably the case with most groups like ours."
cw0gbke,LikareVarius,"Man, fuck this shit, that is a terrible situation to be in, and it makes me mad that some people can do this to their kids. From your post it seems that you want to take up the mantle as the oldest child to shape up your living conditions.  
Here's what you can do:  
For your sanity  
* Get the key to your room and keep it locked when you are not around, to prevent more junk from piling up.  
* Start clearing up your room, get rid of things that are not yours either by selling them or stuffing them in the master bedroom. ( If you are not good at clearing stuff, set aside one hour every Saturday where you cannot do anything but clear stuff, you'll break the clutter down eventually)  
* Your mom will probably kick up a fuss about this, you have to stand your ground, and not give in.  
* After you have got yourself a livable room, you can carry on to the living room toilets, any common rooms. Whatever you can't get rid of, keep them in your mother's private rooms, e.g. master bedroom, study, etc.  
* If you can afford it, get some maid cleaning solution to help. e.g.   http://www.income.com.sg/value-added-services/referral-services/domestic-cleaning   
For your Mom's depression  
* Draw whatever blinds that neighbors cannot look in from, sunlight is very important to maintain one's mood.  
* Set up routines, preferably ones that involve social interactions, e.g. a routine part time job, fixed exercise class. You know your mom best, use whatever motivation you can think of to keep her going to these activities.   
For your mom's hoarding:   
* Every once in a while (not every time, this is important) bring up that her hoarding is hurting you or your brother, use extremely specific examples as much as possible, e.g. the insects from the junk piles are leading to rashes, skin issues. Especially when she brings up that they can be useful to you or your brother.    
* Get her items with the money you get from selling the junk, e.g small gold jewelery. Take her out to dinner or show affection occasionally when she helps to clear the junk. The ultimate goal here is for her to associate getting rid of junk with  good feelings or rewards.     
* Do not forcibly remove any junk from her private rooms, you need to leave those areas under her control.     

Some people were suggesting counseling or professional help for your mother's depression, its a feasible solution but its a long term one, expect 10-20 years or even forever to see results. As a last resort: http://app.msf.gov.sg/Policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Nurturing-Protecting-the-Young/Child-Protection-Welfare/Policy-on-Protection-Welfare-of-Children  I believe you can drop them an email asking for advise as well: http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/listing.asp?agency_subtype=dept&agency_id=0000022551

cw05soc,threesls,"Clean the second toilet. The decaying cockroaches will attract more cockroaches. 

Cockroaches are also attracted to decaying cellulose (Singapore ambient humidity is sufficient for them to be happy). I am not a hoarder but I do keep some books (yay academia); here is a solution: go to Giant when there is a sale, and buy lots and lots of plastic storage boxes when they are discounted to like $5 each. Put the books in the boxes. Stack the boxes, to the ceiling if you have to. 

(and if the contents of one of the boxes disappears to Salvation Army once a week or so, well, I won't tell your mum if you won't.)

You stay in a strata title, if your house is a cockroach nest, eventually one of your neighbours will notice. Then there'll be trouble.

Hoarding is hard to cure so I suggest attempting palliative solutions like these."

cw0aaz9,saiyanjesus,"I was in a similar situation as you with my father when I was your age. However, my father's problem was not as pronounced like your mother's.

He was a businessman and he insisted on keeping tons of Junk™ like mugs he printed for the business and insisted they were ""很值钱“. I'm was too young and cowardly to say ""No Dad, even if you gave it away, nobody will want it"". We had old memorabilia such as glass and cracked lanterns that he treasured but we never displayed in our house, old paintings of the initial business he started with my grandfather, old bicycles we never ride anymore.

Eventually when I moved out due to another unrelated argument, I started to stand up for myself more when I moved back in. I think the ""scare"" convinced my father that he could actually lose me.

The real change came when we started to move from a bigger HDB flat to a smaller HDB flat and I took the opportunity to get rid of everything. We had limited space, we bought a new smaller flat and I did not want to pay extra money for the movers to take multiple trips.

We got rid of the mugs save one carton (which we still don't use, he tried to give some cartons to our neighbours and they rejected it. Oh man, you should have seen my Dad's face. He was so sad :*( )

We got rid of old clothes, furniture, keepsakes. We got new cupboards for clothes and new appliances.

So I guess my advice is that you will need to give your mother a shock to make her wake up her idea."

cw07ga9,singaporekid123,"I feel for you. so much. My situation wasn't as bad as yours but my parents definitely have a mild case of hoarding. The same excuses, same situation, etc. I don't really have a solution for you, you are still young, so you probably have a while to go before you are financially independent to move out.

My advice, make 3 goals. Short (within 1 year), middle (3-5 years) and long term (>5years) goals. For example, short term goal can be to clean up the toilet and install a lock. Middle term, to study hard, get into uni and hall. Long term, work hard, earn loads, buy a flat, move your mum out and start from zero to help her with her hoarding. Having clear tangible goals help keep me sane, knowing things will get better. Hope it helps you too.

cw16fll,lumo-snox,"Since you guys are getting $6k in alimony I would assume that money isn't really of object. That being said,  I would immediately sign her up for therapy. Depression or not,  there are some pretty severe issues that has been internalized within these past few years. Man,  I thought I had some pretty tough childhood but yours seriously takes the cake. 


Emotional trauma,  as experienced in many ways,  may manifest in the form or physical and verbal abuse(my step-mom, financially related,  still love her to bits).  Please understand that treating the cause might be your only way out of this hoarder mentality.  Also,  assuming your mom is compliant,  engaging social services might be your next best bet. 


I'm pretty sure your mom loves you a lot,  just probably she's facing lots of issues herself which is driving you mad.  But please love yourself  too and don't feel guilty about staying in hall or whatnot.  You deserve to experience life as per normal.

cw1c8wq,ifailedmaths,"This sounds exactly like my girlfriend's situation, except that she lives in a 3 room HDB flat.

What my girlfriend's brother did was simply to throw things away, with or without their mother's consent. It might strain the relationship for a period of time but no family holds grudges for long. 

I suggest to slowly throw things out. Take out the small stuff first. If you can pack things neatly, do it. If not, throw them out. Justify yourself by saying that they are not needed and space is limited in the house.

cw0cjwh,nova9001,"I am having a great time reading this at work. Thank you for this article.

You must be quite well to do considering how your mum can afford to spend like that and doesn't seem to be working.

I would advise you to move out, its a good practice to living alone since you will be doing it in university. A room cost about 600 to 700 dollars? Think you can afford.

It will also help with your issues. Having resentment and anger penned up is really bad for health. Especially when its in your own house (normally ppl destress in their house not get more stress).

Would not advise changing your mum's personality. Probably requires expert help since this is not a hoarding syndrome but points to more deeper mental issues.

Basically before you can help others, help yourself. Move out, sort yourself out then help your mum."

Im getting really curious what the places looks like, you have rooms you have not been in for several years, that is just amazing. Anyway, this is not an acceptable situation to grow up in and you have every right to be upset.

It seems like your mom has kind of given up. She gets money without effort, the family is broken beyond repair(As she feels it) and the house is in such a mess that she probably feels that its just beyond her or you or anyone to fix the situation. Add to that this mentality of starting things that you do not finish, constantly disappointing yourself, and this is probably the result. 

She has you and your brother though and you need to make her understand that you two cant have normal lives like this and she needs to see that. I dont think you can appeal to her sense of what is right and wrong in this case, you need to appeal to her as your provider and protector. It will be a hard truth for her but you got to speak up that this is no longer okay, you and your brother have needs and have a future that did not end when your dad left. 

You are not a kid anymore either, if all else fails and your mom is not able to make hard decisions then perhaps you need to start making them for her, for yours and for your brother sake. "
cw1nl4n,lamp_girl,"OMG! Op I read this and let me tell you I'm in the same boat. I'm 27F, lived with hoarder mother for years then moved out and am now living with her again. Also, Char Siew Cockroach made me laugh like siao so later I will share my own funny/sad experiences battling my hoarder parents.

This is how I tackled my mother's problem. It's by no means perfect and also it's still a work in progress, but if you're looking for small solutions that will diminish the big problem then maybe this will help:

**1) Cockroach Infestation Problem**

If you call pest-control and pest bomb the entire cockroach colony in your bathroom & apartment, they will just crawl out and hide elsewhere and that's not what you want. Your neighbors will all complain coz they now have new brown guests. 

The trick is to kill them slowly and gradually. Let me introduce you to a glorious poison called [Roach Chalk](http://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-cockroach-chalk.html)
They affect the roach's brain and causes them to go haywire - something that fills me with glee coz I hate roaches.
Buy these in bulk and put it on all doorways to demarcate rooms where cockroaches aren't supposed to enter/cross. You can get them from those variety household item shops in places like Marine Parade Central. Just show the aunties the picture and ask if they stock.

Word of warning, this is literally poison so wear gloves when u touch them. **NEVER TOUCH THESE & THEN TOUCH FOOD.**

2nd weapon: [Roach Baits](http://www.fairprice.com.sg/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?urlRequestType=Base&catalogId=10051&categoryId=13722&productId=25464&errorViewName=ProductDisplayErrorView&langId=-1&top_category=&parent_category_rn=13722&storeId=10001) that slowly kills the roach and then kills other roaches that eat them.

Buy these in bulk also. Throw these inside the bathroom; just randomly scatter them. Because roaches eat anything, eventually one of the roaches will eat this. And they will all start to die slowly.
Also, stick these all over the house. 2 for every doorway. 1 for every corner. Roaches like to crawl close to the floor along the wall, so that is where you should stick these.

I used to live in a roach-infested apartment that had roaches coming up from the drain daily. So you also need to cover the drain. Get a cup or a plate (something that roaches can't chew through) and turn it upside down. I'm sure your mom won't miss the plate.

Hopefully, after some months you will see that the population of roaches is getting smaller.

**2) Your mum's hoarding & the excuses she uses**

Your mum will always say something like, ""This (book, toy, shirt) is still good. Don't throw away. Still can use for your kids."" ""I just want to provide the best for you."" These are all bullshit.

You gotta break down that argument because at the end of the day these are all excuses for hoarding things that she does not really need. You can say things like, ""By the time I have kids, these things would be so old they would fall apart / are moldy / the information in them would be outdated. Let's get rid of them now so OTHER PEOPLE can use them."" (This is my go-to argument) 

Because in the hoarder brain, they excuse themselves from throwing their stuff away by saying that these are all good things and will be usable some day. And at some level that might be true, but the sheer amount they hoard shows that ultimately they don't use that stuff as much as they would like to (or at all). And ultimately, they are just finding excuses for their own uncontrollable behaviour. And love for your children / providing for your children is a very compelling excuse.

Your second argument comes from yourself. Since you are in IP I'm assuming A levels is coming real soon within 1 or 2 years. This is a good way to start a conversation with your mum and get her to start making changes. Explain to her that after A levels comes uni, and when you graduate and eventually get married or whatever, there is no way you or your husband can live in the house, or even bring him back home coz it's so unpresentable. Tell her you won't have time to clean up since you will be busy from now on. If the situation becomes so bad, the neighbors will call police to forcibly remove her from the apartment. This is not something that she wants, nor is it something that you want.

I won't cover the mental health resources to help your mum's hoarding because other people have commented on them.

But as a general rule, it is good if you can slowly introduce habits for your mum. e.g. taiji class at the nearby CC or smth. It gets her out of the house and gives you time to clear out the stuff. Also, most taiji aunties are kaypoh so maybe after a while she will feel pressure to clean up her house.

These changes will help give your mum some sense of accomplishment/like her life is getting better/she is healthier. I understand it's not easy to recover from divorce, esp when one party was cheating. But she has to start somewhere and feel like her life is in control. And how she can do that is to make decisions for her health like exercise, and then gradually clear things out to improve her environment.

**3) Throwing things secretly**

Start with the stuff she can't see. Like items buried under other items or things in your room. Throw 5 items a day. Set a target for your brother too. Get a lock for ur room.

Also, if you throw outside at the garbage area for your building or on your floor (if the rubbish chute is outside), she can see it and then bring it back in (I know this because my parents used to dumpster dive). So leave the stuff on another floor or throw the bulky stuff like the luggage in the next building (troublesome I know).

**3) Selling stuff on Carousell**

This is more time consuming and I honestly think you need a friend to help you. Because you need to sort through your stuff and pick what can be sold or not. Also, you need to constantly update your items so that it comes out on top so people view them and it can be annoying.

But as a general rule, if you can sell the usable items cheap enough, someone else will surely buy them. Use good lighting / edit the picture, take the picture outdoors with a white background.

If you want to bulk sell, you can call [Cash Converters](http://www.cashconvertersasia.com/sg/we-buy/) and ask them to come down to your place and pick up everything. They won't give a good price but at least they can take away some of the bulkiest items like the heaviest books etc.

I hope this is useful. Later I post my own story in another comment."

If it does not help call social services. You are still a minor and should not be living like this. 

**Alternatively, could you call your father and live with him instead? He should be more responsible for you.**"
cw1gj8i,Wheat-gen-stein,"Its good that you are at least financially well off if your mom gets an alimony of $6000. My house has three working adults and we don't even make that much lol. 

IMO, I think you're really great for wanting to help your mum. To be perfectly honest, if I were you, I'd make sure I get a cut of alimony or support for my university fees and ditch my mum to stay in hall when I get into uni. I wouldn't blame you either if you go down this route because I know I wouldn't have the mental strength to help my own mother if she is in that situation.

You can go see your MP if you need some direction as to which agencies to contact. Get her some professional mental help and physical help to clean up the house. You could hire some cleaners and movers, they should not be that expensive with that alimony. Hoarding is a vicious cycle that entrenches her mental instability. Depressed ->> hoards and makes house messy and dirty ->>Gets more depressed from the mess in the house. So you'll have to settle both her mental state and the physical state of the house at the same time to get things done properly.  Are there any relatives that you can turn to for help? Now is not the time to be embarrassed. What you want is all the help you can get. Face shouldn't even be an issue here. Are there any teachers in school that you can approach for help? 

I think a part of why your mum hoards is because she is allowed to. Cut off her $6000 and she would probably be less able to hoard. Would there be any way to get the $6000 to be controlled by someone else that is more responsible? Or have a big chunk of it go into savings for yours and your brothers future? My fear is that the spending goes out of control and you and your brother are left to fend for yourselves without financial support.

Lastly, don't throw away those books if you can help it. You can have a book sale or as a last resort you can just donate them to salvation army. Or sell them on carousel."
cw1ksf3,myr0n,my SO mum is a hoarder too but she been growing up like this since her dad left very early in her life. The only way to beat this is to burn the house...or move out. You can try to clean up things yourself but it will still come back.
cw1nfb4,xiangusk,"HI I am very sorry to hear about your living conditions. I too live with a hoarder until I moved out. My father is one. Then I married one without knowing he is one. The underlying condition of a hoarder is a mental problem. It is typically anxiety, and hoarder gives the hoarder an outlet for expressing the control they don't have over their lives. For my husband, I print out hoarding articles, I print out examples, i don't nag but actively encourage him when he throws things away. Even if it is only a box. You must know it is impossible to declutter secretly. It makes the anxious person feel more anxious and betrayed.

You will also need to accept that your home may be slightly decluttered it will not be your expectation of an empty home. 

There is something that I would suggest that you work on which could bring a sense of control for your mom which is the alimony. Most people who are hoarders may have problems with finances or they could be overally frugal because they fear the day that might come when their world is overturned. I would suggest that you start helping to manage the budget by tracking every household expenditure. If your mom buys something that is not neccessary, question her purchase. She might be upset but explain that you are helping to ensure she saves enough for retirement, rainy day, wasteful etc whatever that appeals to the hoarding side of her. This may an effective way to control her hoarding. This didn't work for my husband and my dad because they are way more frugal than me. :| Hope it helps you.


"
d1g0as2,throwaway_hoard,"Hi OP, I have a parent who hoards books as well. Dad still has books from when he was in uni and toys for us from 30 years ago. After I moved into hall in uni, I returned home to find that my bedroom has been overtaken by junk and since then (7 years ago) I've been sleeping in the living room sofa. Be prepared that once you're not living at home, you will be surrendering the space to junk and might never dig your room back. 

I was shocked to find out I had no room to stay when I came back. During the 4 years in uni, whenever I return home, I will see more junk piling up in my room. However, I believed my parents when they said that they will clear out the room when I return home. That didn't happen.

**Here is what I wished I did** - during uni, plan your finances carefully and take up part time jobs if possible, so you can save some cash to rent after uni ends. What saved my sanity was renting rooms on weekends to take a breather in. I found a friend with a spare place for about $40-80 a day, and rented saturday nights. Other den that, spend as much time outside as possible - Library and cafes with free wifi are good places, so is SMU because its an open area with power plugs, and a good environment. Get a friend to accompany you because hiding out from your house does get lonely and you feel like a fugitive, and get involved with activities outside. 

**The best solution for books** is to bring them to the library and give them away there - the library has an exchange section where anyone can dump books to be given away free for others to take. 

Whenever I do that, there will be a group of people who crowds around and takes books, and I sometime chat with them and recommend books to their interests. Its more fulfilling then dumping at Salvation army or carouselling them.

I tried Carousell and gumtree for selling books, but realized that maintaining the chats and accounts too tiring and time consuming. Please spend the time more constructively, posting books online and waiting for buyers is not worth the money you earn from it. 

**While throwing away the hoarder's stuff will make the hoarder anxious**, I have since learnt that there is so much junk that the hoarder doesn't even remember or know what they have. 

Sometimes when I throw away things, they will whine and say things like those are still useful and blame you for it even when it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes when I ask them if something is okay to throw, they look at me and say ""I don't remember I still have this"" - but now that they remember you can't throw it. I always kick myself during those situations, because I could have thrown it out without them knowing it. 

**I have approached FSC and various counsellors for help**, but they provided minimal help. In fact, FSC asked me to consider if its my fault for not talking to my parents about it properly, even though I told them I've told my parents about it many times. Each time I go I just break down in tears and they don't help or offer any feasible solutions, and I spend the rest of the day depressed. However, I only approached them when I was 28, so things might be different for you as you're still a minor. 

**The best advice I've gotten from a counsellor** was to move out. I had been reluctant to do so for many reasons - filial piety, taking care of my siblings who are still staying with my parents, etc. However, I moved out last year, and it has been such a great experience. 

I don't have to always be alert and afraid of being yelled at for things, I don't have to protect my things (I stayed in the storeroom for the previous 2 years and had to keep my personal set of utensils in my wardrobe because the kitchen was too dirty, coz parents slept in the 2 living room sofas) or be afraid of my things going missing, and I don't have to be stressed out by the mess at home when I return home everyday. Same situation - lights broken, pipe leaking, but parents too ashamed of hoard to get repairmen in. Siblings showering in the dark now. 

I try my best to fix things for them when I go back, but my help is not always appreciated.  

I sleep so much better. I swear. This is the best thing that will happen to you. Being able to sleep. It took me a year to feel comfortable in a bed - I constantly went outside to sleep in the sofa for the first 6 months after moving out, but now bed is good. 

**If you move out, however, there will be friends who blame you for protecting your sanity.** That happened to me, from friends I've had for 15 years, who say that your mom cares for you, your mom only wants the best for you, how can you do this to your family, etc. You'll feel supremely guilty. However, they don't understand, they aren't there when I had to carry my laundry 10 blocks away every week, so don't blame them and move on with your life. (by the way, please find a laundry service for your clothes. You can get a 1kg bag of clothes washed for $5, don't waste time hand washing them. You can also get the laundry service to collect and deliver to your doorstep, but I've discovered that laundry services are everywhere these days, in shopping malls and under hdb blocks.)

Singapore being what it is, people's view is that it is too expensive for rent and you don't have an adequate reason to rent. People will shame you for spending money needlessly. They will stress you about finances and question you as a person, on top of seeing you as unfilial and ungrateful. Don't tell anyone you're staying away from your family if possible. 

**WRT hyperventilating and panic attacks, it happens to me too.** I've been so stressed about my living situation my whole life that I've hyperventilated with friends who luckily took care of me. If I hyperventilated at home, I will be shouted at too. Once I was choking on something on my knees on the floor gasping for breath and both my siblings continued chilling at the sofa and shouted at me to stop scaring them. When my mom slammed the door onto my thumb because I didn't close the door fast enough and neighbours might look in and see the hoarding, she yelled at me for bursting into tears. So don't expect sympathy for your feelings at home, you're better off with your friends for emotional support. 

One last piece of advice: **DO NOT get attached with a boy just to have a place to stay.** I made that mistake repeatedly, and always end up with either abusive guys or guys with boundary problems who just want to take advantage of you. Don't rush a relationship because someone promises you a place - or because you're subconciously looking for a place to escape to. Don't let any guys know about your hoarding situation unless you're sure of their good character. That is the priority in maintaining good relationships, and you don't want more emotional baggage.

You're strong, you can do it. :)

I really wished there's a local support group tho, for children of hoarders. Wish you all the best in surviving, and one day you could be thriving instead of just being overwhelmed by the problem of hoarding.

Not sure if facing this shit everyday is what makes us sad and depressed people but I'm bipolar and I once had a panic attack at home. She hit me while I was hyperventilating and asked me to stop acting like that 'in the name of Jesus


Hey OP, dont be too hard on yourself as well and certainly don't self-diagnose yourself as bipolar. We all have our ups and downs in life, it doesn't mean we have bipolar disorder. I think it's great that you recognize the problem and are seeking help! All I can say is, change all the things that are within your control to the best of your abilities (such as cleaning your room, giving yourself a conducive environment, helping your brother cope etc), and leave the rest to fate."
cw0mdf1,sgthrowaway_1,Hahahaha some of the books have been conveniently packed into those plastic boxes already.

I once let slip that I told him about which uni course I'm planning to apply to and she was so angry she gave me the silent treatment for days...... so if I appeal to my dad for help it'll make her feel super betrayed and will kill her..
cw3n4bo,notfated,"Just to add on to the comment. I agree that books is a good start. Maybe you can try suggesting donating the books to orphanages or some charity organisation.

You may have to change the way you interact with your mom and start to put yourself and your brothers well-being in front of her perceived happiness(Though this ""happiness"" is destructive for the whole family, herself included). It seems to me that you put your mothers happiness in front of everything in the family even though her behaviour is extremely selfish and is destroying the family. No need to be mean but you can diffinitively be firm and start to ask for concrete steps and results. **Your and your brothers well being and quality of life has value that she needs to respect too!**

Sucks to be you and have this put on your shoulders at your age but it is what it is. I dont think this kind of situation will resolve itself so its kind of up to you."
cx8wtv9,dungalot,"Having once been stuck in a similar situation, although my mom's hoarding never got as bad- but similar dynamics with a distant Father that had an affair / emotionally manipulative and self-destructive mom- I would like to say that you should not be responsible for your mom's resentment towards your father, and should never feel like you have to give one parent up to keep another.

They should both love you, and want what is best for you- regardless of their feelings for each other. The moment one of them uses your affection for them, to hurt the other parent- that is immensely unhealthy behaviour, and it would end up destroying any positive relationship you could have with either of them.

I was fed quite a lot of stories about how evil and terrible my dad was, and as he was away from home most of the time he could not defend himself. But at the same time, my mother's reliance on me was suffocating, although I felt comforted that she trusted me.

It wasn't until my mom passed away, that I was able to regain a sense of balance, to patch things up with my dad, and to see the situation from a more neutral perspective. They both had their faults, but my mom should never have made me feel like being my dad's daughter was an unforgivable betrayal. Her problem with him, should have been settled with him- and not me.

With the distance, I could begin to understand why he stayed away. Not why he strayed, but why he found it so hard to be with her. I didn't fault him for leaving- I used to wish everyday that I could escape from the house, and from the worst parts of my mom. When things were good, it was really good. But more often than not it was bad.

At the end of the day my mom wasn't a healthy person, and she did a lot of things that wasn't right for me or for her. As much as I love her, I felt like I was being sucked into a very dark and narrow world- and that wasn't making me happy or healthy either.

...I'm glad that my dad didn't resent me for taking my mom's side, when I felt that she needed me. But at the same time, I feel sad for leaving him alone, when really it should never have been a him or her scenario.

So OP...what I'm saying is: give your dad a chance to be a dad to you, and learn how to love your mom, but not to allow her to use you as a weapon to hurt your dad. When she does that, it hurts not just him- but you as well. Be there for her, be supportive and loving, but don't sacrifice your relationships just to make her happy- as her happiness/unhappiness is beyond your control."

cjqp66j,,"Hey, I'm sorry you feel this way. Please PM me and we can chat. Depression is a real bitch but you're not alone.

I can identify somewhat with what you're going through,  mostly thru similar personal experience.

Chances will come for you to experience the things you want to experience at a later date.  You're still young, in your early 20s. The best part of your life is still yet to come, believe me. I got to have so many wonderful experiences in grad school. 

You will always be able to have life changing experiences at any time in your life. Stuff that you can only do at uni/with uni friends usually comprises drinking, sex, and drugs. It gets old after a while. I'm *not* saying that those are the ""social opportunities"" you mentioned,  this is just for arguments  sake. 

 Please feel free to PM me. Take care ☺ at least know that you're not alone. 
"
cjqr90f,Hope83,"Don't buy into the hype of the party and fun culture and all that the best years of your life are when you are in school/uni. Granted working life ain't a bed of roses but it is precisely the crazy idea that we must all have a terrific social and eventful life in uni will only make us feel lousy about yourself. If you ask me, I would say the jc/poly to uni period is potentially the most pretentious time of our lives, where most people may or may not be having fun but very few are true to themselves. Some people call it growing up pains, I call it a massive disconnect from being congruent.

Depression can be a hallowing experience and even after you recovered, you wonder whether you could ever be the same again, whether you can be back to being the person you used to be and whether the depression journey has taken away so much from you that you are basically handicapped or crippled for the rest of your life. 

You mentioned you feel like crying when you see the freshies. I think you might be grieving.  That said,  don't compare yourself to anyone else. Many of them may be facing inner struggles, trying so hard to fit. 

Take it from someone who has gone through similar crap in life before. Your life ain't over. There is hope no matter how much it may look like there ain't any now. You are not alone. "
cjqrowz,tiaph,"Hey, I am currently schooling in NUS. I am not exactly blaming the culture but more often than not it does makes university a lonely place.

If you want someone who is easy to talk to or just someone to have a meal with, I am offering myself! just let me know and we can work something out. It will be fun, or at the very least a breathe of fresh air."
cjqrvbv,oratorioo,"I'm going to be a 4th year student and I've noticed that most of the students tend to have a cold demeanor or at least look like it.

Lastly, the best time of your life don't have to be at your 20s. It could be anytime but it's all up to you to decide when you want to make it happen."
cjqot9i,tehokosong,"You can talk to the student counselling center staff for help.

As for your feeling of loneliness, i don't think you are the only 1 feeling that way. If it's possible, look for friends outside of school, with activities that you like. Eg: Running groups, Cycling groups, Drinking forum (this was me).

This sense of helplessness that you feel will get better if you are willing to take the first step towards seeking help and changing your mindset of what might make you happy."
cjqp6kf,eStonez,"You know what ? You have one problem ""best years of your life problem"", same as youngsters around your age. Some of them looks so happy outside and not so much inside. Just let me change one thing for you. ""Best year of my life .. is this year."" 

Having a real friend is always good but being lonely is better than having many fake/shallow/superficial friends. If you are lonely, do volunteer works, you will not be alone anymore."
cjqodhc,hannorx,"To clarify - are you depressed because you feel isolated in university, or is your depression already existed before but been made worse because of university?"
cjqpesp,sitsthewind,"Congrats on recovery! :)

Regarding loneliness: have you considered joining a club or interest group? It's the start of a new academic year - it's a good chance to make friends! If you're in NUS, I think NUS is currently having some sort of fair on today in the sports hall. Or just go for their welcome teas - there should be a few, since it's the beginning of the academic year. 

Talk to someone you sit next to in lecture/class. This doesn't always work - you may not click, but talking to people is a lot like that. It's a hit-and-miss thing - you won't click with everyone, but the point is to keep trying until you do. Don't be put off by big groups.

Depending on your course/major/school culture, speaking up in class sometimes works - partly because people think you're smart/interesting, and approach you for notes/more in-depth class discussion.

Something else about being self-conscious that has helped me: fake it until you make it. It doesn't matter what you're thinking inside: people are only going to be seeing the outside (for first impressions anyway). And besides: if you do anything embarrassing, you're only going to be in NUS for one more year. They aren't going to remember it/be around to judge you. 

Good luck! I find being social a lot of work, and depression usually makes it a lot harder. So jiayou! :)"

cjqr5eb,dadablacksheep,"Reminds me of this short film (from a sg uni as well)
http://vimeo.com/93073655

It's good that you recognise your depression and you try to seek help but it would be better to actively seek help from actual counsellors rather than redditors on the net. "
cjqto96,ceddya,"While uni may be a good time to make friends, it's also not the only opportunity you have.

Anyway, your social issues and poor grades seem to stem from your anxiety (social anxiety disorder, perhaps?) and depression. These two things have exceeding high co-morbidity, and I speak from experience that you're not going to be able to overcome these things alone.

This is why I'm honestly recommending that you seek counsel from a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Medications can help with your anxiety and depression, and psychotherapy is particularly helpful (if nothing else, it's very cathartic to speak to someone who gets what you're going through). IMH provides excellent treatment, but if you would like more discretion, you can always consider the private route if you can afford it.

Anyway, the bottom line is that you should really seek some form of counseling. Don't get stuck in your current status quo. With proper help, your social life and grades can rebuilt, so there's always hope!

cjqw8a8,aktsukikeeper,"University is a pretty isolating place, depression or not, disease or not. 

"
cjqxqlm,,"Hey guy/girl,

I was actually rather depressed as well in the 2 years leading up to university (i notice it now). Life just generally felt so boring and pointless; my daily routine was just go school, back home, procrastinate and barely study.

Life is better now since I've gotten into uni but you should know that now you're healthier/in better shape, you need to put the effort in to getting yourself out there. 

Join some clubs that interest you, do volunteer work, join a sport club (with like weekly games) or just go run/gym. You need to give your mind some times to just focus on one thing and forget about your 'problems'. 

I felt like being a 'yes' man for awhile really helped me; this meaning that whenever an opportunity for me to participate in something arose, I would grab it - even if i didn't feel like it or i was a bit busy.

I hope you make yourself take the first steps towards making your life better. It will happen eventually, but if you act on it now, it will come sooner :)"

cjrtrmy,captmomo,"sup`, I was in the same boat as you.. and the best advice I can give is to suck it up and push yourself out of your comfort zone. I suffered from an ED and depression and was really self conscious just like you, so I tried my best to avoid social interactions. However after interacting with others on self-help forums, I realised the best thing to do was just to get out there and meet people!  
My best friends in uni were two randoms I just started talking to during my first lecture in uni! I started pushing myself to try new things eg. volunteering, attending temple services, church services, new sports, sports events. 
seriously, the only way to break the cycle is to step out of it. all the best op!

cjs1fh5,caiyixian,"You're probably in your final year now so why not join a CCA or something? I could make friends in my faculty (School of Computer Engineering) because people there was really not of my wavelength and all, so I know how it feels to be like a ghost walking down the school hallways, but thank heavens for my Hall/Hostel. 5th year staying here, retained due to pure laziness/epilepsy, and friends there are the the only thing keeping me sane.

I'm sure your university has a counselling centre, so do check it out, and I wish you all the best."
cjsdw5u,a5ph,"I have to disagree. I really don't think that university is the ""best years"" of the life. If you look at it like some sort popularity contest, then uni's prolly the place to be, where some people are desperate for attention and the laizzes faire lifestyle seems to be the norm. The best years are yet to come. When you get that job you really want, or discover your mettle to start your own business. Or start a family. Or find spirituality. 

In my book, these things are valued way more than university life. Maybe you see college as the peak because you have not experienced what's beyond that. So don't fret, there's more to life than 4 years in an oversized school. Trust me. 

Not sure if I helped, but good luck. Make friends, have fun, study hard, be kind. And get professional help when you need it. "

cjr0iq1,oOeyes,"Thanks. I'm trying hard to hang on. I know the depressed me isnt the real me but I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to being as carefree or optimistic as I was before my depression and before entering uni. One reason is because I fell sick and that made me realize how fragile everything is. Because of that I always feel scared, like life is just so uncertain. One day u have everything and the next day u have nothing. 

I just hope that I will get more confident again. I lost almost all my confidence in uni. Funny thing is the uni I go to is supposed to make me more outspoken and confident. Instead I ended up developing anxiety, like I'm being put under constant stress. I guess the uni I chose really believes in trial by fire...but I find that I thrive better under encouragement and shrivel up when Im criticized.

 I know that I'll always have experiences. But sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on the ""uni experience"" you know? I know it sounds super silly n stuff.

But after I went to university, I found it difficult to make friends and felt really self conscious. Then I developed an autoimmune disease which exacerbated my condition. That's when I started feeling really isolated and depressed. I also started developing anxiety issues, and felt really really self conscious. That experience made me realize that depression can be like a light switch in your brain that suddenly switches off.....

Now, my disease has stabilized. According to my medical doctor I should no longer be feeling depressed (guess my ""brain chemistry"" should be fixed already)....but I still feel very down and anxious. I just feel so lonely man :'( haai"

Now I just need the courage to actually attend them and follow through. I always sign up for stuff but never really show up, and before showing up I usually feel really anxious. Ever since coming to university my self esteem has really taken a blow :< I know the only way to get over it is to actually show up....

Faking it till you make it really hurts. I know it works, but to a certain extent because I've been faking it for the past few years. But when I walk home from school all alone, any sense of temporary confidence I have tends to disappear...not sure how to explain it. I go back to my normal, depressed, ""think too much"" self. I think I'm someone who shouldn't spend too much time alone...the longer I'm alone the more self-sabotaging thoughts and fearful exaggerations I have

I did say hi once but the girl was so super snooty it totally backfired and when we had to do a group project she totally ignored me. Guess my lack of social proof and looking like an outcast was really turn-offish. I know that was only 1 bad experience...I just couldn't believe it cuz that girl was acting like a sec sch ah lian in university!

So work a few years and return for a pos-grad when you're feeling better and can afford it! All is not lost :)

One of my friends had an engineering degree in NTU and worked for a few years before he decided he wanted to practice law. He went to NUS (graduates get to skip one year), and joined a hall, and aside from all the various extra curricular hall activities he took part in, he ran for and was block leader for a year, which takes a whole lot of one's time.

Not saying you need to do all that (I wouldn't), but I'm saying it's one possible path, and ultimately, you can make friends and take part in some experiences you believe were denied to you because of your illness. Baby steps, and all the best to you in rebuilding your health and yourself!"
cjsqk0b,av1cus,"When I was depressed, I felt the same way as you are feeling right now, i.e. that I'd never go back to being the me pre-depression, the me that was X, Y,Z (insert desired adjectives here).  

Trust me, it's just a feeling. It's a *lie*. Your brain has a habit of lying to you when you're depressed.

What you have to do now is to fight the negative thoughts. The most practical ways that I have personally used (in no particular order) are:

* 1) *Exercise regularly*

Like, every day. Even when you don't feel like it. Even when you feel like shit. Just go out there and run, do a gym workout, or whatever makes you sweat (although personally I find aerobic exercise more efficacious than anaerobic exercise). The endorphin boost will help you tremendously. You'll notice that you'll start feeling a little more positive, and maybe that life just isn't so shitty as you thought it was an hour ago.

* 2)* Seek counseling* 

Your uni mental health center is a good place to start. For one, it's free. Secondly, staff working there are specially trained to deal with mental health problems specific to the college student/young adult population. So you'll get counselors more sympathetic *and* more knowledgeable about your plight than some random GP/psychiatrist. Of course, if you have a doctor you can trust (e.g. the one you saw for your sickness) by all means open up to them, they'll be more than willing to help you.

* 3) *Get a pet*

I know, right? Get a pet, he says. Trust me, it does help with your depression. Looking after an animal that is more helpless than yourself will help relieve the cycle of negative thoughts in your mind by providing a cute and furry (I'm thinking hamster here haha) distraction. Obviously if you live in the dorms then no point in smuggling one on campus, but do try to get access to other people's pets if possible. Even if you're not an animal person, the principle works.


Try it out. Hope the above advice helps you as much as it has helped me.


> I guess the uni I chose really believes in trial by fire...

BTW, Could you elaborate on that? The ""trial by fire"" sounds like an artifact of your course rather than the uni, IMHO.

Take care,

> I always sign up for stuff but never really show up, and before showing up I usually feel really anxious. 

Depending on the size of the club and the people turning up and the varing friendliness of the people, the club members may initiate conversation with you. Making friends might work, it might not, it might need more time to do so - but life is partly about taking these kinds of risks. Anyway, if it goes wrong (you don't get to talk to anyone, you aren't interested in the clubs), you don't know anyone there, so you can just walk out (politely) and try again at the next club.

> But when I walk home from school all alone, any sense of temporary confidence I have tends to disappear

I think I get what you're saying. I let myself do that because it feels like de-stressing. But I've also tried to recognise that this isn't productive, so after some time of doing this (which I monitor strictly - e.g., I'll give myself the whole bus ride to indulge in these thoughts), I force myself to do other things, like messing around on the internet (e.g. on reddit). It distracts me and I tell myself it's a far more productive and less destructive option. "

cj89kk4,ceddya,"Hi

I've been battling depression on/off for the past 6 years. Anyway, you have two options - you can see a psychiatrist at one of the private hospitals (or those with their own independent clinics), but those will set you back at least $180 per session. They'll help formulate a diagnosis and prescribe anti-depressants.

Additionally, I've found that seeing a psychologist for CBT or EFT is a really good complement to the meds since they help you learn coping techniques. If you see one privately, expect to pay roughly the same amount of at least $150 per hour.

However, if you find these charges too expensive like I did, you may wish to consider IMH. In particular, the Sayang Wellness Clinic is kind of the 'privatized' wing of IMH. Charges are much lower, and as a current patient, I can attest to the fact the care provided there is excellent (especially the nurses, they are extremely friendly). I found it to be the best balance between being affordable while still allowing me a higher degree of privacy.

Sorry if I come off as an advert, but here are some links for your further perusal:

[IMH Appointments](https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=237)

[Sayang Wellness Clinic](https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=284)

[IMH Charges*]
(https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=244)

*All patients of Sayang fall under the non-subsidized rate

Good luck, I hope you find the help you're looking for!"
cj84dfr,elaborateruser,"I really think Singapore needs to ramp up its efforts in making mental health a priority in terms of public education and ease of access to treatment for patients. This is so important since these are people who are actually afflicted with symptoms that might prevent them from taking the initiative to seek treatment.

Me: very possibly depressed and have been for the past 3 years, don't know how (and maybe afraid) to start looking for help, and have given up. Suck thumb, I guess. Life isn't supposed to be fair."
cj84se5,,"Yes you need to see a psychiatrist to get a prescription to these medication.

How about you visit a counsellor first to see if cognitive behavioral therapy works for you? They are cheaper, I heard.

According to my friends who've gone under anti-depressants before, the medication could cause adverse side effects and the process of weaning off it could get quite bad... so do put that under consideration."
cj87d6k,teamaniac,"Go to a polyclinic and get a referral to a psychiatrist. If you are a Singapore citizen, you will be entitled to the subsided rate through this method. 

As for the cost, it depends on what anti-depressants you're placed. Medications like sodium valproate, Prozac or 1st generation of anti-depressant are usually much cheaper than the 2nd or 3rd generation. Like venlafaxine, Zoloft are more expensive because the patent has not expire and you can't get generic ones yet. Remember to let your doctor know that you have financial difficulty. 

You can also apply to use your cpf to pay for your medications, blood tests and consultation if you have been diagnosed with depression. So say your bill is $100, you will have to pay the first $30 or so, and 10% of the balance. Which means you got to pay $37. The balance may be deducted by your cpf. There is a cap on how much you can use and iirc, it's $400 per year. 

EDIT: to use your cpf, you've to fill in a form and also your psychiatrist got to sign, saying that you have depression. And each visit, you got to let the person at the counter know you will be using cpf to pay during registration and not wait till payment. "
cj87yn8,quietowlet,"What teamaniac said, go to a polyclinic and ask for a referral.

In the meantime, see if your school offers any counseling services. It's not a substitute for proper psychiatric help, but it may help while you're waiting for an appointment.

e: Here's an older thread about seeking psychiatric help in Singapore - http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/215yvd/psychiatric_help/ "
cj8atoz,MrDLTE3,"Hello,

You can try visiting IMH if you're tight financially. There's a stigma surrounding IMH that if its cheap its not good but trust me, the doctors there are well trained too.

Good luck"

cj89m2i,llosa,"As someone who has had both medication and talk therapy for depression, Prozac or any other antidepressant isn't the 'magical quick fix' you're looking for. Few psychiatrists will prescribe you anything without signing you up for counseling/an exercise plan etc. Trust me, you have time right now for the process. Medication alone isn't going to 'breeze you through' a bumpy spot. It is very dangerous to go on SSRIs without complementary therapy."
cj8a0cd,sitsthewind,"Adding on to /u/llosa, medication takes time to work. Among other considerations:

* There can/will be side effects, both to getting on the medication and getting off the medication. Nausea, appetite changes - the side effects vary depending on the medication. 
* There is no one type of anti-depressant, and not all of them will work for you. So you can spend two months trying one, determining that it doesn't work, then a month getting off the anti-depressant, trying a new one, etc. Time frames vary, but if you are unlucky, a counsellor will be much faster.
* Cost. 
* Being on anti-depressants also have side effects. 

I recommend going to a counsellor first and then asking them if they have a referral to a psychiatrist. I've heard good things about the [Counselling and Care Centre](http://www.counsel.org.sg/) for starters. Counselling/talk therapy could potentially take less time than medication.

Lastly: depending on your school, there may be mental health services available. Check if there are. Good luck!"
cj8al9f,,"You could talk to your regular GP about it. Maybe he'll give you something less strong to see if it's enough to curb your emotions so that you can function somewhat?

Many anti-depressants make people numb... and that's not a good thing."
cj88woc,teamaniac,"Expats with EP aren't entitled to subsidies as compared to citizens or PR. Your best bet is to research and ask around which is the best psychiatrist around before going. 

Since you will be treated as a private patient, don't bother going through the polyclinic method. Just walk in to hospitals or call for private clinics to make an appointment. 

As mentioned, tell the doctor you would like to try the cheaper first generation meds first before going on to the newer meds which can be expensive. 

EDIT: just a gentle reminder that psychiatrist in general don't talk much here. They only prescribe medications. If you need therapy, you would also need to talk to a psychologist. "
cj8xwj1,wildcard1992,"Yeah but with depression, pills are really a hit and miss thing. You'd have to try certain drugs or even combinations of drugs to get rid of your depression. They are likely to turn you into a drooling, emotionless zombie as they are to removing symptoms of depression.

e7jntdh,steamkuaypng,You can actually rent. It’s up to you honestly. 
e7jowjy,Ashernt,"Cost is the issue here. Majority don't move out because of that. 

Rental usually is around 500 to 700 for a room. That may or may not include utility bills. Also there is a security deposit and a minimum occupancy of 6 months usually. 

Buying say a private studio apartment  in 2018, if you want it cheaper would be around the  500k range if you don't mind living somewhere further. That would mean forking out at least 1.5k monthly . Also don't forget you can't loan this at 100% of the cost. On top of that if you have agent that will be cost, other fees and duty to pay too. 

So you need a big chunk of change first, then if you can afford the mortgage, then it might be feasible. Don't forget the loan on top will always change their variable unless it is hdb loan which is fixed at 2.5%. Also I haven't include renovation too. That's another bomb.

e7k592d,Stegles,"You have a few options to address the personal space thing. 

1. Obvious one here is rent somewhere, though this will eat into your potential savings for a house in anything you want to put away on top of your CPF. I know its nice to have cast especially at your age and wages are low, but i wish i saved more when I was younger.  

2. Spend less time at home, you said you have an outdoor hobby which requires space, great, do more of it, spend more time with friends, any study you want to do, do it outside where you can, with less distractions at home you'll get more done.  

3. Suck it up for a couple of years and put every cent you can into savings, get yourself a house deposit together with the goal of buying something. This will mean sacrifice and tolerance but it will give you the most freedom in the long run.  


I feel that Asian family culture with many living under 1 roof greatly increases your ability to save, for me I turned 18 and I was paying rent at home, as well as bills and food. If you can tolerate it a little longer I recommend option 3. If you move to renting you are literally throwing your money away, if you are able to buy a house, even a 2 bdrm, you can rent one out and thats money back into your pocket, reducing the repayment and essentially forcing you to save in the way of maintaining an asset.

do5w4ro,tlakingtoad,"Perhaps it is also important to point out that insurance can be a tricky thing in Singapore. If you sorted out your health insurance early, that's good. But once you have been admitted before it will be hard to get insurance, you can try to not disclose of course but then you get admitted and they will ask since you will likely use the insurance to pay for the hospital stay (aside from your Medisave). Otherwise, pay out of pocket and it's huge. Oh yeah, term insurance and life insurance are also no longer possible. 

Without a hospital admission, it may take a while to get an outpatient appointment through a polyclinic referral. Private clinics are really, really expensive. It's okay-ish if it's a psych since you don't need to see them as often. But if you choose private therapists it's painful if you have to go weekly. Public hospitals are subsidised but still, it adds up especially if you're in school/unemployed. "

do6bvzj,SmileIfYouSeeThis,"thank you so so much for sharing this and for using this platform to reach out to those who may really need it. i've been there once and i'm sure there are at least a few of us still at this point judging by the recent posts calling for help. to all those in distress: *seeking help is the first step to recovery*, and yes, **you will get there.** all the best! 

even for those non-suicidal but still mentally troubled people, i'd urge you to seek help too like the OP says. mental health is paramount, and lays the foundation for a truly healthy life. "
do75slg,Pega-ace,"Thank you so much for sharing this, as someone who was just diagnosed with clinical depression a few months ago and is struggling with it through my IB exams coming in a few weeks, I'm glad that maybe others will get help earlier and not have to live through this stuff... Now if only I could convince my parents..."
do7l7z0,Muggerchugger,"Thanks for sharing!

Just a personal psa from a dude with adhd: if you feel it in you that you have some uncontrollable urges in you that makes a noticeable decrease in your quality of life, urges that make you seem or feel out of place, like you don't belong; if you feel a sense of dread and hopelessness that you can just never change or fit in; if you have any inclination that you might need psychiatric help but are just afraid of repercussions like costs or other people finding out or even shame in general

Just seek help. It will help you greatly if you need it and if you turn out to not need it there arent really any consequences. Wish I hadnt pointlessly worried about seeking help earlier and I hope anyone reading this in need of help wont either. If you find yourself unable to stop daydreaming even in high-stress situations or completely unable to sit still - you know what to do "
do64ecv,okaycan,[I want you guys to be alive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb24RrHIbFk) 
do5rx8i,doctorwhybother98,"That's a tricky one, isn't it? It's mingled with so much shame and stigma, even self-afflicted ones, that sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. The best answer would be that a consultation with a psychiatrist would be able to help you understand whether or not you're actually depressed of if it's the latter. 

If it's the latter that's been causing you distress, then you shouldn't beat yourself up over it but try to take small steps to improve yourself as a person. Psychotherapy can aid you in doing so if you wish. Psychotherapy gives us the tools and makes us stronger and braver to confront and deal with our issues. I highly recommend checking out what Dr Jordan Peterson has to say about dealing with mental health - and life - issues [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5QRiJZ0Go) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7E_4c_s9y8) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuQgJxYriYI) [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GSf5cYCvE&list=PL_K7XH1AIG8z6Vh8DjwUHCDoXHMf9bMLZ&index=4) [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSV5KJqSlFY) [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFeIRVueNRM) [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJxcLyg3-Q) [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU) [9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0) [10](https://youtu.be/v0Qm8I2cCAE) [11](https://youtu.be/XbOeO_frzvg)]. He's helped me change my perspective on mental health and some others quite a lot. His advice has been indispensable to me and has been largely responsible for getting me to try to put my life back on track. "
do5qn2x,swimNotsink,"Is it affecting your daily routines? basically seek help if you think you can't recover on your own. in your example, a question to ask yourself would be 'can I get out of this guilty loop that only worsens?'. if you don't think you can, then seek help. And yes, it is as simple as that. Because of the stigma of seeking mental professional help, things that can be nipped in the bud quickly usually end up snowballing into something serious (which is the bulk of what is portrayed in the media sadly). so if you think nothing is working, seek help ! early intervention like counselling/therapy can save you alot of cost."
do5yrl2,tlakingtoad,"I think that no matter if it's the former or latter, you should always treat yourself with kindness. Sometimes we don't measure up to whatever society deems as a productive person but really the only way out is treat yourself kindly, not beat yourself up, and find your way. "

do5vzk1,tlakingtoad,"IMH can be a very horrid place, it's seen as a last resort type of institution from what I've gathered from other patients. Mental healthcare in general can be very frustrating anywhere. You will meet psychiatrists who will, it seems, just throw pills at the wall until one sticks. In the process, you may be on a cocktail of drugs some with side effects you will need additional medication to counteract. Therapists, I've found, are not the most trained either. Certain therapies that are being utilised in other developed nations have not made their way here and you really have to demand to see specific doctors/professionals to get the right treatment. And if you have a cluster B disorder, it's even worse because you are seen as having something ""incurable"" and are therefore hopeless. But this is also a problem with mental healthcare in general, the field is constantly changing and certain disorders have a lot of stigmas which the experts themselves exhibit. Hence what you saw with regards to the staff at IMH. "
do6omv6,y08hci0299,"Your second and third paragraph are spot on, I'm glad I'm not the only one to feel that way. I actually checked myself into a C Class ward a few years ago for a panic attack and your observations are dead on. The nurses came across as prison wardens and were extremely rude to the patients, and the entire place came across as a prison or an asylum to keep 'the crazies' locked in for the benefit of society rather than for their recovery and rehabilitation. The sad part is that quite a few of the patients are so far gone that they don't even realise they are being mistreated. The moment I walked into the ward and saw how things were like I made a hell lot of noise and got myself discharged in 5 hours. The funny part is, the day right after I got admitted and discharged I was out in town running some errands and I bumped into one of the nurses who was rude to me, we made eye contact and she looked like she had seen a ghost."
do5xmsh,doctorwhybother98,You could also get a referral through the A&E of a public hospital which may get you an earlier appointment than from a polyclinic referral. I'm not too sure about health insurance so I'm afraid I can't say anything about that.

do5yhdx,tlakingtoad,"No. I just have many years in the system. Cluster B are personality disorders, the especially difficult type, the most famous ones are Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. When people refer to ""sociopaths"" they are likely talking about people with Antisocial Personality Disorder or even NPD. A number of 'difficult' women will get the diagnosis of BPD and this is quite a contentious subject considering it is sometimes a lazy diagnosis and patients with that tend to be dismissed more often than given the support they need. They are definitely hard to treat however, especially when comorbid with other mental illnesses. "

It's just such a slow and painful death. She was from RGS but went poly, and father is elite. I wonder if it's just another tragic case of facing pressure from her social circle for not taking the path society laid out for her, so she fell into depression. On a side note, antidepressants are also notorious for causing suicides."
csgt4v2,shaunwjh,"He didn't do it because of stress over examinations. He did it because he was depressed and had no one to express his thoughts to. He's constantly bullied because he's gay.

He's a very nice boy and I've met him before. May he rest in peace."

Sometimes, I thought to myself…… humanity means nothing when no one cares about you, so why not just die and all the pain will go away? I'am still left with 4 days before school reopens. Facing the same old shit routine. Perhaps, there might be some of you out there who wants to suicide but don't have the guts to do it. I've just read this post and just created this account to comment here.i know myself best, I'am not afraid to die, I'am just afraid that where will I go after death. Definitely not hanging for me, i prefer quick and painless death. Jumping from a high HDB might solve my problem.

csgor7k,PsauL,"> Would like to take this post to tell the suicidal/ depressed people of /r/Singapore that you're not alone and there's always someone to talk to in time of needs. 

The down vote say otherwise... frankly and I'm not joking... It's part of the bullying in this society that drives people to this thoughts. To admit, about 1-2 years ago, I had the same thought too while being inside a deep collective corporate bullying.

But surviving it makes me stronger, even if learning this after almost 3 decades of my life. 

Things that doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Things that do kill you, and it's all over.

Lastly, rather than coming up with ""we'll talk to you everything, we'll help you"", I rather highlight those with genuine intentions and skills to handle those with depression. It is certainly not helping (and could worsen the matters) if one is not trained, or worse, with malicious intention. **The amount of down votes seen here urge me to advise against using /r/Singapore as a platform to solve your depression**"

csgllw4,tsukuruu,"When the source is ALLSINGAPORESTUFF I am hesitant, but I guess this news was lifted off from one of the Chinese evening dailies.

Some highlights:

> Police have confirmed they are investigating the case as ""unnatural death"".

There's the potshot for the establishment.

> You wanna know why he hung himself? Let's look at the clues. He was Secondary 4. What is the most depressing thung about being 16 in SG? O Levels. My guess is the stress and pressure to do well caused him to crack and kill himself. Surely there must be some other way to stream people, we are a modern, 21st century first world country, not the 70s.

Also, comments that are tabloid worthy. An analysis of the situation that correlates a suicide with stressful education system because... we have an antiquated system? Does not compute."

The victim thought no one cared for him but actually you can see, there are many people that are willing to care for him. School is shitty for now but it’s a phase everybody has to get thru. I know you are able to do it man, just think. 9months before you were born, you were stronger than the rest of the sperms fighting for a chance to live. You are the strongest among them. Always remember that.

e5pz1ch,ordlohhhh,"The only way you're gonna acquire any skills are by going out and learning through alot of hard work. Everyone had to start out somewhere. Maybe start small? Try looking for an internship at a company that might not stress you out so much(ask around for people who've had experience in places without so much pressure etc). If you don't try, it's really hard to learn anything. Jiayou we're all struggling "
e5pzxqn,edlaz,"Seen somewhere on Reddit:
https://i.redd.it/ojjikt3akdl11.jpg

Before you worry about the future, give yourself a chance to have a future. 

Base case: survive today. If you can learn something new today, that's awesome. If you make a mistake today, learn from it. If you can improve on something, however miniscule, is a step forward. 

Skills don't happen overnight.

"
e5q1gum,michaelflux,"Here's a few suggestions I would give ...

1) If you intend on going into some specific career path/job, you can start acquiring most of those skills even on your own, even at home - don't be one of those people that shows up on the first day of work and barely even understands what the company does or anything about the industry - do your research.  These days you're seconds away from having access to anything and everything you can think of.

2) Don't overthink it and find yourself paralysed from the panic of feeling unprepared. Go in, and ask questions, ask questions, ask questions, then ask some more questions.  More often than not it's not about what you know, it's about how quickly you can learn on the job. Don't just do the minimum required for your job - go out of your way to understand how the work that you're doing fits into the bigger picture, how it relates to all other processes in the company.

3) As someone who has hired, fired and managed plenty of plenty over the years - believe me when I say that almost everything you learn in uni is going to be useless - don't care if you were homeschooled or went to Harvard.  Most people for whom it's their first job, have no idea what they're doing. The ones that think they know what they're doing are often the biggest headaches to deal with.  The people who do the best and get promoted the fastest are the ones who are constantly asking questions and trying to understand things outside of their immediate responsibilities.

4) Spend 10x more time listening than talking."
e5q0xmo,meepokkk,Am still in uni as well but internship is really a great avenue to pick up skills! Don’t be afraid to try! I didn’t have any skills that were relevant to my internship in the beginning as well but people are generally nice and patient and very willing to impart their knowledge if you ask :)
e5rpql9,WittyKap0,"Honestly, most jobs call for such specific skills that no one can just drop in and do their job immediately.

You may be surprised but literally Googling ""how to do X"" will solve the problem for you in 80-90% of the cases, unless it requires a specialized prerequisite skill set (eg law, economics, programming).

I have minimal knowledge of Excel yet can create the pivot tables, vlookups, charts I need on the off chance, just by Googling. It works for other stuff as well, like how to present a sales report, presentation, etc."
e5qcd2e,lydialamsph,"I also have a depression diagnosis and was on meds for it. It’s very normal to be having these worries that you have. For me, a lot of the technical skills I use at work I picked up on the job. It’s actually very different from what I studied in school, and I’m glad for that because I wasn’t a very good student at all but a much better worker.

When you start out as a fresh grad people know you’re a fresh grad and they don’t expect you to know everything immediately. At least, the reasonable employers don’t. As long as you have a good attitude and work hard you’ll be fine, and if you’re not, just try another job until you find something that fits.

No point worrying about paying off your school fees - just get out there and do your best and if you falter go back to your doc, it’s fine to be back on your meds."
e5qkndc,wakkawakkaaaa,"Forced myself to take interships and learn stuff on the job. As an undergrad/fresh grad, most companies will moderate their expectations and generally give you time to ramp up your productivity.

Please take good care of your mental health and seek help if you need it! Don't need to worry too much about the skill/exp gap which will be bridged in time! "
e5rvwwf,vani77a,"Most of the time, you will find the skill you need for your job *in your job*.  
The single, most important skill you need for any job is the capacity and willingness to learn.  

Internship would probably boost your hireability by a fat margin, especially if your grades are not so great. Also, it could give you a sense of direction career-wise.

School will just provide you with the basic knowledge you need for chosen career, but for everything else, you will need to school yourself on the job.

Also, maybe try to find family/friends to support you, both for your mental state, and career choice. Good luck :)"
e5q28ip,rheinl,"dont worry dude. if you arent suitable for the job, the interviewer will weed you out. when you do get in, someone thinks you can do the job so just remember that"
e5rycnx,NecroHexr,"That's one of the worst quotes I've ever seen.

""Don't worry, dude in a car crash! You may be paralysed from waist down, but you survived!"""
e5r36u1,onetimethrowaway94,I'm sort of afraid because I can't even handle excel properly which is like a basic skill they would expect I guess...
e5r9rr3,lydialamsph,Take a class to learn it! I can’t Excel either (lol) but thankfully my job doesn’t require me to. What I mean is - there is usually a solution if you look hard enough :)
e5rwfwt,vani77a,"Excel is the mysterious magic stick of almost bottomless wonders. Just start somewhere, and learn as you go along :)"
dgwznv3,shadowheron,"You could start with a medical history from a qualified psychiatrist. Then you could apply to the school to perhaps give you a gap year for you to rest. I think they will give it to you if you have a medical history, they won't be taking responsibility if something happen to you."
dgxgszq,myepicdemise,Yes it's possible. Letter from a public psychiatrist is important.

dgx8r8t,ceddya,"Yes, it is, and there are various routes for you.

If you're seeing a psychiatrist, he should be able to write to your JC to explain the situation. You can also go through your school counsellor who can then assist you with applying for one. Alternatively, your parents can also contact your JC directly and set up an appointment with the relevant person(s) to help you with a LOA application."
dgxgmu8,xwnatnai,"Do it. In the long run losing a year here or there doesn't mean jack shit. Take the year off, and finances permitting, go and do something you actually want to do. Learn something. Whatever strikes your interest. Formal education is completely useless anyway. Don't ever sacrifice your sanity for it. A levels are so easy you'll easily ace them with a clear head. Sure you could get a prescription for an SSRI and tough it out, but would you rather lose a year and get straight As or do it now and get a mix of As and Bs?"
dgx1we7,wasteofrice,"I think it's best to call someone of authority in your school that you can trust to tell it to and believe you, on a personal level. Any of your teachers, or school counsellor even. It's always better to work things out with someone than by yourself because seeing a psychiatrist on your own for the first time may be a little daunting. Work it out with someone, you may not even need a formal letter if your teacher has a way to arrange it for you. 

Hang in there and good luck :)"
dgxljab,HidingCat,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you're having issues. Do see your school counsellor so you can highlight all that and begin the process of taking a leave of absence. Please take care ok? Get well soon!"
dgx1tc7,Marcovanrooy,Yes it's possible. Just go up to a teacher you're comfortable with and tell him or her about it. Or just go up straight to your principal and be truthful about it. I know how hard A Levels are but you'll definitely do well even tho it might not be right now. Take a break when you need to.
dgx8pio,HajaKensei,"\^This

Adding onto that, are your parents aware and supporting your decision? If yes, then just see a psychiatrist, tell him everything including the fact that you want a gap year. He needs to know everything and what you want before he can officiate a letter addressed to your school. Talking to your school counsellor would only end up involving a lot of people trying to convince you to stay, and possible alienation if they treat you abnormally(speaking from my personal experience so it may differ)

Speaking of personal experience, I too had a gap year when I was young after O levels, due to my MDD getting more severe. Gap year doesn't mean being at home alone everyday, wanking off to games or sleeping 16 hrs a day. It will just become more severe. You need to have a hobby, and people around you supporting you to have a breather and actually improve.

Chin up bro, Idk what's the root cause, but my friend once told me ""No matter how long it rains, eventually the Sun will rise and it'll be a good day again."" You are your biggest enemy, don't hold yourself down for things that won't even take up your mind a few years down the road. Jy jy    "

dgxk37p,idiot321321321,"I second this. That's what they are here for.

Also, see the cousellor before you see a professional psychiatrist. It's like seeing a GP first instead of going straight to a specialist- the counsellor might help you pinpoint the problem and solutions etc."
d8gh58s,finishingthetea,"I'm not sure how your GP will take it, but mine prescribed a short course of anti-anxiety meds when I was losing my mind to work stress (I think he could tell how bad it was based on how I detailed my physical/mental condition to him). So it's definitely possible, but not sure how much ""fuss"" you'd consider that to be. YMMV though. "
d8gix8o,teamaniac,"Go to the polyclinic. Some doctors especially those who does family medicine should be able to help with a short dose of antidepressant. Even if they can't, they can refer you to one of the government hospitals. It does not have to be IMH. Just keep it to yourself, go for the appointment, ask the psychiatrist to prescribe 1st generation medication which will be relatively affordable. Talking about 1 month prescription at max dose not costing more than $30. Remember to change your next of kin number to someone you can trust in case the appointment SMS goes to your parents' hp. "
d8gi5bh,Acataeono,I Used to take some. I really don't know if gps hand out anti depressants. Best you return to your therapist and ask. I'm sorry you're going through a stressful time. Its difficult and alot of people don't understand. Hang in there.
d8gs2vw,Nabadaba,"From personal experience, polyclinic doctors can give you a short course of pills, especially if you've taken them before, but will refer you through the system to a govt psych guy "
d8gzv14,dyliecious,"Easily? Short term family clinic should be ok. But if you want to actually achieve results, short term is not enough. Psychiatric meds take a couple of weeks to get into gear must be taken consistently to maintain their effects. 

So suggestion, get a polyclinic doctor to give you a referral to gh psych (got subsidy) and some meds to tide you to your appt. I think polyclinic can even help you set the appt? 

Therapy if you feel doesn't help you or is too much of a time investment, actually entirely optional. 

Source: Psychotic depression. I see my psychiatrist every 2-3 months and haven't been to therapy for over a year now. "
d92nnbi,gabehcood,"Update in case there are people who are googling/reddit search-ing for any answers: 
I ended up speaking to a trusted teacher who encouraged me to go to the school counsellor, and after much hesitation, I finally did. She gave a me a list of psychiatrists, but there was one GP in particular she mentioned that stocked psych meds (because not all of them do/are trained specially for dealing with mental distress cases). So firstly I'd want to encourage anyone struggling to not try to handle their issues on their own (easier said than done, I know) because you'd really be surprised at how many people do genuinely care for you, even complete strangers like the GP I just met. There's no shame in asking for help, I'm always open to PMs if that helps anyone."

crrqt3r,centrifugalfield,"Hey OP,

I don't know if someone as young as I am is qualified to give advice, but take what you will...

You've basically made a post on reddit asking for help, then dismissed all the advice people give you. Cmon...

The easiest way to live life is to not care too much. Now I'm not saying you should go to school dressed in a singlet and sweatpants, and sleep in lectures. Just do what you have to do, and don't sweat the small stuff.

So what if a few people leave your life? They wouldn't have been good friends anyway. So what if someone hates your guts? Who're they in the long run? Who is anyone in the long run? 

Think of one popular person in your workplace/school. Don't you hate his guts? Does he care? Think of it this way: for every one person who hates you, there are several others who think you're the bees knees.

I'm not going to say that our lives are completely alike. But I can see some similarities between us. Granted, I had social anxiety for very different reasons. But I, and everyone I know who's had social anxiety got over it by simply not caring as much. It won't go away overnight, but over time you'll realise ""I wouldn't have done this 3 months ago"". It's a long process. But it's one you have to undergo if you want to be a productive adult in modern society. 

P.S. it helps if you aren't in a competitive environment.

Just relak ah bro..."

Put down the negative thoughts. You are like carrying a heavy school bag, you can put down that bag. You will feel better. 

Everyone needs a break, just like my handphone, always need to recharge. Watching youtube to relax is not a bad idea. 

As long as you have a healthy body, you can do anything you want. Continue you meetings with your school counsellor. 


2 & 3 : You have a fear of something. For certain things/situations the way to overcome it, is to face is head on.  I am also introverted. Talk to people. You can progress slowly. Today talk to 1 person. Tmrw talk to 2 person. Talk about anything also can. It can be as simple as telling Ali that his wallet is very nice looking.  

Think positive. If you feel that everything is good and peaceful, you actions will hv a good outcome. If you keep thinking you are not confident, your behaviour will correspond to that. "

crsrdtg,cldw92,"With regards to procrastination: Turn off your internet/computer while you study.

With regards to socializing: Practice talking. This sounds stupid but talk to everyone you see. That auntie you buying chicken rice from at the hawker centre, your neighbours who you never talk to in the lift, say hi to cleaning auntie/uncle, say hi to the buskers who are playing music at shopping centres. Talk to EVERYBODY and soon it'll become such a habit that you won't have trouble at all. Just give them a ""Good morning, Singapore's weather DAMN HOT RIGHT?""

With regards to forming deeper relationships: Hang out with people way older than you, their maturity might change your mind on issues of trust and etc. You'll find some people aren't worthy of trust, but on the other hand some older people can be really responsible and can really reshape your view of how interpersonal relationships work. Besides, they're a huge source of information and wisdom.

Last resort: Hang out with me, I just judged you so interactions with me can't possibly get any worse right? "

I would like to give you a comprehensive reply, but I can only get to it at the end of the week as I am currently having exams too.

If it is not too much trouble, do you mind sharing with us the following details:

 * Examples of your low self-confidence/esteem
 * Examples of your poor socializing experiences/interpersonal skills
 * Examples of your strong distrust of people and possible reasons behind these
 * Any concrete vision/goals of what you would like to achieve or who you want to be with respect to the issues you have faced
 * If you can only work on one specific issue, which would that be?

Along with the many replies in this thread, I think it will be immensely helpful to provide us with more details because the direction of your post seems rather unfocused.

In the meanwhile, all the best for your exams!"

crsq86y,Cylencer,"Everyone procastinates to an extent. It's just your low self-esteem causing you to think that ""oh shit i spend too much hours doing useless crap i should be doing something worthwhile i guess im just useless after all"". You need to break out of this cycle of negative thinking. It's okay to be doing something to relax and take mind off your school work. For you, that would be watching youtube. For others, it would be playing video games, watching dramas, etc. 

As for your social anxiety, just know that people are actually more concerned about themselves than they are about other people. Nobody has you on their mind all the time. As for topics to talk about, you can read the news. Or even reddit. Like for example, ""so i read this article on reddit, it's quite interesting, it has this etc, etc."" Or you can think of something that links to their hobbies/interests and take it from there. People would be more enthusiastic to talk about their interests. I would also recommend reading the book ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Dale Carnegie. This book helped me a lot.

In conclusion, don't give up. You've already taken the first step by seeking help. Set small relastic goals for yourself and don't overthink. I've been (actually I still am, though it's better now ever since I enlisted) in your shoes, so I understand what you're going through. "
crstwdq,,"Hi OP, whether you like it or not, you have to learn to be social by hook or by crook by the time you leave school. The outside (even in school) is really full of people who will see your shyness and as a weakness and spread nasty rumors about you. 

How did I know? I know someone, quite nice, but extremely quiet. There was nasty rumors about him being a pervert by taking pictures of many lower secondary schoolgirl's skirt after his phone was so called ""confiscated"" by the teacher. It rage throughout the school and his gf dump him thinking that he is a lewd pervert. The only solution I see is to develop strong friendship so that you will have many pair of eyes and ears looking out for you.

And the rumor spreader snatched his gf away... all's fair in love and war? You may not have a gf to lose, but you have your career to lose. "

I am also a girl with very poor self esteem and facing some social anxiety too. I found a meetup group quite a while ago that may be useful to you. you can download the meetup app. There's a group called "" depression and introversion support and friends social anxiety"". The reviews have been quite good.  You could hang out with people having the same issue and then slowly learn to interact with other people. Btw which uni are you from? 

I also face the same issue like you. Dont be disheartened. I am from nus and also not doing well in school for my past two semesters because of lack of focus and feeling lonely etc. feeling like a failure too. I have decided to transfer to an australian university to restart and hopefully learn to open up myself there. 

Believe that you will change eventually. The prefrontal cortex of the brain actually matures later at 25 years old, so it will get better and you will have a different perspective as you grow older and have more experiences interacting with people. "

I find it easier to talk to people after a while when I start to ask them a few questions everyday, whether the questions are relevant to each other is another story. I used to be afraid of what they may think of me but I won't know what they are actually thinking until I talk to them.

About making friends:

Common interests and habits usually help people to make friends with each other, because at the very least you guys can become acquaintances haha. After that it's more reliant on chemistry between the two of you, whether you can get along, whether you think like each other, etc. Join a CCA in school, go to events and stuff and put yourself out of your comfort zone. 

If you don't dare to move out of your comfort zone, that's the problem - you're too afraid to chase after anything, and too lazy to expend the effort required to do so. Nothing's really going to come easy.

Anxieties in general - it's okay to worry. I worry a lot too. I kind of realized that the things I worry about never seem to happen, and that it's always the unexpected things (things that will not occur to you, even in your worrying) that really gets me, so.. I guess it's all down to attitude? 

Just tell yourself that for whatever you do, everything can be reduced to a series of steps - 小事大事都一步一步做就是了. After all, 船到桥头自然直. Haha. So even though you're worrying a lot, try to be able to put those thoughts aside and move, step by step, to achieve what you want.

I also know that change needs to happen progressively, small steps at a time, but for me, this period of time in my life seems to be full of changes, something which may be hard for me to deal with: I compare myself to that of "" a tortoise who has spent most of its life cooped up in its shell, only to peer its head out into the vast world now"" "

dnkmcdg,butterflyknives,"So from someone who was you, 8 years ago. 

Bad relationship blah blah, so I didn't want to go to class at all, and well my gpa died. This led to me fighting with my parents as they believed my grades were because of computer games (i switch skirt-chasing hours into LoL hours). I didn't think they believed that my gpa is because of a relationship, and didn't feel like telling them (they never wanted me to have one). 

I had a few suicidal attempts, to the point I would write a contract with my parents on how to parent me. They sign or I go. It got so bad that I ran away from home, 8 days before my internship to graduate at all.

I talked to people. Not parents or counselors or psychologists (seen them all tho). I talked to people, friends. Their friends friends. The one thing friends can give you what professionals cannot, is that some friends are in worst states than you. You literally talk to them and feel how pointless my problem was.

I told myself. Ok look this suicide thing won't fix shit. I think on like the 8th day, if I did not report to school, that's my graduation. I went up to the highest floor, completely sober. Had to do it sober. I told myself, ok if you think your problems are unsolvable. Jump. Do it. 

I stared blank at the sky for a good minute, then I went back to my friend's house. Tomorrow still going to happen, tomorrow you drag yourself to internship. What's the point? You can't be lucky or see the change in winds by being dead. Stick it out another 6 months. I mean, live out the hell a little longer. Does it matter if you die today or tomorrow?

And I told myself. Ok I'll kill myself next week. Next week man, next week. At least go and spend finish your money on steak. Get wasted on drugs or something. Die with a big bang. That made me happy to continue. Big bang death. 

The more I thought about it, the more I needed this big bang. I couldn't just die now, 2 weeks into internship. Kinda lame no?

It kept me ""safe"" for six months until I graduated. And halfway, my director sat me down and explained to me my options. There was but 1 option I had. So perhaps I was lucky, perhaps you may not have the same fortune.

But it took me 4 months living through hell to find the golden ticket. 4 months thinking, planning, deciding, my death. And suddenly, things were a TINY bit better.

I'm not going to say life turned out better for me. Army was bliss. But after army.... In university, I formed a suicide pact with an online stranger. I couldn't finish school, finished the rest of it at home, doing online classes.

I wouldn't say still that life became better.

After graduating half a year late, I worked in FnB for 2 years, unable to find a job. Unfortunately, I somehow convinced the stranger that life was pretty fun. She cancelled the pact. So damn, there goes my not-dying-alone plan.

I finally am working, but again, I still wouldn't say I'm okay. I was an alcoholic smoker. I burnt my health freely on purpose.

right now? I can't say life is good. but hey, I got a girlfriend smarter than me, im either an alcoholic or smoker now (so i either drink today or have a cigarette, but some days i can drink for a week and be clean on cigarettes. actually managed to quit smoking for a bit, first time in 8 years). surviving all those years? 8 years of hell, but hey i also now have 8 years of fantastic awesome memories. i hate life still, but i also love life too.

But you know, as much as im struggling now, right now, if you ask me, was it worth keeping myself alive? putting myself through all the mental breakdowns that i saw coming a mile away? the tearing apart of my family, the isolation of my friends. 

Yes. Yes it was worth it. Because if I ever could have a chat with you over some coffee, you wouldn't be hearing the pain I went through for 8 years making the decision to live. You'll hear of all my marvelous tales while we laugh about the events I've been through. At the end of the day you'll be like ""wow he's pretty awesome.""

Did you know I broke down laughing when I went to get a tattoo? So hard the artist scolded me cuz he kept laughing. So hard the manager came out to see what was happening and broke out laughing. 

And so many more of these stories. But hey, at 18, standing there at the ledge. My god. Ask me back then if I wanted to kill myself? Yes the intent is fully there. I did not forsee how I could have ended up where I am now. 

So my advice to you? Life can't get better if you're dead. Life may not get better while you're still alive, but hey, it can. not all the time. but it can. and sometimes, the little times that it can, makes you feel happy for living that long to experience it. 

Edit: Lemme write some happier stories and have a virtual coffee with you all in stuck mrts.

#1 The Singaporeanism is real.

I was overseas and found two NUS people, who somehow decided to invite me on their ocean road trip. I, was the specific reason why while hiking, I misled 80% of the people going downhill. Im the reason we got lost basically, all because of square rocks (i said, hey that's a square rock. singapore don't have square rocks. wow. so i mean if this is the first time im seeing it, then obviously this wasn't the way we went up, since then I would have noticed it. so it must be this other way. fuck. my. logic. LOL). so ok halfway we realize we are lost and have no idea where we are. 

this german girl has a gopro cam, and she starts doing the whole ""last moments caught on tape before death"" with the i love you mummy daddy stuff. camera got passed around. The dutch, british, american, two australians, all did that i love you thing. the camera was passed to us. all three of us did not start with i love you. we all started with ""ok remember to fill out the insurance form to take the money for our deaths. i've transferred mine to ntuc so you can just call them up, the number on their website etc... oh and i love you mummy daddy"" 

One of the dutch people was like ""oh damn singaporean students are so... amazing even in the face of death. your *parents must have been so glad* to have you guys as their children""

uhhh... HAHAHA. thanks singapore. <3


#2 Ultimate Lazy Technique for army (im office boy)

I used to be late to work for army. Everytime I'm late, I sign one guard duty. in office, guard duty refers to coming in at 7am and book out 6.30pm (normal time is 8am or something, im always late, i don't remember what the exact time is. that's how often i am and 5.30pm is the normal time everyone books out). How bad was it? Guard duty by
right is rotated among everyone assuming nobody kena guard duty (and normally nobody kena. at most 1 month the Mdm give out 2-3 guard duties as punishment).

I remember that month had 31 days. I did 31 days of guard duty. 

The day after I finally finished my 31-day course, im just milling about the office (im admin) so then the dental Mdm comes up and starts yelling where the newspaper was. Im like oh fuck that is my job (admin job is pick up newspaper everymorning from downstairs). She sees me. FUCK GG. She turns to the guy doing guard duty and scolds him. HE GETS UP TO TAKE NEWSPAPER. wait what?? HE APOLOGIZES. ???

Next day I observe. The person assigned to guard duty picks up the newspaper as well. I've been doing guard duty so long that everybody, including the ranking staff, assumed it was the guard to pick up newspaper. I've never picked it up since for the next 19 months.

Holyshit talk about lazy. I always laugh whenever the guard picks up the newspaper thereon. It took 21 months for my best friend (ah, i never had one before. 21 year old then get best friend. if i died at 18... haha die without having known a best friend. really sia. best friends are fun to have) to figure out it was MY job. he also uhm... found out that about the 25 extra things he does is also my job. to the point he did his own investigation and realize uhm....

i give him do everything that is my job that i lazy to do. which is. everything.

later on, about 5-6 years, in a way, i saved his life too. apparently the longer you live, the more lives you save or something. i've saved about 4 lives since from suicide. and all not on purpose one. they just... decide to keep living. don't even know why. i specifically rejected the counselling course in psychology when i was studying for my diploma/degree so im definitely 100% uncertified to counsel. it's there on my resume. failed counselling module.

HAHAHA. i know. it's just funny to me. well. today i put on my nice looking shirt that i took from my brother cuz i have no taste in clothes, and im off to a business meeting (lolol look at mr lazy going for meeting), and i have a shitton of work to do until monday. im reluctantly a relatively functioning working adult now. or something. 

time to drag myself out of the house, just like i did, 8 years ago. :D

dnkki9s,denatured_enzyme_,"have you tried talking to your parents? they're probably just concerned that you won't do well. Tell them it's 2017, things have changed, you will not crash and burn just cuz you do arts and humanities. Tell them that in any case if you don't do well you'll probably have to remodule or sth and that's just a waste of time cuz you're just doing the same shit again when you alr know you can't muster up the passion to do it.

That being said, if they're still really stubborn, then try to make the best out of your situation. Ik it's easier said than done, but in cases like this where you can't change the situation, you've got a choice whether you want to go through it happily or suicidal-y (?). And I'm pretty sure most people would want to be happy, given a choice. So make it happen for yourself. Look at things from the bright side. If you can't find one, then try. If you need to talk, you can pm me (: always happy to help out.

And whatever you do, do not take your own life.

Good luck OP (: jiayou! "

dnkknwr,KimJiHoon,"let me tell you my background, i have a N level cert and NITEC in precision engineering but i found out that the industry is infested with foreigners who are cheaper, faster and better than me. so i exit that industry and ask my friend if he has any lobang for me. And he pull me in to work in back end banking line. i started with account opening dept, the pay is average but enough to get by or start a career. after 1 year i switched to sales supports thats where i see banking in a different perspective. after 3 years in that dept i switch to cheque processing. So basically i have a shitty paper but im able to jump around. so its still possible. Probably you can try getting a entry level job first then plan on what you wanna do next. at least you have a monthly income. Cheer up. jia you!~"
dnkl8ig,requiem2104,"As a father with a daughter, let me give you my perspective. I love my girl more than anything in the world. I'm sure your parents feel the same for you. It seems like perhaps you have shut yourself emotionally from them, due to fear of disappointment, scolding, depression. Please when you are feeling down and suicidal, always remember that a parent's love is unconditional, and not contingent on you doing well in school, holding a great job etc. Do try to communicate with your parents, connect on an emotional level, don't be afraid to show your insecurities and fears. Also, having come through the system and pretty much aced everything through uni and post-grad, you will find that success and especially wealth has very little to do with results or your education cert, but more to do with how rugged and how mch you are willing to work for your success.
Again, please don't commit suicide. I would die if I knew my daughter was considering something like that. Please try to talk to your parents, and if you need more help feel free to PM me."

dnklj4b,OmeletteOnRice,"Try talking to your parent and ask to drop out of poly to go jc arts stream. I think it is very clear by now that you are not cut out to be banker. 

Not going into banking is not end of the world but being miserable over what you are doing with your life is pretty close. 

Personally, i was pressured into applying for arts stream when i was applying for jc but the next morning i woke up and it just felt wrong so i decided to change it without telling anyone. I only told them after the deadline is over. Hands down best decision i made in my life. 

I might sound irresponsible for saying this because i dont know how pushy your parent are but at times you must stand up for what you believe in. Your life is your own, at the end of your days you are only truly answerable to yourself. Make decisions that allows you to feel satisfied when you look back on your life.

dnkprbs,Ferzone,"You can sweep the road and still read history. You can sell chicken rice in the day and still read history. You can do anything and still read history for a hobby, if you like it it's your passion. Whether or not you get to do it for work will depends on luck and chance. Not many people know exactly what they want growing up.  And even lesser actually do what they actually want growing up. But they still can have a family and be happy. It depends on how much you want to fight for it. But at the end if you end your life over a fucking number that people assign to you based on things you're not interested in then you'll never be able to do what you actually want. That's like me giving Joseph schooling a test on semiconductors. (Stupid like it sounds ) That's on you, denying yourself the chance. GPA although significant , does not determine everything you do in life. You fight hard as hell to keep a good GPA but then later in life you realized that it's actually the friendships or social skills that help. Or even the process of studying / managing your time. Poly is a stepping stone. It might be difficult . But never ever let a number determine your life. PM me if you need someone to talk to. Take care and I wish you all the best "
dnkno98,ScarletGaze,"Hi OP, hopefully you get to read this. It's easy to get overwhelmed when there is parental pressure, peer pressure and whatsoever pressure you face. However the biggest problem is you giving yourself too much pressure.  

I always tell people this: ""If you can do something about it, just do your best. If you can't, don't worry yourself sick over something you can't possibly change"".  

It may seem naive to not think about the future in our competitive country. But learn to start investing in yourself, do what you can to improve yourself. You have to start loving and respecting yourself, then can we expect others to do the same. Everyone has their own pace in life, don't bother chasing. People with ADHD take even 8 years to finish college with people labelling us as lazy and ourselves thinking we are just incompetent.  

Small victories, they should always be celebrated. That way you don't lose sight of your progress as a person. That way you know how far you've come, how much you've had to go through to get here.  


By the way if you have issues focusing, can't see your next step or just feel like you can't do well, visit /r/ADHD and find out how much they struggle with everyday life and how they celebrate simple things like being able to go through a simple day being able to follow through with their schedule or even the big ones like completing a degree in 8 years where normally it would take 4.

Do what you have to, until you can do what you want to.
Hope you have a great day, live in the moment buddy! :)

dnkldr8,rancidangel,I think working at Mcdonalds is a honorable job. How many people kill themselves for working there? how many people people kill themselves for working in banks and corporations? Think about that real quick. If you gonna kill yourself because of studying banking maybe banking is not for you. Go out there and find a job that you like for fuck sake. PS. Dont kill yourself fam. Avengers Infinity War is next year  
dnklbtt,000010TEN,"GHAHAHA bro your gpa stuck at 2, but mine at 1. Like that how? Your parents just want you to get a JOB in the future man. Look at it this way. You can become a ~~w~~banker and earn mad cash to fund your own artistic/historical journey. I personally am doing engineering that deals with a lot of nanotechnology with a dash of quantum physics, but I enjoy music a lot so I do it on the side. It's a win-win situation with my family, life, and me (even tho I'm stuck at 1 GPA).

But in all seriousness, don't kill yourself over something as small as GPA. The harsh truth is that no matter how much your parents want you live the way they want, mortality catches up on them (and all of us) one day. So just make a compromise till you're out of their lives, or they to your life."

dnklwme,silv3rbl8,"A problem is like a pebble. Held up close to your eye, it obscures everything. See it from the distance of time, it becomes insignificant. Try to keep that in mind when it appears that you are out of options my friend. The road in life is long and to end it prematurely is a disservice to all the things that has yet to happen.

Talk to someone about it - a trusted friend, a school counselor, a family member. Talk to them not about the low GPA but about you wanting to commit suicide over it. The reason for being alive is not about obtaining a perfect GPA (7 billion people on earth and how many do you think have that?). Neither is it about failing.

Your passion is history, mine is too. Pick up books and keep reading them in your spare time (or watch countless history documentaries online!). You don't have to study your passion nor even make it your career. Passion gives us a reason to live and it may be useful for you to keep yourself filled with it now.

Getting into the banking industry with those grades would be difficult at best; but is that really what you want? Speak to your family members and tell them candidly that their expectations is causing you to consider committing suicide. I'm sure they'd rather not lose a child if they knew. Afterall, from their perspective they might see a different potential to what you see for yourself. There's nothing wrong with that but it's important to speak about how it is impacting your feelings.

Work on your social/interviewing skills so that your presentation inspires confidence. If you don't look/seem credible, you don't really have anything else to back it up. Come across hardworking, earnest, humble and hungry. People will give you a chance.

If all else fails, you need to put the pedal to the metal. You might have to start from the bottom (literally entry level shit jobs) and work your ass off. Establish connections, make a good impression, pull yourself up. Maybe after a few years go into a private Uni.

Anything is possible. Good luck. The hard work starts now."

She is 10 years older than the average grad and still in an entry level role, but she made it to her degree and now has the chance at furthering her studies eventually to chase her dream.

Talk to your parents and if they are not supportive then go your own way. Don't kill yourself because you still have a way forward to get to doing humanities even if it might take your twice or thrice as long. Start working, save up and pursue private education. Hell, why not try applying for education overseas? Your path will be the less travelled one but at the end of the day it's not where you start that matters but where you end."

dnkyzd1,MuggleNotes,"Hey, having just a diploma for now is actually fine. I work in HR. They don't care what your GPA is as long as you pass. Heck, I graduated with a 2.2 GPA.

Experience vs qualifications. Companies usually wants experience. If you have a degree with no experience, it's super hard to get a job because degrees usually means managerial jobs. Use your diploma to get a job you like, study part time while working. Even better if they can sponsor you. Climb up the ladder while you're there. Because by then you already have the experience and getting a degree. I have so many friends with a mediocre GPA degree and it's hard for them to get a job because of no experience.

Build your portfolio, explore other opportunities. You say you have a passion for history, go for it after you graduate. Just because your parents chose Banking for you, that doesn't lock you into the field forever.

Please don't feel that you're worse off than anyone because of what you do; we all will walk different paths in life and what works for someone won't work for another, or even in a different time. As I've mentioned before, I know of people with only an O level cert who're certainly doing much better than me; as important as academic papers are, I've come to realise that hard work and drive is just as important. You're still young and have time to find your path, so don't give up now! 

I don't know if you're able to talk to your parents currently, because I don't know how open or stubborn they are; but if you're struggling this bad it may be a better idea to do something else.

Finally do talk to someone else, SOS number is 1800 221 4444, so if you're feeling the urge to commit suicide, please please call them and talk to them. If you're worried about your academics you can also talk to your sschool's counsellor, they may be able to guide you.

dnkpw1d,alt_generic_acct,"The problem with all the counsellors and advices is that you have to grasp them at the level of your first hand understanding. Not just in theory. That is why you do not find them helpful.

I was in a similar situation too, I felt so useless and overwhelmingly guilty of being so useless that i thought my life was of no use. BUT, i felt so useless that i had the urge to repay a huge debt to pay to my parents and friends before i leave this world. Hence i started getting a shitty job and sending money to my parents, helping friends, being kinder to people.. And in the end i felt that i really do have some value to society.

However this requires you stepping back to look at the big picture. Education is but a process in your life. If you can last through the next few years in a simple job i think you'll be able to see what that means."
dnkr29e,xiangusk,"Hi there, parents will be always  disappointed that you are not similar to them. Disappointing parents is a rite of passage. Don't think too much about it. If you dwell on it just think that they are grateful you did not drop out of school to be a teen parent. Or worst be a poet.

I want to share it is not all doom and gloom. I was in a normal course for one year. I did move to express but I was always close to the bottom. My classmates were really good at studying. I manage to get into polytechnic even though my grades could get me to jc. It was not a high ranking jc. I went to polytechnic and was a consistent c performer. My parents could afford for me to attend university in Australia. At that time it was considered buying a degree. At university I was mainly a strong c performer. I did well only in research or assignments. I don't perform well in exams at all. I did a few years of work and decided why not do a masters degree. I did one part time. Again I was a strong c performer. My highlight was my thesis. I was told I got the best marks of my whole class. At work doing a masters is a handicap. Bosses don't like someone who has better educational qualifications than them. 

 Every part of my studying life I thought of suicide. I had strong suicide ideation at university. I didn't tell anyone because if I did it I didn't want to be stopped. But I didn't. Don't know why. Perhaps because I was finally in the final year and I was doing assignments and research. 

I work in a bank. I started as a call center agent. My pay is just like everyone else - disappointingly low. Still that way now. But of course other people will think it is high. It's about perspective because all the people I work with have pay way higher than me. It has not changed for ten years. About half of my work life I lead a team. I still do but the pay and the grade? Seriously the co could do better. 

What I want to tell you is how well you do at school has no bearing on your work life. All you need to do is to just finish it. You will be good at some things. Perhaps not studying but at least you finished it. 
"
dnksu48,Unusualist,"Grades and studies are not the end points in life. While it may seem very important to you currently, on hindsight it will not break you as a person. 

I'd recommend a good communication session with your educated parents if you deem the pressure from them is too much. You'll have to find a way to initiate it and make it fruitful. If intending to communicate, first come up with your intentions. Don't start one without firm outcomes as it will get no where. 

Considering the JC route if you are one who can study sounds really good to me too, if you wish to and think you are able to enter university especially local U. Doesn't matter you are a little later than peers, don't have to mind opinions or judgements from others.

One thing I'd like to share with you, not sure how insightful will it be. To me, there are a few ways I view tertiary education.

1) gain necessary knowledge and skills to specific fields and open up career paths - scientists, engineers, medical, etc.
2) gain necessary non-textbook skills and mature yourself, such as life skills, project skills etc. Think of science degree holders being recruited by local banks. They hire you for their analytical brains and people skills, not what they memorized for exams. 

My elder sis graduated from RP with a low 2+ GPA if I don't recall wrongly, many years ago. She is doing relatively well in F&B and service sector eventually, after 7 years of part time waitress including poly years. Grades are not the end of the world, if you intend to go through your current diploma.

Again, don't be foolish - life is precious. Ending it is selfish and it achieves nothing more than having your parents live a forever self-blaming lives."
dnkughb,ostrichery,"Hey OP, I'm sorry to read about what you're going through. There's tons of advice already on what you can do, so I thought I'd encourage you to pursue what you're interested in cos it's not completely useless. 

I graduated political science and sociology - both completely general degrees and I worried every day that I wouldn't be able to find a job. Like you, I really like history and wars/conflicts and religion. My grades were ok (mainly because I liked what I was studying) and that allowed me to find a well-paying job. 

Now I help out with recruitment for my company and many students ask how they can prepare for our interviews, or whether their degree is relevant for us. My answer is that the subject doesn't matter, it's more whether you have an interest in the work (current affairs) and whether you have a brain. 

So there ARE options if you decide to try the JC/Uni route and study something you like! 

Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions, chat about history or just want to understand how skills in the humanities get used in the working world (as some other post mentioned, it's never about rote memorisation!) 





"
dnl3c30,UncivilisedMonkey,"You don't have to enroll in a course to learn what you like or get a career. A cert is just there to to knock door. Even a humanities degree is just a paper. 

If you like history, read more history, national library is free, nobody's stopping you. Learn to read, learn to write, if you can really write well, you will be in a much better place than a majority of Singaporeans. 

Who says you can't find a good job without a proper diploma or degree? There are plenty of new startups who needs people, take some risk, take a lower starting pay, build your cv from there, while working on your interest. Or offer tuition to secondary or primary school students, last I check it still pays quite well.

Heck, if you can grit your teeth and continue with your diploma, even with a passing grade that's a good enough starting point. Don't let your grades define you, your life is more important than that. "

once you're done, you can make another thread on wanting to commit suicide cause you can't find a job with a history degree 

but that's for another day."
dnm4obv,FluffyPortalWanker,"**Some background**

I did poly doing a course I never liked because it was something foisted on me by my parents. That being said I got a pretty shitty GPA as well and couldn't get into local Uni (Par UniSim) and I ended up going overseas to study.

Ended up studying something I wanted, but then slowly discovered it wasn't something I was still extremely passionate about. Finished uni, came back to Singapore to a pretty dismal economy, ended up working for an MNC in a totally unrelated field (to both poly and uni studies).

**Couple of things you need to know**

I've learnt over the years that the secret to people who ""do well"" in life don't particularly do well because they were extremely passionate about something but because they made it a point to excel whatever task is infront of them. This is whether or not that task is of their own choosing.

Yes you're in a course that bores you, something you're probably disinterested in etc. But to be honest and giving you the hard truth that you need to hear; Getting 2 GPA in poly isn't about passion or competency or even ability. I've seen people who can't rub two brain cells together manage a 3.2 GPA by sheer effort alone, and this is in something like Chemical Engineering. You have to take a good hard look at yourself and determine if you want to continue on this path of doing badly and feeling sorry about it and yourself or finally take the step to owning your problems and rising above it. 

If for example you do not, take comfort that (if you're male) that national service will force you to do so inevitably. 

Also the secret to success isn't grades, despite what you've been taught your entire life about success (in this rather outmoded education system) The secret to success in life is personal excellence. Doing whatever you choose to do with incredible self drive. 

**And what I challenge you to do is:**

1. Make the best of your circumstances. Find a way to score well for the next 1 year of your poly. Talk to lecturers, tell them you're willing to make the best of what you have and ask them to set aside time to help you, go for every consultation and sit through every lecture multiple times.

2. If you're passionate about something in life, excel in it, keep moving forward and don't give yourself excuses. Push yourself to be better at it. For me it was video games and video game economies. I started writing guides, had my own youtube channel at one point and did general numbercrunching/theorycrafting. Prior to finding work I made about 10k USD total from games. It was why I got hired into the job I'm currently at and why I could turn down an opportunity to work at Amazon, it wasn't my grades, its just that I excelled at something.

3. Learn how to think positively, it is the most essential skill in life. You mentioned it already, your parents are well educated and you're probably in the upper to middle crust of Singaporean society. Count your blessings, take a full stock of the opportunities still afforded to you and don't throw them away. Life isn't just about the now but the potential opportunities that it has to offer. I went through my own bout of depression and being suicidal but here I am today working in decent job, making a decent living and engaged to someone I love and cherish. Also from my experience many decent companies will, despite your grades, hire you for your positive mental can-do attitude.

4. Also last but not the least. As I'm about to get married next year and possibly have kids sometime in the distant future it is slowly dawning on me that anyone who's a new parent is just about as lost as a cave man in a physics symposium as to how to raise a child. It's a huge responsibility that most of us aren't ready to take on, and to be honest I don't think anyone is or will be. Your parents did what they thought was right for you given their circumstances and their experiences in life. If they are well meaning and I assume they are, do try to cut them some slack. We all spent the early parts of our lives learning to be workers in this economy, how to survive and put food on the table. Parenthood is something almost all of us weren't trained to do. TL:DR your parents muddled through trying to raise a child the best they could, you will possibly do it to. Love them as much as you can, forgive them of their mistakes and put the past behind. Keep moving forward. 

Wishing you all the best."
dnpdo8y,ydkm1234,"dont worry la.
just do your best in maintaining the GPA. dont score below 1.5gpa

i tell u what u can do.

1) go UOL-SIM after you graduate from poly. this is your 2nd chance make sure u treasure it. 

2) make sure you do very well in UOL. score a second upper or first class honour.

3) go LBS in london to top up your degree with master.

guarantee u your future will be much brighter. even on par or better than NTU NUS undergrads.

dnkl01a,321_blastoff,"You want to get into banking, because it is expected of you, I completely understand. I also know how difficult it is for you to convince your parents otherwise. So now your only option is to die-die get a job in a bank. Let me tell you, it's not that impossible.  

Having worked in a bank for many years, I have seen so many kinds of people with various qualifications, ESPECIALLY in back office. Back office is nothing math of finance related, you just have to be hardworking and put in the hours - it's a lot of paperwork, really. Please don’t be too clever and apply for a BO job through the banks’ career portal, you’ll be fighting with local uni grads. Instead, go through a recruiter, ie. Recruit Express, etc etc (you know what I mean). They’ll start with putting you in a temp 6-month BO contract. Once you have that on your resume, it’s easier for your to get another contract job or hopefully a permanent job.

Now, let me address your attitude. I can sense a big “woe is me” tone from you. A lot of people in the world have to do things they don’t want to do. Your parents expect this out of you, deal with it. Please put in the effort and try to at least bump up your GPA in Year 3. You think school is hard? Try working. 

That being said, please don’t kill yourself, your parents will be very sad. Thanks. "

Nobody is going to look down on you because of your grades, if they do, they arent worth your time. figure out what you want, and go get it. all the best"
dnkm1gw,oncewereworriers,"Look at a compromise eg some human resources and finance /banking overlap and you need bank/finance background. Eg compensation and benefits, global mobility, superannuation. There is always shortage of analytical people in these areas field. Having a knowledge of the banking skills could help you gain employment in the banking industry on another discipline. Things like data visualisation, AR, and predicative analytics are areas that mathematical. Some Australia university's are also in Singapore with a good reputation and and have lower entry requirements and are well connected to banking industry. 

At the end of the day tho, it is almost impossible to motivate for other people's goals. Do what ever it is that you would work all night for, or work for free for.

dnknrne,limkopi,"Hi there. I went from an IT course to a sociology course in Uni. It sucked because I was like you trying to hold on. Try and recover your grades with a humanities course as a future goal, and talk to someone if all else fails. I believe many have shared contact numbers to reach out to help."
dnkqjqb,lockheed_2000,"Please don't take your own life just because of your poor grades. You are only 18, you still have your whole life ahead of you. You think it might end your suffering and despair, but in reality you're only transferring them to your parents and friends. 

Spend some time sitting down and thinking about what you REALLY want out of life. A degree? Happiness? A well-paying job? You said you liked humanities, but there wasn't any humanities-related course in poly, so you're in banking diploma now. It's okay. Explore your education options after your banking diploma, and come up with a plan. Don't listen to your parents advice, or whatever you hear from them and your friends. It's your life, why should they determine it?

From what I can infer, you're most probably afraid of being judged and looked down upon by other people. In life, you have to learn not to give a shit. Don't think too much of what people might or might not think about you, as you could use the time to further improve and better yourself.

Try to appreciate the small things in life. You are already quite lucky to be born in Singapore, to be in Poly studying, have ample food, water and a warm shelter. I am not trying to put you down or criticise you, but many more other people are experiencing worse in this world. What about those elderly who are still working odd jobs to support themselves, day-in and day-out? 

My current advice to you is, finish Poly. After poly, take a gap year or 2, and meanwhile search for new options to pursue your passion/goals, either overseas or locally. Craft a good plan, and swear by it. 

If you need anyone to talk to, you can call the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), or message me over Reddit. I am always willing to lend you an ear."
dnkr4m9,coldgear,"There's also the option of just finishing your diploma and switching industries ( be it humanities or sales or whatever you want ). 

At the end of the day, EXPERIENCE is worth three times more than some official piece of paper. For example, my parents - my dad has a diploma in electric eng. and my mom has an 'O' level cert. But through hardwork and determination they gave me a very comfy life - the diploma holder ironically never even worked in anything related to electric engineering!! He worked in sales for over 10 years now then switched to become a field application engineer ( for touchscreen company ) and is now earning maybe 7k+ per month minimum. He says it's mostly on the job training. 

Besides, if you do well in the work industry you will definitely shine and progress. 
For example if you worked this job for 5+ years maybe your employer may give you the opportunity to take up a degree and may even pay fully for your course. Of course, maybe you will lose out to your friends in terms or income but if you shine the peanut enough it will glitter.

TL;DR:

I hope you find a way to be happy.

 I wasn't cut out for my (initial) dream career but now I'm successful doing something else because I found out what I was good at and was passionate about it.  As the saying goes, if you're good at something and are super passionate about it, you will be happy and WILL be successful.

Did well for Os to qualify for any poly course, wanted to do Engineering with the view of studying Physics (my passion) in uni, but my authoritarian dad objected and forced me into accountancy for pragmatic reasons. I absolutely hated and had zero interest/talent in the business content. Tried to switch courses for a year till I exhausted all options and consequently fell into deep depression. 

It's been 2 years since my graduation, and 2 years of psych treatment, but my depression has only gotten worse. I think resigning myself to fate and giving up on life was what kept me alive through these years. Life was much more agonising back when I was still holding on to my dreams.

I graduated from NTU last year, been to so many interviews but still jobless as fuck, my point is, just because you think you have made it on one platform doesn't mean it's stable, tides change and so will circumstances. I thought being in NTU was at least a secure platform for my future, but guess not. The one thing you should keep in mind is be adaptable, if you're adaptable you can achieve anything, that's something we are not familiar with because we all crave for stability. There will always be a silver lining in every circumstances, and we won't see it till once everything has passed and we think in retrospect. Trust your intuition, that is one self aspect that will never fail you. "
dnl8eq0,idetectanerd,"im gonna give you some strength... just hold yourself accountable for what you are going to do in future. and with that, i do mean that CHOOSE what you want!

im a living example that i took engineering because some douche told me that it's good money and i should look at that path.

it's not that good compare to my peer of other field, what i'm good at is art and music, what i really like to do is accounting.

you are still young, the most you gonna graduate together with peers of the ITE student because you fail your poly this round, retake it and do what ever you like.

also, as someone who's been suicidal multiple times, i know how horrible it feels. but i can assure you, the moment you decide to seek help (as you have!) it will get better. although you have mentioned the helplines do not provide concrete advice, i believe that therapy might help. i'm not sure if polytechnics offer mental healthcare but you could possibly try visiting a counsellor or a therapist to help with the depressive thoughts.

Source: I did average in school and the people who didnt do as well as me  have better, stable jobs than me now, in just a few years after graduating. 

Life is ups and downs... You already did your best I'm sure. The rest is up to fate, and also about how you bounce back from the setbacks and move on.

There's so much joy in just living. You don't need good grades for that. I mean, we have the Internet and movies, comics, entertainment, porn, on tap. If we go out, a few dollars can get us a nice cheap meal to fill our stomachs. It's great to be alive. 

You are still young less than 25. You never know how life will turn out or throw you sweet surprises. 

You might be disappointed with yourself but don't worry too much, maybe go for a jog, exercise and clear your mind, then think about what's the next step, where do you want your life to go, then take a tiny step towards that.. 

There are jobs related to history. Some government related jobs like Home Affairs, state courts, mica, museums, schools, they hire arts, history, social science graduates, to work for them. Writing policies or other diverse work. It's not a dead end. Being good at history means you're able to read/decipher/analyse textually, understand social contexts, and form cohesive arguments. That's a skill that definitely will be needed in jobs.

Don't give up and don't be afraid to fail, everyone whom made it to the top has failed and has failed many times at some points, only difference between those on the top and those on the bottom is how many times those on the top stood up again, even if it meant to do 180 in their life and start from scratch"
dnlypbz,afraidofyall,"I don't quite remember how poly works anymore, can you move into marketing or something 'softer'? It's still in the 'Business' field, and marketing is close to social sciences. History is a broad field of study as well, so you'll need to think of what you want to learn.

Always remember that you are not limited by what you graduate by. I studied business tourism and now I'm in a job of a very different nature that I love, and it took me 2-3 jobs before I got to it. There are times I took a downgrade in pay, even now some friends think I'm earning lesser than 'deemed desireable'' in society. But I'm happy (and frugal) and I'm living well beyond my needs.

Do not despair. You'll never let down your parents, as long as you do yourself fair and honest. 

Don't cut out opportunities. Don't focus only on local Uni/institutions and don't forget that this is not your final step in learning. You will always have an opportunity to continue in lifelong learning. It may not be now that you can do History, but you will definitely have an opportunity to do so.

Be proactive and continue asking anyone you know in poly as well. Ask for alternatives, if you don't the right answer keep asking and be persistent. If they don't know the answer, ask if they know whom might have an answer and ask him/her!

Good luck!"

dnmnpea,GramTooNoob,"I'm 30 without a degree, so my options are certainly worse than yours. When I was young, I work part time to pay for my studies since I didn't had the support of my family when I go into IT. Things went well for me in the company, I was smart and respected so I thought job experience was more important than paper. Thus, I stopped after getting a diploma. But after leaving my job, I ended up in a weird situation. Everywhere a degree is needed, and this stupid requirement has made me feel like killing myself. It's not my fault that I cannot afford a degree. 

I'm not the smartest person but I'm not stupid either. I even won Singapore best startup but couldn't afford to go on the overseas mentorship opportunity. In the end, I failed my startup cause I had no money to expand too. Money always limit my options and money is not something I can simply go out and grab from a tree. Am I destine to fail just because I'm poor? And because I'm poor, I'm branded stupid? When I finally saved enough to go for my degree, my father had a stroke and I had to withdrew to pay for his medical needs. Is that my fault? Why am I so bad lucked?

Long story short, you aren't the only one who made bad choices but I'm still here and much older than you. It's nothing wrong to want to feel like killing yourself. We all have expectations, (be it our own or other's) and we try to live up to those. Virtual reality has also taught us that when things goes wrong, just reset. Windows crash? Just restart. Virus? Just reinstall. Real life interestingly works the same. But restarting or reinstalling is just a workaround method, its not going to help me when the same problem pop up again. So what I'm going to do instead, is make the best out of my time here, learn as much as I can from my mistakes and try not to do the same in my next life. I know I don't offer the best advice, but its still something and I hope it helps you.

P.S: People are more concern about their broken fingernail or messed hairstyle than your problem =) Don't feel you have reached the last mile just because the helpline didn't work, they just wanna end their shift and go home early like everyone else.

Poly doesn't offer a lot of humanities courses, so changing course could be of little help to you.

Then you have 2 options, depending on how much confidence you have in your humanities subjects and keeping :

1. Take private A levels in 2018 (sorry, 2017 exams already started). You'll finish around the same time as your current poly classmates, so not a lot of time wasted, and if you're confident enough in your own ability to cope you can even save your parents the school fees.
2. Register for JAE in January 2018, get into a JC, and spend two years there, taking your As in 2019. It'll be a year late, but better than than never, especially if you think you're more suited to the structured nature of JC. But this would probably only work if you have good O-level results (which you probably have, if you got into banking)

From there, you can work your butt off to get into NUS or NTU. This is, of course, working on the assumption that the end goal of your parents is for you is to get into a local uni, so you should do your best for As whichever route you take. And once in uni, you can try to work towards getting into academia and see if you can prove your parents wrong - they have a Masters? You have a PhD, how's that?

I know it sounds harsh but sometimes you have to be selfish for you own sanity. Don't be that person who wakes up one morning in their 40s and realised they've wasted their entire life just to please others.   
If finance is not your thing, don't do it. Pushing yourself is not going to work if you have no interest. I know that quite well as a teacher.   
I've had a really rough teen years with my parents but it all went well. I was really rebellious and skipped school all the time. I only did this because I hated my course and I didn't know how to tell them. My parents didn't believe I was interested in a course only available in a private school. I dropped out of ITE, worked 3 jobs for 6months and made a deal with my mother to pay half of the school fees. I'm in the industry now and can finally prove to her that I made it and am really interested in my field.    
In your case, I understand getting to uni is pretty much impossible. Drop out. Stop wasting time. Find out if there are any private schools offering your course or if you can take the exams as a private student and study on your own. I think NIE might have something.    
My parents still hate me for the things I did when I was in a school but everything turned out well now and we have a great relationship. I wish that I had talked to her instead of being rebellious and a terrible daughter. Things will turn out well for you too as long as you follow your passion. Don't be afraid to do drastic things. I know it'll seem like a safer and more comfortable bet to stay in poly and just go with the flow. But you know you're screwed. Wake up and get out. Don't go the flow if you don't belong.

dnkljjc,potofplants,"I know what you mean about arguments and critical thinking etc, I took Core History in sec sch and I aced in it. What I meant to say was, I have wide knowledge in those events. 

I'll take those into consideration thank you :-)  "
dnklkz3,luacs1998,"> uni level history isn't as much about recitation as it is about critical thinking, examination and argumentation, really, but a wide-ranging knowledge will put you ahead of most of your peers.

This is an honest question, though it may not help - would business studies also require such critical thinking abilities, and is OP's poor grades because she cannot grasp the concepts taught in business, in which case switching courses may also not work out? I know SP's Banking course has Economics and Business Law (the latter being a third year module), so it might be somewhat related.

This might sound a bit self serving, but even if I too am able to recite off the reasons for the fall of the German Empire and the 9001 different ways that Trump is literally the 21st century Kaiser Wilhelm, up against real history/political science grads, I know I'd be toast since I never really did well in humanities even in school.

EDIT: Saw OP's reply - if she has what it takes, then I guess getting out might still be a better choice."

dnmap55,cobwknight,"Retail service industry, right. When did you graduate from university? (Or did you even attend one) 10 years ago? 

And why are you associating history with doing art related field? We history majors don't draw. 

I have not seen any of my graduated seniors working full time in any of the retail shops. Some of my seniors went up to take government positions granting them decent salaries, one even went on to work in Google. 

It's the 21st century, things have changed. If you don't know anyone who has this degree and what they went on to do (which I doubt you do), then avoid commenting on it. You can use your own belief and prejudices to judge others who do what they like, then perhaps take a look at yourself. Maybe you'll realise you are just one of the fellas that didn't have the courage to pursue your own passion many years ago.

> A 25-year-old Chinese national ended his life after he was sacked from his job as a cook here. Faced with daunting prospects and feeling cheated by a middleman who helped him find work in Singapore, Su Zhong Qing leapt off the 10th floor if the apartment block he was living in on Monday (!6 Oct).

> He did not survive the suicide attempt.

> Su’s mother, 59-year-old Mdm Li Hua, collected his body this past Saturday (28 Oct). She recounted to the Chinese daily that she had a video-call with him just moments before he ended his life, when he told her that he had been cheated in the process of finding work in Singapore:

> Su had arrived in Singapore in July this year and began working as a cook at a Marina Square restaurant.

> He was abruptly fired from his job early last month, after he failed a cooking exam.

> Laden with debt due to the costs of finding a job in Singapore, Su became depressed that he would not be able to pay off his financial obligations now that he had lost his job.

> Still, Mdm Li did not expect her son to take his own life. She added:

> Mdm Li further elaborated that the funeral parlour kindly gave her family a large discount.

> Responding to allegations that he had made off with the $1000 condolence money from the restaurant, Su’s middleman explained to the Chinese daily that he used the money to pay for the funeral costs and that he did not bother contacting Su’s family because he thought they had already made their own plans:

> The middleman alleged that he had met Su two days prior to the fatal leap and had assuaged him that he would find another job for him. He added that he did not expect Su to day that he wanted to return home the next day, or that Su would commit suicide.

> Su has been cremated in Singapore. His ashes will be sent back to his hometown in China.

d05h4vk,xavierkoh,"Absolutely heartbreaking, I can relate as I was a blur kid in army, its not smth that can be changed easily. I can relate to his troubles adapting, I got emotional and confused when I enlisted, cried in my room sometimes, having low self-esteem and slight depression from loneliness while trying to adapt to an unforgiving environment, sergeants n section mates calling me blur and all, but luckily I snapped out of it. It must have been turmoil for him deep inside with his family problems as well. Even though society has this perceived notion that ""if you cant even cope with BMT you are weak"", some people carry along a real emotional and psychological baggage inside them that intensify in this kind of high-stress/authoritative environment, causing them to snap and even suicide... this is something that the army should actively check for and provide active sources of help for enlistees even before/when they enlist, e.g. sergeants offering to chat with enlistees during admin time for any issues instead of an one-off formal event... because some people will not speak up for themselves until prompted to. Just my thoughts though. RIP"

d05ji28,KeythKatz,"The problem is that the training culture is so different from actual unit and went culture. Where BMT and all the different wings' basic trainings are hell and showcase the worst part of Army life and all its inefficiencies and wayangs, many units are the complete opposite and you'd think it was just normal, sane corporate culture imported into the unit."
d05mu0y,AmazingRW,"It's unfortunate, but I do not think it that the blame should be totally on the training institute. People react differently to NS, and a minority are unable to tolerate the training/work even though they might be reasonable. There is a certain degree of challenge in identifying such individuals, the ideal scenario would be that they undergo medical review and be given unfit-to-serve status.

Back when I was in NS as an officer, there was this general storeman who went AWOL for more than half a year with all sorts of reasons. I had to search for him. His store had almost no work, and the other storemen were just sitting around most days listening to music in the store. The point is, it was definitely not the work/training volume that is unreasonable, some individuals just could not adapt to NS. "

some people dont take instructions very well, especially if it is shouted at them, etc. depressed or unsound mind. there should be proper mental screening done throughout the entire process, even pre-NS.

I was referred to a hospital only to be given painkillers as the doctors there have the same attitude toward NSFs as MOs. After a prolonged period of 7 months I gave up and went to a private specialist. Did a quick scan to confirm that I was indeed suffering from a genuine back condition. Went back to camp to show them the report and my CSM had the cheek to ask me ""How the fuck did that happen?"""

d05lpyz,xavierkoh,"Woah thats really disgusting... I agree that bad MOs are part of the problem as well, they want to be cynical to people who report sick but if the person really has depression, it will make them feel even worse about themselves and not seek help anymore. I'm glad you took action and helped your friend :)"
d06j1xj,helzinki,What kind of doctor is that?!?! What the fuck.
d05m5a4,xavierkoh,"You are right, it is difficult to encourage this behaviour in such an environment. 


For the sergeants, while they have to enforce discipline and be strict, they can remind/inform their platoon consistently in the first few weeks on the avenues that recruits could seek help, be it through walking in anytime during admin time in their offices to chat about legitmate issues they face, or calling the counsellor hotline/sms service. They can also promote a helpful culture by reminding the platoon to help people who are more blur and people behave strangely/seem unable to adapt. Sergeants should not overshame anyone who often does badly/mark anyone and warn recruits who do so will be punished, but of course they should still be strict and enforce discipline. Furthermore, to inform that any recruit can take the initiative to raise it up to the superiors of anyone needing help as well.


In terms of counselling, a private box could be set up for recruits to write their problems and the counsellor will contact them, or even allow for SMSing a number anoymously. People who face depression would be unlikely to call the counsellor hotline themselves, and sometimes they do not want to talk to the superiors who are strict/fierce. Finally, sergeants interviewing each recruit could ask more relevant questions about the personal life of the recruit, giving reassurance to the person as well that it will be kept confidental and they are always available to help, instead of doing it like a routine job (for me, I did not feel inclined to tell the sergeant my problems because it felt like he was doing for the sake of doing it and did not feel confident enough to tell him my problems). Finally as the other user added, MO should stop behaving like douchebags and be more professional in helping people with depression.


Just my 2 cents on this issue, perhaps not all of these can be enforced and typing this in a hurry so yeah"
d05m6pf,xavierkoh,"I know, but they are allowed to talk to the recruits about the problems they are facing out of training time and they have special allocated times for them to have 1-1 sessions. Its just that it often feels like the sergeants do it for the sake of doing it and do not feel reassuring enough for people to confide in them"
d05ooop,AmazingRW,"Huh? Please do not put words into others' mouths.

My point is clear, it's that the training/work are generally reasonable and that the fault lies in the system that is responsible for detecting individuals who are unfit to serve...which itself is a challenging task."

d05p1pf,Pinkpotatopew,Yes. Welcome to bmt.
d05k0ik,mamypokopants,"This happened during one of our ICT, one of my platoon mates was genuinely sick during outfield and had to report to MO, the MO said he was trying to keng amongst other nasty things, and my PC when he found out was damn unhappy and went up to the CO to complain about the standard of the MO during that ICT. 

Not sure exactly what happened after though but my PC was pretty damn pissed off because of this incident, and he is actually those very siao on type during ICTs (everything by the book)"
d05jrgk,mwolfee,Agree completely. That's not just out of line for a doctor - it's unethical of him to say that.
d05njyu,help-me-understand,"Unfortunately, we are limited to doing that. Even our superior may not be able to do much should the people in charge of the camp choose not to pursue the matter. "

As I recalled, I have had very little trouble with the MO (except for an unusually long wait time and yes, a slightly combative MO who could not do anything because I had not one, but TWO letters from CGH, one of which is directly attributable to BMT)."

Got a friend who vomited many times after lunch in camp one day and he decided to walk about two kilometres to the nearest medical centre only to be greeted with *""You're supposed to report sick in the morning!""* even when he had explained that he only started vomiting *after lunch*.

Later he was hospitalised for gastric infection.

cdm0g1z,junnies,"The PAP is very similar to American Republicans on economic issues.

Income inequalities due to capitalism are not properly corrected due to the excuse of ""work ethic, self-reliance, no hands-out"" blahblahblah, all of which only make sense when you ignore context

What is the context? That the cost of living in Singapore IS high when medical costs are involved (if you are relatively healthy the cost of living is still manageable), that many forms of economic labor (mainly unskilled labor, but also some forms of skilled labor) pay insufficiently, and the social safety net is unreliable

Of course, the government will ramble on about ""upgrading skills"", although common sense will tell you that a portion of our population will ONLY be able to do unskilled labor due to various deficiencies (mainly intelligence but perhaps also temperament, life circumstances, personality, age, etcetra). Politically Correct people will never mention this (and neither do most bloggers and academics) although it is such an obvious phenomenon.

What is the solution? I'm not in favor of a welfare state but i think its common sense to redistribute massive wealth inequalities. This would indefinitely result in lower cash flows and a decline in economic activity since Singapore would be ""less competitive"". 

Here lies the crux; do we want ""economic competitiveness"" or a more compassionate, commonsensical society ie Do we want more millionaires, or do we want a fairer, more egalitarian country? Since higher taxes = more redistribution but also = less economic activity = less millionaires

(The two are not necessarily exclusive, but in the context of Singapore and the way in which the government frames the issue and dictates economic policy, it is. Extraordinary government can accomplish both at the same time, but the present PAP leadership is quite mediocre (and this should be obvious to everyone via observing indicators such as decreasing quality of life, increasing unhappiness, election results))"

Made a rant a few months ago. NSF don't get respect for Singapore because they are seen as forced government personnel, not real soldiers. It stems from the idea that a soldier is someone who actively protects a country from an ongoing threat.

South Korea conscripts are respected because they risk their lives against the ongoing threat of North Korea. Same with Taiwan with China and Israel with Hamas. People know they are protected through the sacrifice of these conscripts.

Singapore, on the other hand, is one of the only country with a peace-time full time conscription system, design to protect us against......who? Because we have people forced into government service to play soldier full time with no tangible enemy, they are seen more as ""paying their tax"" in the form of their time rather than actual soldiers.

Goddammit it's not an Indian thing, it's a hotgarbagecomics thing!

A friend of mine has a similar problem: she's great at her job, and her managers have complimented her because of her ""German efficiency"" and constantly alluding to her German-ness as the key to her success, and not that she's awesome as a person.

dmjeiip,cowbungaa,"I followed the case closely when the news first broke. It was a relatively straightforward case of suicide, but the grieving family blew up the matter into a full-fledged tinfoil hat conspiracy. IMO, the family refused to accept the possibility that their son had committed suicide because it was against their religious beliefs (his Mum is a pastor).

Most of the family's ""evidence"" of foul play was refuted during the coroner's inquiry by independent, US-based experts. For example, the family consulted their own ""expert"" who claimed that Shane had wounds consistent with him being strangled to death. However, [2 US chief medical examiners refuted these claims](http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1243390/us-experts-reject-murder-theory-shane-todds-death-singapore), and agreed with the Singapore pathologists' findings that Shane had committed suicide. When testifying during the inquiry, the Todds' expert witness [withdrew his claims](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shane-todd-inquiry-parents-us-based-expert-recants-finding-that-dr-todd-was-strangled) that Shane had injuries caused by strangulation. The Todds' expert witness also admitted that he was not a certified forensic pathologist and did not receive formal training in the subject.

The family also got their own ""computer expert"" who claimed that someone looked at Shane's external hard drive after he died (presumably the ""assassin"" who killed him to steal secrets). However, it turns out that this was simply the police who were looking through the deceased's belongings. This was further [corroborated by the FBI](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shane-todd-inquiry-fbi-backs-evidence-that-police-had-recovered-and-examined-hard-drive)."
dmjf07u,AmazingRW,"As many have pointed out in the past, both the FBI and US medical experts have corroborated the findings of the Singapore authorities - That the case was a suicide.

As for the plans for travel that you brought up, I would not totally dismiss them, but it is also not quite right to assume that one who has suicidal thoughts would act logically. The act of suicide itself is not logical, for it might be driven by impulsive thoughts."
dmjju4y,dravidan7,"suppose all cases have some amt of contradicting evidence. 

but the parents and girlfriend of the deceased said he was mentally affected by the work. which involved high level tech. 

and while i can't say much about assassins. there are tons of spies employed by MNCs and high tech firms to steal rival's technologies or patents etc. but it isn't james bond level stuff. far more mundane. and hardly spoken outside the industry.

but more to the case. the deceased was found to have left a note praising his employers and company which his gf found surprising cos he hated his job. 
 
and spf itself kinda cockup the investigation a bit. kinda feeds into parents view that there is a coverup. cos they never dust the scene for fingerprints to see if another person or assassin was in the scene. and they accessed his computer right there using password they got off a piece of paper instead of bringing back to their tech lab. 

then when found out in court justified their actions by saying official guidelines can be deviated from.

i mean if you were the grieving parents who thought their son won't commit suicide.....these things sure feels like cover up mah.

cii61i3,Hope83,"I think I will try to give a more elaborate response.

Suicide hotlines such as SOS requires the suicidal individual in question to call them. They will not call the person themselves. 

As you are not close to her nor know her well I presume, the most straightforward idea is to inform her parents directly. This isn't the best solution but it is the ""safest"" option tentatively.

There will be people who advocate speaking to her first. Ideally if you are capable of reaching out to her, knowing what to say and knowing what not to say, this is indeed the best approach in preventing her from ending her life if she was indeed contemplating such. However, the reverse can also happen if you say the wrong things or approach this in a manner where she feels uncomfortable. 

My view is, first assume the worst as in she's thinking of suicide and treat it as a very serious situation. However, in your words with either her or the parents, do not jump to conclusions that she is thinking of such but rather gently approach it in a ""you are concerned about what might be happening"" stance. 

If you speak to her parents, the responsibility will then lie on her parents to address the issue with her. If her parents don't handle it well, she will panic and feel worse but then this leaves you off the hook since the responsibility is no longer yours in a way thus the safest option for you. Someone on suicidewatch mentioned this as well. 

"
cii4ufx,mixmutch,"I think it's best to tell her father what you saw happened. Say you're concerned for her safety. If you can, monitor the situation for a few more days. Remove your table from the corridor/walkway. If similar events happen again and again, then it's a pattern that something is wrong. Then get the police involved by going to the nearest police station. If this is only a one time event, it's probably no big deal, but best to keep an eye on it."
ciiay94,,"If I were in your position I'd see how their parents personality would be like, If the father would be grumpy type I would avoid talking to him about it. If the mom is all good, just let her know about it and tell her to keep it low or something..

Please remove any chairs, tables or anything that can be used to climb over the ledge from your corridor. Although it might not seem like much, having an obstacle before suicide might delay or stop a person from committing suicide.

Btw take care because she is hurt and probably, letting her speak about what's going bad doesn't work best..try to ask her about beautiful things such as her friends or whatever, even talking about your experiences is good, focus on POSITIVE THOUGHTS...i assume that she has problems in her family as she was standing outside her house. 
Maybe leave her a message on a paper, to the same place where you think she would do it, and write in something nice, like inviting her to come to you and have a coffe, write her that this world is fucked up like it is, and that is normal to be hurt...maybe can let her understand that someone care of her!

In other news, a family friend survived a 13 floor drop (attempted suicide) with some damage to the bones in the leg and a bit of vertebrae stuff (slipped disc, etc). That was almost a decade ago; she got married and gave birth to her first child recently.

cii6oqu,Hope83,"It's quite rare for people to be suicidal due to conflict with their parents unless it's an extremely dysfunctional family (eg. abusive family) . However, the fact remains, which we both agree on, is that the reactions of her parents, regardless of the reason, can push her away even more leading to a subsequent attempt as most people lack the skills and know-how of how to help or reach out to someone who's suicidal. 

If you attempt to reach out to her on your own, and she doesn't respond to you, then you will still likely be forced to inform her parents regardless. "
cii5oqi,mixmutch,"Don't talk to her parents about suicide. It's still a speculation at this point. Best if you can hear her out first about what she has to say, and tell her that you have to tell her parents(if it's serious). Everyone wants to be heard. If she agrees to let you talk to her parents, tell them about what you witnessed (and what she told you) , and that you're concerned.  "
cij51r9,NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,I'm not sure; I was too young to know the details then
ciiaat9,anu26,"Was in therapy for depression/suicidal tendencies for a while - can confirm absolutely that abusive family can cause people to become suicidal. I do think I agree with the OP that that is a concern however, and that approaching the parents may not initially yield any result because they are the root cause of her attempt. TBH as someone who has been on the other side it's really difficult to say what one should do. I would have appreciated any form of help that anyone wanted to give me when I was suicidal, instead my mum egged me on after my first attempt. If anyone then would have reached out, I would have grabbed the opportunity with both hands, so I do agree with you in that an attempt to reach out to the girl herself would be ideal.

When I was in pri 4 I did what this boy did, tried to end it all by jumping. Only I didn't die, suffered a fractured ankled and some internal bleeding. I was lucky my house was located on the third floor. 

In the hospital I was questioned by the police, I didn't dare to tell them I jumped, so I just said I fell and didn't remember what happened. I was a coward.

After the incident my parents seemed to understand and stopped the caning practice. I was still nagged on daily, though I had a lot more free time for myself. I didn't do as well as expected for my psle(247), didn't get to special stream but I feel that it was a lot better for my sanity. It saddens me to see a parent in mourning but don't even see the error in their ways."
d92upbl,doctorwhybother98,"> ""She heard her lamenting in Mandarin, saying 'I only asked for 70 marks, I don't expect you to get 80 marks,'"" Insp Ong added.

I'm going to say it: Some people really don't deserve to be parents. This mother is one of those people. I know next to nothing about them personally, but what I've read is enough to conclude that the boy's grades were just the tip of the iceberg in the list of reasons that drove him to suicide. The bulk of the iceberg is most probably parental abuse and neglect. 

A friend of mine thinks that the boy's suicide was his own fault. He thinks the boy was just weak-willed and chose to escape from his problems instead of dealing with it. I've tried to convince him that this might not be so, and that it takes more than being simply weak-willed to drive a person to suicide, but he's adamant on not changing his view. 

Also in case anyone is interested, here's a quote by DFW on the nature of suicide and depression:

> “The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” "
d92yrve,,"No sympathy for the boy's parents. The boy is only 11 years old, what does he know about coping? Especially with parents like that. So many stories of young children committing suicide because of exam results, not because they personally feel like they could have done better but because they are afraid to face the wrath of their parents. Dying is better than their mother/father caning them for not getting *insert number* marks or a certain grade.

It is just primary 5. Sure, the PSLE scores will show what stream you can enter and which school you can go to. But parents need to stop being so fucking delusional. No, your child is not going to  be the next president. Stop expecting him to get into RI or another elite school.

Parents like them are so fucking disgusting. And where do we hear news like this? Singapore. Everything must be about grades, marks, good schools. All this bullshit implanted into our brains, ingrained in our society since young. This has to stop. What are they doing to our future generations? No wonder birth rate so low.  Your child might end up dead before he even turn 12! 

Please, anyone reading this or who have read the article, if you think grades are everything and getting into a good school is #1 priority, don't ever reproduce. All parents want the best for their child, yes, but if you can carry a human being for 9 months and raise him for 11 years, then treat him like that because of numbers on a paper, you are not fit to be a parent.

And Singaporean men, if your wife is acting that way to the fruit of your loins, why would you continue letting her treat your child like that? Stand up for your kids, man. Don't be a coward and just give in to your wife, let her do whatever she wants. That kid is your responsibility too. You helped make that child. If you're going to be a pussy, might as well you kill yourself too, so you don't have to deal with the heartbreak of losing your child and the regret of not saying/doing something to prevent your child from committing suicide.

Truly disgusting. Shame on his parents. I truly hope they live in guilt for the rest of their lives. Now they see for themselves how important those marks are without their son. "
d92vjml,telehax,Um did the coroner base this on any medical evidence? If i'm reading this correctly it was determined to be suicide entirely via the investigation and interviews.

d934yp1,Tusjecht,"I think it goes more than that. As the older sibling in the family, not only do I feel incredibly saddened by this young boy's decision, I feel even worse that:

1) his sister has probably faced the same kind of neglect and abuse that /u/doctorwhybother98 guesses they've experienced, 

2) She's probably in some position of authority as her older sibling to be able to do or notice something, but now that her brother has chosen to jump she will live from this day with a guilt of not doing more to intervene,

3) As the stress from 'O' levels piles up, she *will* need support. She will need some consolation from both her brother's death and her mother's callous attitude. And if her father is going to live in denial and believe his son fell to his death, that's a house she's not going to find a home in. 

Suicide isn't the first option for children. They deal with stress in many ways - spending more time with friends, staying away from home, looking for someone or someplace where they feel safe and belonged. If the boy's sister cannot find a support, fast, she will break down sooner or later and I imagine she may not rule out her brother's choice. Thankfully, with attention on their family I am hoping that she gets help - else, here is a shoutout to her:

This is a fucking 11 year old kid for god's sake. If millions of adults can't cope with stress too well, why do you think an 11 year old kid being neglected by his parents can? It's human nature to want to not have to deal with our problems, and this 11 year old saw it fitting to not want to deal with a life of abuse.

I'm not saying she deserves any punishments but sometimes the death of a child may not be enough for them to learn their lesson. 

Sure enough, it is a severe punishment for the parent to have to go through their child's death accidental or otherwise. 

However, did they indeed learn from the incident?

Did they actually understand why their child decided to take this route?"

I think that's a very enlightening comparison, because the difference is in the value system that produced certain, shall we say, results?

So it's not really the hardship per se (getting good grades vs starving), but more of the values applied to the hardship and the ""penalties"" faced. "

e03ybpq,plumpig,"Remember that recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be many days where it seems as though everything you're trying is just a stopgap measure, and that because your default is unhapiness, you revert to it the moment whatever momentary pleasure you managed to claw for yourself fades. 

Keep plugging at it, though! 

If you've been prescribed meds, take them. If money isn't too much of an issue, search for a therapist until you find one you like. Be gentle with yourself, surround yourself with as much positivity as you can, and occasionally give yourself a reward for trying hard. Give it enough time and you'll develop enough perspective to realize that you're actually making progress. 

What I did to claw my way out of depression was to spend a ton of time volunteering with the needy. Keeping busy and focusing on other people's problems took my mind off my own. It took a really long time, though. 

As for the bullies, I'm sorry you had such a hard time. When people are cruel to you, it's a reflection of who they are and not of you. Happy, well-adjusted people usually won't try destroying someone else's life. "
e03nwna,coolstuffbro,"Hi OP, 

I'm sorry that this is happening to you and I can't begin to understand how you are feeling. 

If you're looking for counsellors, I can recommend Silver Ribbon. They are an NGO that offers free counselling. Just google Silver Ribbon Singapore and you should be able to access their website easily. 

Also, if you are struggling with suicide ideation or thoughts about suicide, please call the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, 1800-221 4444. It's a 24/7 hotline and you can choose to remain anonymous. 

I hope this has been somewhat helpful. If you need more information or alternate recommendations for counsellors/therapists, please feel free to dm me! "
e04ghq6,normificator,"You are looking for a solution with an immediate tangible effect. There is no such solution except benzodiazepines. Even the SSRIs take some time to have effect. 

Since you know what caused your depression, my view is that doing the opposite will alleviate it. 

Schedule a time to join a group activity which you have some interest in and attend it faithfully whether you feel like it or not. 

That is a form of medication because the act of going out and talking to people effects changes in your brain chemistry. You take your medication whether you feel like it or not right? That’s the same for these activities. 

Same goes for your exercises. Have a routine. Of course don’t over do it. Moderate intensity but regular routine is key. The endorphins and the natural sunlight that comes with the outdoors is a form of medication. It modulates your dopamine and serotonin levels respectively. 

Control your stress levels, don’t take on too much responsibilities. 

Your sleep might be affected. Still, schedule a fixed time to go to bed. And sleep early like 9pm. 

You won’t see changes immediately. There’s no panacea. Just small changes you can make in your life to tilt the brain chemistry back to normality. Check back with yourself in 6 months. Keep a journal to see your progress. "
e04hmph,Zedwye,"I'm sorry that you're struggling, but never forget that you're not alone in this. Plenty of people have been through depression and still going through,including me. I got bullied myself in my primary school days and it still haunts me until now (I'm turning 30 this year). I sought for help at IMH and manage to connect with my therapist, and had sessions with her for a year and a half now, and I admit I got lucky because many people had to switch therapists to find one that they can connect with. Here's some personal opinions on how to manage depression a little better, I don't know if it's helpful or not,but my intention is to help you understand better.

1) Unfortunately, depression won't go away. But you can manage depression better by understanding yourself. Be mindful about the thoughts that come to your mind, and analyse them why they're hurting you, and see if you can find a solution for it. It's like problem solving, problems will always come, but you got to keep solving them, and in return,you learn more how to prevent these problems from starting in the first place. For instance, I always had this low self-esteem,self-bullying behaviour. After looking through my thoughts, I know it's from my past experience of being bullied that my bully had left his impression in my mind, because I know I've been neglecting my own self for many years. 

2) Your happiness cannot be compromised. It doesn't matter what others say, not even what I've written here, but if you can find your own happiness, then never let go of it. I can tell you a whole load of stuff to do, but you have to look and think if it's helpful for you, that it'll bring some joy and happiness back into your life.  Personally, I think you're trying really damn hard at seeking help, i.e. seeing therapists/counselors, taking meds, exercise etc, and these are steps that helps, even if they only bring brief moments of comfort to your life. 

3) Also, everyone reacts differently to pain. Just because it doesn't seem painful to others doesn't mean it's not painful to you. Do remember that there's light at the tunnel, but my opinion is that without the darkness ,there's no directionality to go to. (Darkness represents pain,sorrow,negativity while Light represents positivity and happiness) With this in mind, I understood better why I had to go though all my painful experience to reach this point of my life,and it's because without the pain, I have no sense of direction to head to to get better. I find that there's a purpose in suffering, even if those in pain can't see it. 

I hope this helps, and don't worry if you disagree with any of the stuff you said,and anyone can feel free to reply if they feel confused or anything :)"
e04ox9k,chanelwithflannel,"Hi OP, first off I’m really sorry to hear about your terrible experiences with mental healthcare providers. Also glad to hear that you are taking meds and will second other posters who mentioned that it takes a while to kick in. It might be hard to stay compliant to the medication due to the side effects but i hope you will continue to do so! 

I also second Silver Ribbon for that free counselling, not sure if you’re looking to get more regular healthcare but I can recommend Singapore Association for Mental Health, their Insight Centre provides counselling for mental health issues. Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) does mental health consultations for youths, and they have a physical space at SCAPE for you to speak to youth peer support workers if you need it. 

SACS is one I would highly recommend but more if you want rehab services, they have day rehab or residential rehab, and they provide counselling as well. They’ve got quite a few branches around Singapore so you can choose one that’s convenient for your living location

Should you need it, here are a list of hotlines you can call:
 
IMH: 63892222 (24h)
SOS: 1800-221-4444 (24h)
SAMH: 1800-283-7019
CHAT (more for youths but I’m assuming you’re one since you’re on reddit): 64936500/6501 and they have an online chat as well.

If you want info on other services feel free to DM me!! otherwise I really hope that despite your bad experiences you continue to strive on and i hope you will give these other services a chance too, i believe that they are good services who truly have a heart to help. Hang in there OP and I’m sending you lots of love and encouragement :)))"

Anyway as for self\-help methods, I typically write things out in the form of poetry/exposition and if it gets really really bad I text a friend and ask them to keep me company/rationalize thoughts for me. Otherwise I pretty much just ignore the episode and promise myself that it'll pass with time and I force myself to go on a run or something \(this happens to be the case most of the time during the semester\). On the days where getting off my bed to go for a run feels like a herculean task, I pretty much just drop to the floor and do a bunch of push\-ups. Or play video games. I recently just splurged on the PC version of Ni No Kuni II, but I guess I can only afford to do this since it's summer now.

e04mjnv,alive_note,"First off, I'm so sorry that your previous experiences were all so terrible and I can't say that I know how you feel but I have had similar experiences with bad therapists as well.

I'm assuming that you've done a lot of research on where to find good therapists so I'll just leave it at that.

But for self-help methods, I would first recommend that you start off slowly. For me, I started doing small tasks like cleaning, decorating and repainting my room to my liking. Small tasks set you up for medium tasks, and slowly you can move on to a new life. I cannot stress how important it is to surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are and people that are positive and comfortable to be with. Throw away any ""toxic"" relationships you may have and hopefully, you can slowly see a change from within.

I hope what I've said was somewhat helpful and if you need more information you can always drop me a DM, I'll be more than happy to help"")

PS: Just one of the thing I did when I was down was to exercise. I always felt much better after a work-out and getting a toner body definitely helped me with my self-confidence. Help is always there if you're willing to open yourself once more and I pray that you'll find the right therapist soon!"
e04px6a,daniel_twl,"I myself, as well as many others are currently suffering the exact same situation. I don’t have the answers but all I can say is that you are not alone. Laughable for Singapore to be declared best country for kids to grow up in. Sigh."
e04qsi0,jyee1050,Suffering from the same thing. Singapore in itself feels so suffocating to me. 
e04s7rp,,"OP, man u feel like me. I can totally relate to you. I have seen several counsellors and psychiatrists as well. One thing I try to do is set little goals, and set short goals, such as passing ABRSM exam, and little stuff to look forward to such as events like tsundere café. Take things one day at a time. "
e054w7f,donkydanq,"Speaking as somebody had severe depression growing up, the best a simplest long term solution to it is finding an exercise activity that you can do regularly. I wont lie, it will suck at first as you force yourself to do it but will help more than any anti-depressants will. Rather than trying running as you mentioned (which is super boring tbh) try something more social or something that has a long term goal with clear progress. Badminton, a martial art etc.

Here's a short talk on the subject that goes into the details of why it works, it's worth a watch

e04uxxo,rollin340,"All the best to you man.

If you do eventually find something that helps you, please do share for the others out there who are in your shoes too."
e050kv8,ForbiddenSabre,"Not sure whether what I’m suffering from is the same as yours but I constantly have the feeling of wanting to just run away from reality and escape from it (though not to the point of wanting to die but more of not wanting to have anything to do with whatever shitstorm that’s called my life, so maybe mild depression?). 
Well as for how I sort of cope with it is through music/anime as both let me escape from reality somewhat. Through playing musical instruments(self taught myself piano and guitar so you don’t really need a teacher if you’re worried about that stuff), I feel like I’m in my own world where I’m in control of everything, while through anime, the story telling and such helps me think in the shoes of the protagonist and forget whatever’s happening irl. 
Again I’m not sure whether I can completely relate with you on what’s going on in your life and hope you can recover from it but this is just my 2 cents on how I’m coping with the (sort of) similar symptoms which maybe can help you in sorting out yours :))"
e04vn7h,porowhale,"Hey, i'm so sorry that you have to go through all of that, and it must be really tough for you right now. Last year, I went to CHAT to get a free mental health assessment, was referred to IMH, but it didn't work out so I emailed CHAT again and they referred me to a different organisation. I have been receiving counselling from TOUCH ($20 per session) for 6 months now. You can try using CHAT to get referrals and find a counselor since it's free and they really do help you. 

My first counselor was the school counselor and it was clear that he didn't really care about long term help. My current one from TOUCH, is extremely helpful. We go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and it has helped me a lot. It takes some time and effort to find a therapist that clicks with you and it's entirely normal to change your therapist a couple of times. But once you can find someone that clicks and understands you, it truly becomes the beginning of your recovery. 

Honestly, it's not easy. It's so hard even right now. When I first started my counselling sessions, I was still extremely suicidal and it lasted for 3+ months. It's too complicated for me to even write it out but my emotions and self hate was intense and it was a week of happiness, and a week of turmoil. Sometimes, i'd crawl into my wardrobe, curl up into a ball, close the doors and cry. Even now, a small part of me still believes that I am not deserving of happiness, and I still think of self harm and punishment.

 I would say that who I am right now is made up of 30% counselling, 40% Practicing the CBT methods on my own, 10% Self-Help books and research, 20% changing my lifestyle. 

With mental health, people can't actually help you or change your life for you. They can't wave a magic wand or feed you high doses of pills for the rest of your life to permanently cure you of your illness. All they can do is provide advice, support you and arm you with the techniques needed to deal with your depression.

When I first started, we focused on the negative thoughts and learnt how to combat it, there was a lot of meditation involved too. As we progress, I started reading educational books on the side about depression on my own(""Bipolar, not much"" is a really good book because of how much I was able to resonate, and the information provided helped me so much. Borrow it from the library). With counselors, communication is really important too. I read ""The bell jar"" and even though it did trigger me, it helped me shape my emotions to words so that I can express them better. Then, I started doing small changes to my life. I shifted my bed closer to the window to get more sunlight, I took walks at night, I started doing c25k which is a program that starts off jogging from 1minute intervals, to 30mins which would eventually help you run 5k. 

Started volunteering at an animal shelter to gain confidence when talking to people, I kept a private thought journal which I used to pen down how I feel, so that I can discuss with my counselor during the next session. I went from 1 session a week, to every 2 weeks. Tomorrow, i'll be meeting my counselor and it would be a three week gap from my previous session. I changed my social circle, got involved in a reddit discord group which focused on a healthy lifestyle and losing weight.

 Mind you, all of this happened within 6months. I took it slow. I wasn't happy all the time, it was never a single light switch, there wasn't a fire that suddenly started burning inside of me. Nope, it took so much time. My moods constantly bounced, there were days and sometimes two weeks where I just felt terrible, there were days where I want to turn to self harm, there were days when I just wanted to stay in bed and cry. Right now, I wouldn't say that I'm ""fixed"" or ""Healed"". I still have my ups and downs. I'm still anxious about my future, I don't have a dream or a goal. But my counselor told me that i'd need a year. Maybe for you, it will take a year or two too. But you need to keep swimming. The fact that you made this reddit post is already proof that you're resilient. You want to fight, you still want to have a future. So remember how you feel and keep swimming. Keep moving even in days where you can't. Set bare minimums for your daily life. You don't want to wash your face or groom yourself? It's okay, at least take a shower. You don't feel like jogging? It's okay, just go for a walk or roll around your bed. [Here's a video/song that honestly pushed me to get help. The show itself was a huge mood booster since the main character wanted to get help and get better too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK2DlLmVc20) This [is also a really good ted talk that I listened to about depression.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) He mentions a man that he met who went through all sorts of therapy and took so many types of medicine. Despite trying so much, the depression still stayed. In the end, the man went for a brain surgery which successfully helped him. Even though he went through so much pain, he still chose to fight and live because he still carried hope deep inside of him. "" And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more."" Remembering that helped me a lot."
e045wec,sageadam,"Hi, you probably already knew this but depression is caused by chemical imbalance of the brain and the negative emotion you felt are due to the broken down communication system in your brain.

I read that you are taking medications and that is good. Maybe you can adjust your medication intake or try other types of medication if the current one are not helpful enough. There is no one size fits all approach in treating depression. Trial and error is required to find the correct medication formula for each individual. 

I am troubled by the fact that your physiatrists stopped caring after a while. To put it bluntly, they are paid to care. If they are impatient towards you, they are frankly bad at their job. Please don't be disheartened by them and seek for a better physiatrist that can truly help you. "

Thank you for the kind words and for the advice! I keep forgetting that battling dep is a long race and not a short one. Helps keep things in perspective.

Did you happen to see any good therapists or mostly rely on helping others? I've been volunteering with the spca, if that counts. ~~On some days I'm not sure that's enough to help though :')~~

Thank you for the kind comment, encouragement and help! Its appreciated <3"
e5u5hql,Applered232,"I have an psychotic ex-girlfriend who stalked my sister's Facebook account to steal her wedding photo. That was not all. This jobless woman-child with nothing better to do but to harass my phone in the middle of the night (at 2:52am and 6:27am) to let me know that she was spreading my sister's Facebook photo that has my face to my past customers. Unknown to her, I have evidences of her consuming illicit substances, being reported on STOMP, disrespecting the privacy of her students, and committing some despicable acts in her tutees' homes. Sooner or later, her tutees will be informed about it. This issue must be resolved."

Nobody likes her due to her attention-seeking nature and she has to resort to waving her soiled undergarments to gain affection from the guys.

e0f9q6w,Southpawe,"Sorry for the late reply. Wasn't expecting this post to get this much traction so I didn't know what to say.

I'm not sure I normally seek an immediate effect, but on days when I'm down I guess I do tend to hope for some magical placebo that can help, because its disappointing to keep falling back down hard after trying for so long.

Thank you for the suggestions. Doing a group activity thing regularly is something I did not think about and your comment gives me a different perspective to doing it even if I don't feel like meeting people. Do you have examples on that? I don't have too many close friends, so one thing that comes to mind is perhaps taking up a course like cooking or baking? Not sure if that counts.

I appreciate the tips. I might honestly look into incorporating some into my daily routine. I haven't exercised in awhile, so I might just start that again slowly. And I've gotten a new notebook to write down thoughts in. Thank you, normificator."

e0gcu3g,plumpig,"Hmm. Apart from a child psychologist I gelled especially well with in my youth, I don't think I've seen a therapist I thought of as especially helpful. It's more a reflection of IMH's system rather than the doctors' skill, though. It's hard to build a relationship with your doctor when you see them only for 30mins every two weeks. Then again, the last time I had a session was slightly more than 5 years ago. Am not sure if things at IMH have changed since then.

Oh since you like animals, have you thought about fostering newborn kittens if you've the time to do so? It's super rewarding and a really good distraction from negative thoughts. 

I know how it's like to be so depressed that you can't even muster up enough energy to brush your teeth yet alone exercise or take a bus to wherever it is you're supposed to be volunteering (in your case, SPCA). But with neonatal kittehs that need to be fed at 2-4 hourly intervals depending on how young/sickly they are, you're kinda forced to step up to the plate to tend to them whether you feel like it or not. It's tough but very gratifying when you see the kittens thrive. 

Sorry if I rambled. It's 6am and am still up nursing an infected ear.  "
e04sito,coolstuffbro,"There is Care Corner which has several counselling centres across Singapore. They are open on Saturdays. There is a fee you would have to pay (based on seniority of the counsellor) but don't worry if you have financial difficulties, they will not turn you away. 

You could also try REACH Community Services. I'm not too sure if the service is complimentary but there's no harm checking with them if you are interested. "
e0favsw,normificator,"Taking a course isn’t very meaningful in my opinion because the social group seldom persist after the course has ended. Of course if you’re very passionate about the activity, that in itself could lift your mood. 

Perhaps you can try group exercise. Like a hiking group, sailing group, cycling group or rock climbing group. Has both the benefits of exercise and social activity. 

For indoor activities you could try yoga, Pilates, meditation, board games groups, musical instruments, discussion groups etc

If you’re spiritually inclined u can choose whichever religion piques your interest, these tend to be the most social but you might fall into the trap of professing things you don’t believe in because you treasure the social group, but some people are ok with that. So it’s your call really. 

You can check out the meetup app for access to these groups. 

Practice healthy boundaries. Always be ready to walk away from anything if it endangers you or doesn’t make you comfortable. Good luck OP. "
e0ffoqx,Zedwye,"No worries, I appreciate that you take the time to respond back to everyone's messages. I'm seeing both psychiatrist as well as therapist, because they both handle different aspects of my depression. A psychiatrist is more knowledgeable in precribing/managing/assigning the medicines that can help improve your mood, while the therapist is more about changing your behaviour (psychology). Personally, I think seeing both professionals are crucial in my recovery because both work together to piece together the fastest possible plan to manage depression. So like,some things you can say to your therapist is like why you're avoiding certain things, or having certain mindsets, while for a psychiatrist, you'll want to ask him/her things like why I'm feeling nauseus after eating medication, or having trouble sleeping. 

My therapist's name is Miss.Cheak Ching Cheng, but she's on maternal leave,so I'm switching to another therapist and continuing from there. If you'd like, I can let you know how my new therapist is like, although most of the work has already been done by Miss Cheak. If you need more help,feel free to ask. I'm always around reddit."
e0f9w53,Southpawe,"Hi there, sorry for the late question.

Have you tried seeing him personally before? When I tried asking, they said sessions are only about 15-30 minutes. How does that work so fast?
"
e05277b,Kxitingk,"I didn’t mean it that way. I meant that if OP is still in school, OP can go see a school counsellor, or talk to a lecturer. Cos when I spiralled into depression, that period of time I was still in school so I went to my lecturer for help. That was just a suggestion. I was suicidal too, it got to a point where I had to call a suicide hotline but I didn’t think it was much help. School lecturer lead me to a counsellor & there was where I found most useful. That’s all! Cheers. "
e06i85j,therandomopera,Thank you sir.
e0fcu9f,Southpawe,"That's true. Didn't think it that far enough.

I think those exercises are quite rigorous, a bit much for someone like myself. (I have an old leg injury, so some of those aren't as possible.) A board game group could be interesting though, I'm not too sure where to start but I guess I'll look it up.

Thank you again, I appreciate the help. You seem quite kind."
e0fa846,myepicdemise,Yes I've seen him before. That is how long each consultation typically lasts. It was even shorter if I was there just to get meds. What do you expect out of a session if I may ask? It seems like there is something else you're expecting.
e0feuz0,normificator,"Download the meetup app, I’m sure they have what you’re looking for. Good luck and I’m sure with the discipline you will feel better in 6 months. "
e0fcm8y,Southpawe,"I see, is it still effective with each consultation being so short?

My previous meets with other therapists have all been at least 30 mins - 1 hour sessions so seeing 15-30mins was a bit surprising for me.

How do you have enough time to discuss the problems you're facing? Do they offer things to try or exercises to do to make yourself feel better etc? I'm not sure how a shorter session works."
e0fdrbu,myepicdemise,"He is first and foremost a psychiatrist, so his job is mainly to prescribe medication because he is a **medical doctor**. I'm sure he knows how to conduct therapy and you can request for longer consultation sessions, but he is overqualified for that, and not to mention you're overpaying for psychotherapy because as a specialist doctor, his consultation charges are much higher than psychologists or counsellors. You'd usually look for psychologists or counsellors for psychotherapy, unless you don't mind overpaying. I think you're confused as to who you're looking for."

d78w8af,sadface-,"what's your behaviour like when youre high/ low?

i'm in this odd place because i have bipolar ii as well but my symptoms were far milder than everyone else's. there's the usual loss of motivation and inability to feel any sort of reward or fulfillment (dopamine/ serotonin not working i guess) and constant anxiety over nothing, but nothing like not being able to get out of bed for a few days (most ive gone through is one or two). and when im high i just feel very uncomfortable with who i am. 

im very stable now, although im almost certain i will relapse in the future. most people do. but yeah i think you understand that there is a sort of solidarity amongst people with mental illnesses, and i feel like i had it wayy too easy. i don't wish i had it worse just for authenticity or anything like that, it was harrowing enough, and it took me nearly 10 years to get past it (early teens haha) but still...

1) how stable/unstable did you get? at my worst, about 6 months before I was due for my medical checkup, I got really bad and had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks on suicide precautions. I also have ADD so my psych wrote me a letter saying I'm not fit for active duty/would require constant supervision. i don't know if that's the norm for being exempted from NS or not. 

2) what do you say when people ask if you've been for NS? because i didn't enlist at all, I have no idea about vocations/coys/whatever so I can't fake it. my parents are foreign and I don't have any close friends to ask about what I should say. so now i just say I was exempted for health problems so it's pretty awkward. "
d784n9f,swimNotsink,"Don't go google those webMD otherwise you already have cancer :p

The best way to know is of course get diagnosed by a medical professional. 

**However, like any mental afflictions it is almost always the people around you that notice rather than yourself. Now this is where things get iffy. Due to the lack of awareness in mental health, many signs tend to get missed out by both the loved ones and the patient themselves. **

Patient: Paiseh, scared ppl say me siao lang

Loved ones: he liddat one lor, huh no la not siao! later other ppl see you wierd. 


So I would like to raise up an important point: There is nothing wrong about having a mental illness. It is just like any other illness. People take insulin for diabetes, so I take lamotrigine for my bipolar anything wrong? 
Its a social stigma thing really, and we have to get rid of it because many people are suffering in silence and ironically, it is the loved ones that cause them most pain. 



But generally speaking, Bipolar 1 is extreme mania and depression. Bipolar 2 is hypo-mania (less severe) but major depression. 
Mania is actually quite scary if you ask me. Severe cases of mania are those who are deluded with ideas like they are superman and can fly. Due to their unawareness of what is happening, some 'commit suicide' that way. Major depression is basically a high risk of self harm (suicidal attempts). Hypo-mania is a lesser form of mania that is usually not jialat but may be good in some instances like heightened creativity and very energetic. 

As the condition's naming suggests, bipolar sufferers swing from one mood to another constantly. There are also other 'in between' called mixed episodes but I will not talk about it here unless someone else asks. 

Some people have asked me, is it like girl's periods? I don't know honestly. Need to ask a girl with bipolar for that question haha. But bipolar is NOT multiple personality disorder.

Edit: Sorry, missed out on 2nd part of your qn. 
When I was in NS, my depression slowly crept up on me. As the days went by, I was getting worse so I knew I had to seek help. Because I had prior experience of depression I can self identify if something is about to go very wrong. When I knew I was about to break, I quickly sought help. Then again, NS still has a long way to go about aiding the REAL patients so it was a terrible and tedious experience for me. I'm glad its over now. "
d78q8cb,swimNotsink,"There are quite a few I've heard such as it being the same as Borderline personality disorder (multiple personality) or that its like schizophrenia. But of course, they are not the same. 
I do agree that mental illnesses are very abstract and difficult to fathom but there is also the big issue of social stigma that prevents people from understanding them. If more open discussion and education is being done, we can slowly eliminate this stigma. 
This is what is happening now: ""Mary is diabetic la, she can't drink soda""
What I hope to happen in the future: ""Mary is depressed (or any other mental illness), lets give her some space to let her relax."" and not ""Oi, wet blanket sia! So anti social one you"" 



When did I realize I might be bipolar? I knew something was wrong and with my history of depression, I could tell that something was not right. After I went to consult a doctor, then I was officially diagnosed with bipolar. Here's a part which I posted to someone's question earlier. 
>When I was in NS, my depression slowly crept up on me. As the days went by, I was getting worse so I knew I had to seek help.

d7849fj,swimNotsink,"Yes, you can put it that way. 

Its not that you literally become a 'vegetable' of sorts but rather it feels like that. 

Like I mentioned, the medications typically interact with your brain chemistry muting out stuff so usually undesired results may happen as well. 

I've had such a instance before on anti-psychotics and its not a pleasant feeling. You just feel very empty inside and nothing interests you. Even sleeping all day feels like 'ok I sleep' rather than 'ok, going to sleep'. Its quite abstract la. 

Add: Probably another easier simulation would be the feeling where you are 'looking at someone' but your mind is focusing on somewhere else. So you get that 'blank' stare thingy. Except in this case, your mind is empty. "
d784s0z,swimNotsink,"If I could, I'll go gvt hospital because its definitely cheaper. But the queues take MONTHS and at that point of time, I was unstable and in 'crisis'. If I snapped, it might have been disastrous. If you can afford it, private saves you a lot of time and is more accessible (like last minute need help). 

I'm not sure what you mean by doctor's experience but for me, my psychologist (who I was consulting in my teens) recommended him to me.

If you're talking about public vs private, I have no idea on how to compare cuz I didn't get a chance to try the public one. However, I know of a friend who sees a gvt psychiatrist and she says its good. "
d786np8,swimNotsink,"Yes I went through BMT. Was Pes C when enlisted. After BMT in tekong then posted to somewhere to continue training for stuffs at the new posting which separated us. Some from same platoon same posting as me. But I don't really socialize other than my bunkmates and sadly none were with my posting. No one really knew my condition because most of us know how to hide too well. But in my new unit, at the 1st book out I took the courage to tell my encik  (privately of course) that I am going to seek help and he supported me. The whole unit was very supportive in a discrete way and there were also some seniors who have depression so they could empathize and I am forever grateful for that. They didn't downplay such issues at all. 

But because NS will persistently try to post you here and there to let you serve the nation 'comfortably', I got bounced to another unit in another location whilst I had to regularly report to the MMI (military medical institute). That new unit, the people are nice but my first impression was really horrifying. The female superior wanted to speak to me on the first day. She asked something like 'so what is your problem? why did you get posted here?"" I told her my history then she proceeded to laugh and said something like ""aiya just emo lah, don't worry, this unit good one"". I do understand it might not be intentional but its because of such interactions that downplays us, makes us even more hesitant to seek help and suffer in silence. 
Also I'm not saying this is a fact but I feel that the way NS scrutinizes us like we are all kengsters actually makes it very distressing. The best thing I did in my short NS stint was to seek help from a private psychiatrist. I know we'e all heard the stories about 'private doctor write letter down pes!'. But not all of us do that. Some of us really need help and in terms of help rendered in the amount of time, private is the best way to go. In the NS environment you can be charged for many things and its very stressful really. 

Also I must add, you are not allowed to seek outside help due to rules and whatnot. I couldn't go to a private doc at first because of such regulations so  my best bet was to go to IMH. Its very funny because there was this indian doctor that was seeing me and I told her my predicament (I wasn't allowed to seek help. MUST see superior first to give approval). She literally called the unit and fked them. It was really funny. Its small issues like this that makes it even scarier. Government hospital can fight with the 'rules of NS'. What does that tell you about the system really. "
d7865zt,ScoobySharky,Asking the right questions
d785q5c,swimNotsink,"Yeap, I do fap. Depends, but typically a few times a week. "
d783zdm,swimNotsink,"Yes unfortunately, most medication that 'moderates' a person's mood does have a sedative-type of effect on the mind. In fact, many anxiety medications are almost literal sedative / acts like one. 

Depending on the severity of her moods, sometimes the strong dosage is necessary. However, she should discuss with her pdoc if they could try different meds to see what suits her. 

The no personality thing is very real. Because of the medication which pretty much interferes with the brain chemistry so it mutes out certain parts and of course like any other medical issue, there is no miracle drug that only 'removes' what you don't want. "
d7875wc,swimNotsink,"I've always been shy but able to mingle well in small groups. I wouldn't say I'm very social but I'm slowly coming out of my shell and being able to do things by myself (such as going out shopping alone). Sounds like mundane tasks but its a big step really. For most depressives, trying to 'go back to how it was' is not easy and it will never ever be the exact same. 

Without meds, I was in one mood state or the other. Quite awhile when I was un-diagnosed I had these anger-irritated episodes at my family and usually locked myself in my room because I couldn't 'concentrate' on my assignments. But now that I think back, it was actually one of the mixed episodes (I say 'I think back' because it is very difficult to be self aware about your state of mind if you aren't experienced; so at that time, I didn't think anything was wrong). It wasn't that bad for me but I could have a better quality of life if I got my condition under control. 

With meds now,  I am able to organize my thoughts better. Now that my mood is largely stabilized, I'm not hindered too much by the different moods and slowly take back my life. 

I'm still single and honestly, have no inkling of dating anyone currently. Maybe haven't met the right one yet. "
d78puav,swimNotsink,"Only my family and a few friends knows I'm pes F. As much as I try to be open about my condition and state, its still a touchy subject especially in Asian culture. Sometimes I wish to tell my relatives but my family don't see the need for it and well, filial piety la, just respect their wishes lor. 

People who know about my condition are those I trust and they don't really care honestly. There may be the occasional joking on 'wa don't need serve NS shiok leh' but otherwise, its no big deal. 


I wish to be able to stop taking any medication altogether in the future but deep down, I know its unlikely since my problem is likely due to brain chemical imbalances. Every review with my pdoc I discuss about lowering the dose / being off it altogether but it probably won't be anywhere near soon. But I must say initially when I was off any anti psych and just on lamotrigine, it was at 400mg. Now its 200mg. 

Medically speaking, regarding the long term effects of psych drugs I am unable to give you a definitive answer cuz I don't have the knowledge. But the worsening of condition due to long term taking is not unheard of. Which is why regular visits to your pdoc is important. Such issues has to be raised and medication can be changed / titrated. But typically long term 'problems' are due to side effects like lithium's liver damage.

However, put it this way: Do I really have a choice? Yes some people are able to manage their condition with psychotherapy (talking with psychologist) without medicine but not all of us are lucky to be able to do that. Ask any diabetic / asthmatics if they could be off their mandatory medication and all of them will tell you 'bo bian; no choice'. "
d78pkj6,swimNotsink,Pes F is a NS status and that it means I am fully exempted from NS. 
d78qn84,swimNotsink,"I haven't officially started working yet but I did do some short freelance stints here and there. I mean of course for freelance no one really needs your NS info. 

Honestly, your friend doesn't really need to care so much. Its his/her life. Already got a record in IMH, already got a pes F. But so what? its not like you can do anything 'special' to remove these. This is the very first step in taking back your life. It is just understanding that you simply happen to have more 'information' in your records but it doesn't make you less than any other person. You just need to take medication and make changes to your life so that you can manage your condition better. If anything, people with mental illnesses are mentally stronger than 'normals'. We deal with so much shit inside our heads everyday and still able to function like any one else. (just my personal POV) You might be surprised to find out that quite a few successful people do have mental illnesses too but they don't use it as an excuse to not succeed. 


We've all heard of 'pes F jialat, how to find job?'. I've been hearing a lot of these scary tales before enlisting from non pes F people. Even though I haven't have first hand experience yet, many experienced co-workers I've met in my internships have told me that there's no such thing as 'hard to find job cuz of my NS history'. They just care about your work and whether can you bring money to the table or not. (which is logical). 
The pes F scrutinization may hold true for certain goverment jobs though, like those dealing with sensitive info like MHA etc. But otherwise, most private companies dun really give a crap about your history. 
But otherwise, the employer may just be discriminating. "
d78r87s,swimNotsink,"So far I don't have any real experience in a government psych clinic (except MMI in NS and a short consult at IMH) so generally speaking, can't say for sure. But with regards to MMI, I can see that they are trying but probably they don't have enough resources to help. For eg. there was a case (before I went to my private psych) where I had a bad reaction to the meds they gave me and I was feeling lots of anxiety and suicidal. I called them and they told me ""orh, just continue taking, its like that one. You need to make an appointment then can see doctor"". I mean seriously? If someone had a reallllllly bad trip from the medication, I think after that phone call they would probably *fly off* somewhere liao. Maybe they understaffed or whatever but yeah, this is not a good thing at all. I'm no professional but if any medicine is giving you bad side effects, you should immediately seek a doctor. Even more so regarding psych meds. This is where having the capability to find a private psych is extremely beneficial. 

Government psych I heard from my friend who is seeing one says its ok and they are helpful. So I guess the only downside (like any other gvt hospitals) is the ridiculous long queue. As for IMH, I wouldn't say its good or bad based on my short consultation stint there. But I guess the impression I got there was that it was kinda gloomy (probably due to the lighting or something). But they're not aggressive like those abusive type of facilities you see in tv shows haha.

In my teens, I've seen a total of 2 psychiatrist and 1 psychologist and later another psychiatrist (which I am seeing now). The first one I couldn't stand him cuz he like bo chup one then doesn't even look you in the eye to understand how are you. The 2nd one arrogant and then thinks I'm just trying to skip school. Recommended to my dad that I either choose to go to school or admit into a hospital. Of course I wasn't well so I choose the hospital lor. But it was expensive cuz private.. so after about 1 night there, this psychologist came to visit me and said she comes on her free time to help young cases like mine. I could connect with her so I've been seeing her in my teens for about 1-2 years and then stopped since I got a grip on my life in poly. 

Then in NS bla bla bla, went to see my psychologist again and she recommended me to the psychiatrist who she thinks is able to help me with matters pertaining to NS. And that's history~

If you ask me, it is important to find a pdoc that you are comfortable with. Based solely on my experience, there are 2 types. One has more empathy while the other is logical. Some may prefer one over the other but in my opinion, empathy seems to be lacking in most. Maybe medical professionals are burned out due to a lack of personnel but yeah, doesn't change the fact that that is what's happening."
d78ra4y,swimNotsink,"I wish your dad well too :) 

Yes the medication is important for us. Even though sometimes we have the thought of just  'fk it and dun take' but it never ends well haha."
d78s6p3,swimNotsink,"Public hospital takes MONTHS to queue and private is much more accessible at the cost of money. My family thinks the pros outweighs the cons so we are sticking with private. 

In NS, they didn't want to refer to me to public hospitals or something. So I was stuck at the MMI (yah its COMPULSORY for NS to ONLY visit there; so many rules that makes us feel even worst being trapped!). Some issues happened while in their 'care' which made it unbearable so I yolo and went ahead to seek help outside. Also, I wasn't diagnosed with bipolar in NS. The doctors there thought I had something mild so just gave me some meds and 'directed' me to go back and serve. They don't really give a crap about you honestly but just what they think. What they say will be the decision. Obviously I don't have a medical license but even so, private practises cannot anyhow diagnose one ma. So yeah, I'm not being a prick by condemning them. I'm just saying it as it is. "
d78uev1,swimNotsink,"I had a rough start during my 1st year cuz I was like a hikkikomori shut in from my exemption all the way till uni started. But I persevered and managed to do well for my 2nd year. 

As usual, not quite big on socialising. Small groups will do. Small progress over time. Slowly but surely. "
d78ulsh,swimNotsink,"The best way is to see an actual psych doctor. 

Self diagnose is never ever a good thing. Sure, there may have been cases where a particular person 'caught stuffs' early on because they think they're smart but its never reliable generally speaking. So far I haven't done any 'tests' a doctor would give me? But I'm pretty sure doctors can tell if someone is lying or not. (excluding sociopaths and actors)

Some people like to ask 'am I depressed? Do I have <mental illness>? ' 

I'll say this though: Everyone experiences some degree of feeling depressed but its just a matter of the severity and duration of it. Anything negative that stays on prolonged is never good. Its like if you got a stomachache, you'll probably just brush it off and attribute it to something mild. However, if you start to realize that it begins to happen more and more constantly, you'd automatically think of seeking a doctor. Its pretty much the same with most mental illnesses. BUT the main difference is that it is very difficult to be self aware and that you have to depend on others to point it out to you. When I'm in hypomania, I don't think 'omg I got hypomania', unless I actually ask myself,  am I having an episode right now? Many of us without experience, don't really ask ourselves such questions because its unnecessary. So many of us tend to 'slip' into these states of mind that we are not aware of. (which is why insanity cases do carry weight). 


For other symptoms such as hallucination and delusions, it is very clear what you should do. Just like high fever or constant diarrhea, its a red flag.


Referrals may help reduce costs so it would probably be good to have any. (but im not sure how this works though)"
d78z7l1,swimNotsink,"You could be someone with a higher than usual rate of self awareness (high functioning bipolar). Which I think I am as well. We tend to be able to identify stuffs we are going through quickly and able to design a plan of action to alleviate problems. Basically very self sustaining and able to master the ways to help ourselves.

I went through that phase of ""I seem like so much more functional than others, am I really bi polar or just psyching myself out?"". Honestly though, just focus on the fact of you taking medication. Do you go off the rails if you don't take your meds? If you don't, maybe you can discuss with your pdoc. If you do, then there's your proof that you indeed are bipolar / have whatever type of mental illness. 

Hmm nature versus nurture is very subjective due to the different types. For me its chemical imbalance so nature is already a factor. But nurture can help in terms of coping with the condition. "
d78xmrm,swimNotsink,"IMH no, but private psych hospital yes. "
d78xp5y,swimNotsink,"Yes, in my teens. Tried to slash my wrists but didn't do anything eventually. Lucky I had an okay relationship with my family and that's what kept me back from doing it. Otherwise, I probably would have done it. "
d78y8py,swimNotsink,"My uni is not one of the 3 big uni in SG. But I don't see any reason why having a mental illness will affect your uni application. After all, your grades are determined by your own work and you are paying the school. Not the other way round so... yeah. 

But anyway, in my case, I could choose to declare if I had any medical related stuffs I want it to be known to the school. These would probably aid in examinations like if you're color blind, you might need help on certain papers etc. Otherwise, I don't see any issue. 

Thanks for the encouragement :)"
d793bod,swimNotsink,"Sure. :)

1: Well, I had auditory hallucinations and night terrors (couldn't sleep without lights on). I didn't go over the edge with suicidal attempts yet but the constant thoughts were there. It was pretty much 'at the cliff' for me. I don't know for sure how they vet exemption cases but for me, I think my history as a teen with depression also contributed to 'validating' my newly diagnosed bipolar. 

2: I try to curve the answer depending on the question structure because my family doesn't want me to be too 'open' about it. So if relatives would ask like 'You finish NS le hor?' I will say something like 'Yah, now study uni lor'. They don't usually proceed to ask anything further. Sometimes they ask like what unit so I'd say the unit I was assigned to (just before I got exempted lol). If they ask even deeper, then I'll have to tell them oh i got exempted. But so far no one asked that far. 
> *The best lies are half truths*

For friends and trusted people, usually when they ask about NS I just tell them straight in the face I'm pes F haha. Because they ain't the 'jurisdiction' of my family.
But it just depends on your personal comfort level on how much you are willing to share. Remember, you have a choice to share whatever you wish. No real obligations really. 

You say you didn't enlist at all so I guess it would be harder for you to half lie. Honestly, if I were you, just follow the policy of, no ask-don't tell. Besides if people were to shun you just because of that, they are not worthy of becoming your friends or something you want to be related to :p"
d798syg,throwaway05_09,">  I also have ADD so my psych wrote me a letter saying I'm not fit for active duty/would require constant supervision. i don't know if that's the norm for being exempted from NS or not. 

You definitely didn't get exempted due to ADD (PES E at the very most). They were likely already considering exempting you due to your suicidal thoughts."
d78vtfv,jinhong91,Is it somewhat accurate to assume that your mood swings is similar to how it feels like before/after shitting? That's one of the sensations that I know that goes 180 very fast.

d78vr6l,,"Hitching on to this, I highly recommend NSFs to visit CHAT at *Scape before they enter the army and request for a referral to a hospital as soon as possible. When you continue with your doctor within the hospital, your MO within your camp will recognise that doctor as a person you are familiar with and will allow you to use it as official appointments to further help yourself.

 MMI is NOT the end all be all and you'll probably hate everyone in there so try your best to find an alternative before you get hit with the ""oh well too bad we'll send you to MMI""."
d794ebr,gonehipsterhunting,">yah its COMPULSORY for NS to ONLY visit there

Was that something that they told you or something that is the actual truth which you had read somewhere ie directives or something.

I'm not trying to be a dick, cause the thing is there is usually a lot of uncertainty as to ns medical policies in general, and its a lot of 'my friend said' 'my sir said' 'one of my friend's campmates' etc. but most of us don't really know if that is the truth or not. Were you ever told of any consequences for visiting an external shrink?



"
d78xwbf,,How was it like to stay there?
d7998nr,throwaway05_09,">  But it just depends on your personal comfort level on how much you are willing to share. Remember, you have a choice to share whatever you wish. No real obligations really. 

Unfortunately for me, I've always been repeatedly questioned if I don't tell, so I'd usually just say it in a matter-of-fact manner. I guess this is fine in an informal social setting. I'd have to be careful not to do so in workplace where people could gossip."
d78w0g6,swimNotsink,"Lol that's a first analogy of its kind i've heard. Good one. 

Well there is a difference actually. You see, before you shit you feel something is coming out. And after you shit, you feel your bowels cleared. You have an idea of what is going on. You can even feel if the shit is halfway or fully out already. 

Now, bipolar mood swings can happen at a snap of fingers. We normally don't even realize it until its been awhile. Like my first attribute to tiredness would be ""oh didn't sleep well last night la"". When actually, I could have already slipped into a depressive mood. As the hours go by, 'symptoms' would start to show which would confirm if I'm having an episode or not. It takes experience to recognize and able to self reflect till the point where it sorta becomes instinctive and you roughly know if something is on or not. Ok put it in a gaming context. You see the boss didn't cast debuff on you but your hp keeps dropping minimally. Then when you notice your hp red only then you realize you got some form of debuff which you didn't know about. 

That being said, it doesn't mean patients like us have no way to help ourselves. One way is to avoid our stressors and to understand them so we can set precautionary actions to take if it gets bad. The other is of course, to have a level of self awareness. "
d785ftj,swimNotsink,"For me, its around $300 ish for 3-4 months depending on when is the next review. 

Expensive but no choice :/ Those who are taking like 3 different tablets are a lot more expensive "

Glad you could see the irony in it. :p"
d78rc2m,swimNotsink,"When I was on anti psychotic, I wasn't horny at all so nope I didn't really fap during that time. Now that I'm more stable, my 'emotions' are just like any other typical guy. 

So yeah, its the latter. "
d7857nr,swimNotsink,"It varies from person. But I'm pretty sure I'm a rapid cycler. Some *days* I cycle between sad and happy and sad. Some moods hang for 1 to 2 weeks. Like either I'm productive and creative and energetic for 1-2weeks, or I'm sad and down and finding it difficult to motivate myself to do anything. 

Usually non-rapid cyclers switch moods between months. "
d78t1ad,swimNotsink,"Thanks :) 

It took me very long to be honest. Its been like 4 years and I'm just starting to pick up the pieces. It takes a lot of time really. "
d78ryfs,swimNotsink,"No prob. 

Generally speaking, I feel that those born after 1990's tend to be more open minded and have access to a lot of information to read about such conditions. Its like the gay rights thingy where more of the younger generation is being exposed to information that allows them understand about what it is etc. But I don't think the reality of mental conditions is at that stage yet unfortunately. 
Yes some people who are totally ignorant will inadvertently hurt us with their comments. If I'm feeling up to it, I will try to explain to them but caution that this may elicit some backlash of you being a prick so... yeah. Otherwise, just stay far away lest it triggers your condition etc. 

My family is the conservative type so when I was having these first symptoms, I didn't know what was going on. My family also didn't know what was going on. And this is a very dangerous thing because when emotions run high, small things can turn into physical altercations. (if they don't know what is wrong, they assume something else so misunderstandings start to snowball then... well it never ends well)
But now that I'm stable, things are okay. We don't share stuffs to be honest, and we never did. My family is your typical asian stereotype where sharing stuffs like angmo parenting doesn't happen much. But we have a mutual understanding of each other ba. Just that we don't say it out loud. "
d78vpq9,sadface-,"tagging /u/swimNotsink so he can chip in

bipolar ii too, although it's very mild now thanks to lithium and me having spent the past 5-6 years building an incredibly strong support system and untangling deep-rooted issues. 

i went via the polyclinic route because it was cheaper. from experience if you inform the GP seeing you that your case is severe and you need immediate attention you can get an appointment on the same day. not always, but followup will be real quick. 

/u/swimNotisink is right in that there are two types of pdocs, and the polarity (hur hur) is even more obvious in IMH. i dont blame them, theyre overworked and drawing a paycheck that isn't amazing, answering to this massive bureaucratic system. 

so yeah, you may find a few pdocs who keep their head high and make you feel comfortable enough to open up, but most of them are just here to diagnose you, give you your medication and have you fuck off till your next appointment. 

and of course because they see like a billion patients a week and rotate roles ever so frequently, you won't always see the same doctor and neither can the doctor remember your issues and you have to tell your entire life story again. it can be infuriating. it's better than nothing though.

that being said, IMH is pretty amazing in that the system takes patient feedback and welfare very seriously. i went through a few of those 'unempathetic, logical' doctors before i decided that it was hindering my treatment. told the hospital, now im seeing the same senior doctor for the rest of my time here (which is incredibly infrequently actually, im stable enough that i can afford to see him once every few months)

im generally very cynical about bureaucracies but i do think the system for IMH looks out for its patients, or at the very least, responds to patient feedback. i think consensus is that private doctors are still better for all the reasons listed in this AMA so far but IMH is definitely not incompetent.

if your condition acts up do note you can walk into their A&E any time, costs around 100 or so though.. but as with polyclinics you can talk about financial issues with one of their counsellors and work something out. "
d78w3qu,swimNotsink,"Yes this is very good advice. Usually once you are already 'inside the NS system' it becomes very tricky and complicated due to the huge amount of rules and stuff. It doesn't help one bit due to the amount of kengsters so... yeah, better to seek help early. 

If people say you keng then let them say lor. Its your life and there's nothing wrong trying to protect it. Doctors also cannot suka suka just give you diagnosis anyway. 

Just remember that in NS, its like a paradigm shift. The 'laws' that apply to a civilian do not ncessarily apply to NS. So yes, its veeeeeeery messy and can cause many problems. "
d795ajy,swimNotsink,"I'm no expert on NS laws but I didn't take this from reading somewhere. It was communicated to us (in NS). There's a similar general rule and that is to 'always report to your camp superiors first and never ever go ahead outside; only when they approve then you can do whatever you want'. 

I haven't actually seen what happens if someone went ahead to break these (pretty sure punishment of likes would be hush-hush anyways). But one of the consequences which can be linked to any NS policies is that you can be charged for a lot of things; detention barracks is hardcore. And with the 'ambiguous threats' that is being put nicely, it becomes very unsettling for someone with mental afflictions under that system. AWOL is not an option, in camp also too stressed out, what can I do? If i seek outside help will I be charged? Even if I go out and straight to IMH, they also have their hands tied due to 'NS regulations'. Yes, there is such a thing. Don't get me started on how the 'you only need to know / ask questions relevant to your rank' is even worse for people like us.


Whether or not these constraints / directives are legit I cannot verify. If you've been through NS before, the culture there is such where its not uncommon for lies like these to be construed by the higher ranked to benefit them. You would also know different camps have somewhat different practices which makes it even more complicated.


If there exists a resource before enlisting to read up on all the regulations to prevent being 'smoked', I would recommend it to anyone about to enlist. But as far as I know, there isn't. So what are the patients in NS supposed to know? Honestly NS is not the same as civilian life, which is rightfully so. But people who physically and mentally do not belong in the army, will have issues and the system is still far from being perfect to accommodate all."
d78y7fc,swimNotsink,"Its actually very peaceful. What you see on TV is not always an accurate portrayal. Yes, you may have some 'screamers' in other rooms but they get sedated anyway.

d78xmlz,petit_four,"Have you tried taking the prescription from your pdoc then filling it outside? When I was seeing a private pdoc and the cost was killing me that's something that helped to some extent. Had to pay $10 for the script, but buying it from SGH [or any other public hospital pharmacy] was marginally cheaper. Still doesn't beat internal prescriptions from the hospital because you have to pay full price and GST on top of that, but it's as good as it gets."

That is the thing because we all don't have such examples and we don't want to be the first.

I was never aware of the not being able to consult any outside doctors though.

The lack of verification only serves to benefit the army. I know what you mean as to the different camps and units having different practices which ultimately results in different consequences for people.

cjbxmv9,aejhaefg,"Hi, I made a post about the very sad case of Ganesh the NSF, linked here.

http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/226gqt/nsf_with_history_of_schizophrenia_pushed_to/

Don't worry about this too much. The way that the SAF operates after a tragedy occurs is to always err on the side of caution, and if I know those backronym obsessed pencil pushers well enough, I'd say that they already have some simplistic flowchart out there which automatically sorts you into a vocation which won't exacerbate your condition. They will also most likely be posting you to a unit where there are at least a few SAF counsellors, and where the officers and NCOs will have knowledge of your condition. This will ensure that your basic mental welfare is assured. At the same time, people have short memories, so remember to seek help immediately if you are under great emotional stress.
 "
cjcnacp,,"Went through the same thing. Don't worry NS nowadays is pretty easy. I was loaded up on anti-depressants and sleeping pills for my two years. And they were free. So just take your meds, suck it up, before you know it you'll be outta there.

Edit: I'm bipolar as well. Just gotta be aware when you are going through a manic or depressive phase and adjust accordingly. It's sad to say but not many people here are gonna cut you any slack coz they don't understand it. You just gotta do what you gotta do to get by "
cjd7cq3,Heroicdeath,"No one should have to ""suck it up""; I absolutely dislike the use of that phrase, it just gives a negative, carefree attitude towards issues of importance such as mental health.

cne6vzm,lurkatrd,"You make 10k a month and you owe 19,800 dollars?

I think you could probably resolve this issue within 5-6 months, no? 

Stop spending on all unnecessary items, live like a monk, pay for your rent, buy beer from the supermarket, eat at hawker centres, and payback your loans (4-5k a month)?

You should also ban yourself from the casinos, and install site blockers on your computer to prevent yourself from gambling.

Gambling is a psychological phenomenon, willpower is one thing but if you feel the compulsion to gamble again, seek help from that National Council on Problem Gambling, the ones who predicted Germany's win.

Take care, dude."
cne45kh,forgot_account_again,"Hey, sorry to hear that you got caught up in such a situation.

cne4fzx,apfaals,"Not sure about laws in Singapore but If you feel it's serious enough you could declare bankruptcy, you won't have to pay your debts but everyone will know and your assets will be taken.

cne5d2x,not_a_theorist,I'm sorry to hear about your situation but I can relate to it. Singapore's work environment is cold and harsh..
cne4e5l,ke86,"few things: 

1) if you are expat from the US, keep in mind that you need to save away 30% of your income to pay for tax. so do not think making a 10k means you can use it all.

2) if you are 27 and have successful career, hopefully you have some friends back at home who are as successful. it will be hard but try to get some money from them to pay back money lenders here. 

3) if that fails, i assume you have credit card back at home. use cash advance and pay for the debt here. again, i'm assuming if you make $100k+, you should probably have a credit line to withdraw that much

wish you luck kid. it's difficult away from home."
cne5can,fierysnow,"i think the first thing you should do is pay off your debts ASAP, especially since you borrowed from moneylenders (loansharks?). try talking to your boss. some companies pay ahead if you have urgent difficulties (or maybe i watch too many dramas? correct if wrong), so if your boss is understanding you could get 2 or 3 months of forward pay to pay off your debts first. 

as /u/apfaals said, you could try declaring bankruptcy, but your employers might not react well to that so you might wanna do some research on that first. also this will not deter loansharks from hounding you so if you choose this path you might have to also seek protection from the police if they start causing trouble."
cne6kou,erisestarrs,"I'm not exactly sure if [Credit Counselling Singapore](http://www.ccs.org.sg/) works with expats but you should call them up - they have programmes to help you deal with debt management and repayment. Even if not, they have [a page with lots of useful links](http://www.ccs.org.sg/library/page/useful-links) that you can try. 

I think recognising that you have a problem is the first step to solving it - so that's good. All the best to you as you deal with this!"
cne7mjh,pigtrotsky,"Sorry to hear of your predicament. Out of interest, are you sure you can't get a loan from a bank? If you take your payslips into DBS I suspect you could get a cashline set up for at least 10K, which you could put half of your current payday loans into.

You really need to stop gambling, and stop taking out payday loans. Both are dead ends, and all the advice in the world won't help if you continue in this direction.

Get as much as you can moved in to traditional loan products and then pay down the balances on the payday loans with everything you have until they are gone. The nature of these loans is that the interest rate is so phenomenally high along with the penalties, that you'll remain dependant on this credit and eventually, you'll be in too deep to pay it back."
cneosv6,,"Hey, look at the brighter side of things. You're only 27 but you've got a very well paying job. You're travelling the world making your career on your own.

Now, if you know gambling is your Achilles Heel, find another activity or hobby to replace it. Go cycling, go to the gym, pick up online gaming.

I'm not too good with credits and what not, but I think if you have enough credit limit with a legit bank, then use that credit to pay off money lenders, consolidate your debts and work out a repayment scheme.

If you're going to declare bankrupt over 20k, You are probably going to lose your job and whatever you have bulit up.

Stop letting it snowball, get help from [Credit counselling](http://www.ccs.org.sg)

cnes0np,yourm3,"depression is something that only you can overcome by yourself. take part time jobs to resolve this issue.

if the money lenders are not the legal kind, kindly proceed to the police. you still have to pay for what you owe though.

cnetg05,chobotong,"Idk about the financial stuff but if you're depressed please go see a psychiatrist. Don't listen (too much) to people who say things like you'll be okay stay strong etc. That's for the doctor to decide. Depression isn't about ""staying strong""/""keeping your chin up""/""insert silver lining here"" but is rather entirely physiological (etc low seratonin levels hence loss of appetite, all this manifests as depressive thoughts). Don't be worried about having to take anti depressants (apart from the having to pay for it), there's nothing wrong with it just as there is nothing wrong with using an umbrella to shelter yourself from rain or wearing spectacles because you're short sighted. Do your best :)"
cneu43b,Giften,"Sorry i can't really provide any help, but i'm really curious whats your occupation that earns you over 10k a month at 27?"
cneua5a,the_wulk,"Very sorry this happened to you, but it indeed sounds like a small issue. You make more than enough to easily cover your debts (Compared to others). You just gotta suck it up and put your nose to the grindstone for a couple of months. 

Hopefully you can gain some discipline and rid yourself of the poisonous gambling habit, although from your back story it sounds like gambling is an addiction and you keep relapsing. You may need to see a professional about this.

As for your financials. As what other reddiporeans have advised, go to the police if you got yourself involved with illegal money lenders. 

If, like you mentioned, you can't get the authorities involved because it may cost you your job, once again, I'm so sorry but you probably gotta suck it up, pawn some stuff to get cash for your daily expenses.

but he could be suicidal. just make sure to talk to him and see what he says. suicidal people tend to talk about leaving stuff to others etc. 

just keep an eye on him for a while. try not to piss him off. just listen to what he says if he wants to talk. usually they want to be heard than to be given advice. 

thats all i rmb from my volunteer days. hopefully this passes in a few days once the gf situation resolves......."
dvvzh8n,,"has he exhibited suicidal behaviour before this?

if you guys are usually open to talking to each other. try to broach the topic of his gf and talk to him about it without bringing up the slitting wrists incident. just talk him through his relationship problems, listen, respond and give advice if asked - basically have a normal heart to heart talk. if he's willing to share about his suicidal stuff then take it, otherwise if he seems clammed up on it, don't push it.

regardless, whether it's purely an ""attention seeking"" or whether he ""really wants to die"" (in quotations bc these really really depend on the situation, and can be very judgemental and unhelpful in many cases) the fact that he physically hurts himself as a response to negative emotion is NOT good and should be addressed in some way."

dvunix2,CreditorTerminator,"How about he shouts,""I WANT TO FUCKING DIE"".  Isn't that another sign?"
dvunyy2,chxrrytomato,"Definitely another sign that shouldn't be brushed off. I second what others have said - keep an eye on him. Let him know you're there if he needs to talk, and definitely don't force him to seek help. Encourage him to talk to his support network (people he trusts, eg. You/family/girlfriend). Just remind him that help is there if he needs. In the mean time, it'll be a good idea to call SOS and let them know about the situation. SOS also has an e-mail befriending system if your brother is interested (replies in 48 hrs on weekdays). All those aware about this situation should also read up on how to help individuals with suicidal thoughts (i.e. What to say/what to NOT say, etc.)


If your brother does decide to seek help - Great! SOS is great for emergencies. Otherwise, you/your brother can book an appointment with CHAT for a check-up, or head down to any polyclinics associated with NGH as those are the ones with psychologists.


I hope this helps. I wish your brother and your family all the best."
dgrvrzx,doctorwhybother98,"Hi there,

You seem to be in tremendous distress now, but first things first: Is there any way that you can keep yourself physically safe for now? Are there any sharp objects or pills or ropes nearby that you could keep away from reach or give to someone else for safe-keeping for the time being? If you live in an apartment, can you lock your windows and have someone keep an eye on you for the next few days or so?

If at any time you feel that you're going to be at physical danger to yourself, you dial 995 without hesitation, okay? Alternatively you can walk-in to any A&E department at any hospital.

I can't promise you that things will get better, nor can I tell you that you shouldn't kill yourself. It would be morally unjust for me to make that decision for you, because this is your life, after all, and you get to decide what to do with it. 

Things are tough now, and I get that, because I've been where you are before, twice (and I identify all too much with your ruminations, so you're definitely not alone in thinking and feeling those things), but I have to say that there definitely is help available - all you have to do is want it for yourself, which you seem to already have accomplished, so kudos to you for that! :)

Another thing I should add is that suicidal feelings are not natural, and are temporary by nature, however permanent they might feel presently. 

Regarding your concern about the cost of therapy, you can receive subsidized treatment by going to a polyclinic and getting a referral to see mental health professionals (psychiatrist; psychologist). At the hospital, you can ask to speak to a Medical Social Worker, who can provide you with the subsidies you need as necessary. My payments are currently covered by Medifund for the next couple of months, which has helped lessen the financial burden of treatment. You do not have to do any of this alone - reach out to your loved ones for support if possible.

You're really brave for reaching out the way you've done, and I cannot praise you enough for that. Just take it an hour at a time, a day at a time, and keep breathing. 

My realization since my first attempt six months ago is that the good days, though they may be few and far between, are worth living for, no matter how ugly the bad ones get. 

If you need a non-judgmental listening ear and an outlet to just vent, feel free to PM me at any time. I hope you can find the strength to pull through this crisis. Do [take care](https://i.reddituploads.com/81b1167bca5f4253802e399771798329?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=650ade81000e686612bfb7217dbc8d7e)! :)"
dgrykfy,SummerPop,"TL;DR:

End your life, and you will NEVER get a second chance. Continue living, look at nature, observe human behavior and try to learn about the reality you inhabit. Life is Shit; Life is also Beautiful. Shadows always appear because there is Light.


I had suicidal tendencies, even tried to .... At the very last second before I pushed off, someone called me to stop. I looked around, nobody. Learnt later that it really was someone; that someone inhabits the same body as I.

Had more suicidal and murder tendencies, got a little insane. That voice will always calm me down, tell me to kill instead.

Nearly did the deed, someone stopped me. Instead of running away screaming. He stood there blocking my way, telling me not to waste my life behind bars, that it is not worth it, NEVER worth it. 

He and his friends later become my best friends; we are all closely knit. They all know about my insanity, all know I am a ticking time bomb. And they constantly remind me that my life is priceless, I get only one shot at life, always look beyond the darkness and you will find light.

They are my counsellors; whenever I am in despair, they always come personally to look for me and talk to me, calm me down, keep my sanity. I owe them a lot. The other person also became less... dark, and more positive. I never consulted a counsellor. I doubt a paid stranger's ability to enter my life and influence it positively.

I mended my relationships with my Dad, I try to soldier the bad times and look to the good. I found somebody I dream of a future with. 

I still suffer from 'breaks'; just that now, I have people who actually care about me, who remind me that Life sucks because Life is also beautiful. Where there is Light, there are Shadows. With all their positive energy, I suffer less 'breaks' now.

I am now learning to communicate with people, and with myself. Organize my feelings, rationalize my thoughts. Life is bad, but Life is also good.

I cannot claim to understand fully what you are going through; I am not you, neither are you me. Find your own path, keep good friends close, love your loved ones. Always remember good things come at the cost of bad, and vice versa.

All the best to you; if you choose to end your life, it may not be a bad choice. But for all we know, you could already have recovered and are living a better life in a different timeline. Why not make that timeline your current one? Its worth a shot.

I understand how you feel because I myself have slight OCD and depression. 

I understand treatment is expensive here even with subsidies it might still cost a bomb for you. 

Please dont feel this way. I believe you are an awesome person IRL. 

My own depression set my own relationship on fire. It went downhill. 
Both my ex's hated me. I felt horrible. 
Both also decided to go find another guy shortly after the break up which broke my heart even more. At that point of my time, I really felt like killing myself. The one you used to love hates you and went on to date other guys. 


I seeked help from friends and family etc.
I realize it ain't my fault that my relationships all went downhill. why? I met and dated toxic people which I was too blinded by love to see.

dgryqxk,Laricia,"Life is really terrible to people who are depressed; when things are bad it snowballs and it really does suck. It makes interaction with loved ones difficult, and the smallest misfortunes just feel amplified. I'm glad you typed all this out and posted it, because I know it's really difficult to make a direct cry for help. Things might not get better in the near future but one day it will be. Getting there is hard, but please know that you don't have to go through this alone. It's a rough time and I hope you can get the support you need, because it makes a world of difference.

Sometimes all you need is to confide in someone. All that vent up emotions isnt gonna be healthy. Everybody is here, open to talk when you are ready to. Pm me if you need to talk. Even idle conversations can be encouraging :)"
dgrzc5c,ZexionY,"Well, I'm not particularly a good enough person to comfort you but perhaps instead of dwelling on what has already happened, keep an open mind and look to the future, you might just find something worthwhile to live on for. 

Your road of life is walked by you, whether it be good or bad, walking towards the finale is the least you could do, at least live on so as to witness your very own future, rather than dying meaninglessly for a single event throughout your life, why not finish walking down the path you already have and dying with no regrets? 

Thats all i'll say, hopefully you'll live on beautifully and be happy, I never did like when girls are sad...So smile and live happily."
dgs0e3q,Fylyn,"Hello

It's embarrassing for me to even say it, but I've had many relationships that didn't end well as well, because of me. I have the tendency to think too much, which causes me to be easily insecure and mistrustful in a relationship. These problems of mine eventually come to become theirs', which causes them to feel trapped in the relationship. So they leave.

It probably doesn't matter how my relationships ended; maybe you encountered similar issues with yours or not. I only hope you know that you are not alone; I feel your pain, and I think I understand it.

I don't know about you or your background, but I hope you have people in your life who you love and loves you, as well as personal interests/hobbies. Pursue them! I crave that kind of relationship as well, but it's not integral to a happy and fulfilling life.

Also noted that you labelled yourself 'horrible, useless, and a lost cause'. I think you're really thoughtful and unselfish to not let your problems infect him, and you're great for that.

You can always talk to me (us). Wish you the best; hope to see you happy again!"
dgs18bb,Aimismyname,"Just chiming in with the rest of these people. I'm here if you wanna talk. It takes awhile for things to get better but they do. Things always change. It might get better, it might get worse, but the only way to 100% lose out is to end it before anything CAN change. Be chill. Have a chat. There may yet be a solution just around the corner."

dgt24yr,hongwen05,"Dear fellow Singaporean,

I'm not born optimistic, and so are all of us. But happiness is never about the end result of being happy, it's the journey through it.

Life is a journey on a rollercoaster ride. It's darn boring if the ride just goes up, it's the up after the down that's exciting.

Surround yourself with positive people, find peace in yourself and be comfortable with who you are.

Let yourself go sometimes, get drunk, wasted, go for a run, meditate or just doing nothing. Whatever clears your trash bin. Even computers needs to be shut down time to time.

Finally, the odds of you or us being born in this world, is 1 in 400,000,000,00. We are lucky and more importantly, each and everyone of us are unique and special.

I don't know why I'm writing this to a stranger publicly, but I have learnt to appreciate things in life, my friends, family and myself. And I hope you will to! :) 

Hongwen"
dgt3h81,uekarashi,"Hey there,

This may sound empty but you can work through it. It does get better. It's really good that you're starting to look at yourself and know that depression is affecting you and wanting to deal with it.

Keep reaching out, and you are definitely not alone."
dgt3o75,zjomea,"Dear /u/IAmThatAsianGirl,

You're on the right track by asking for help. It's not a shameful thing to ask for help, and it's not a sign of weakness. You asking for help means deep inside you believe you can get better.

I've been on the same boat as you. Very recently, in fact. I just got out of one of those really long bouts of depression that I have that goes on for weeks, even months.

The most important thing to know about depression is that it's a state where your brain lies to you. It tells you awful things that are absolutely untrue. You've got to keep that in check. Keep it in the back of your head that depression is a filthy liar. If it helps to make you feel better, talk to a friend you trust and make them your accountability buddy. Or talk to a few friends and ask them to help you in little bits. Personally, I just want people to listen to me, I don't really expect anyone to give advice. I am aware of what I have to do, I just need to feel connected with people. Surround yourself with people and don't isolate yourself. Isolation makes depression worse.

That's my 2 cents on this thing. I'd just like to thank you for posting this thread. As a person who goes through depression a lot, I wasn't aware I had options like https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg or asking for a referral from the polyclinic so I could avail cheaper services. I wish I had known these sooner so I didn't have to go through what I just did. I'm now going to contact these people to help me with my mental health. Please do, too.

We can get better, OP. Hugs."
dgs4d01,kewlkeed97,"Hello there. If you have yet to hear someone say this, then here's me saying it: ""You matter."" As what is said in other comments, the first thing you might wanna do is to get any temptations away from yourself, like any potential weapon or away from ledges. Just a suggestion, but maybe you can try to explain to this man if you have not done so. And to let someone you are close to (emotionally and physically) know about your thoughts so that they can support you when you feel that you cannot. The best parts of your life are yet to come. Stick around to receive all that happiness and love, yeah?"
dgs4h71,Firstdenial,"Please don't do it.
I had suicidal tendencies before but I fought hard enough to suppress it.

But I had a friend who had it worse. He died last year. I still feel guilt from his death, how I should have knew about his condition but chose to ignore. If anything, please share your issues with me, even if its a selfish wish of mine so I may reduce this guilt I still bear."
dgs4mok,trautsz,"Hey,

Life is full of ups and downs. These experiences serve one purpose: to help us grow. Take a step back and consider how much you've grown from your first relationship. Yes we may still fumble and make mistakes, but most importantly, we know these experiences will make us stronger.

dgs51c5,onimusha-shin,"If you want treatment and cost is an issue, try going the public route. Calling into the hotline certainly is one way also, which hopefully lands you the subsidised route.

PM me if you need more help, if I can spare the time to drive over tomorrow, I'll sit there with you while you make the call, if you can't trust a stranger to understand you right away.

dgsywgw,thechchlc,"Hi there.
First of all, I am so glad you decided to reach out, even if it is to strangers on reddit. 
I understand that it takes a lot of courage to acknowlege that you are having issues and to tell someone about it. However, I still hope you give yourself a chance. While redditers have been kind and supportive, getting the support from your loved ones (friends and family) may be more helpful (speaking from personal experience). And getting professional help is crucial. 

You are definitely not a hopeless case, no one is. In fact, the fact that you want to get help is a huge step already.

About the cost, if you are a Singaporean, it is actually relatively affordable. 
In any case, you may want to see it as an investment to a better you and a happier life.

I just want to share to you this link:
https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/ (if you are between 16 to 30y.o)
If you haven't already known, you can make an appointment with professional volunteers for free to assess your mental well-being, and they can give you referrals to IMH or polyclinics at a cheaper price. Do take a look at their website and if the thought of going there alone scares you, bring a friend or family or anyone (I would love to help if you need someone). I hope you are feeling better now, take care and all the best!"
dgt235t,cityoflostwages,"Just about everyone goes through this kind of feeling and experience when you're young. I'd almost say it is normal to have a couple bad relationships where you make mistakes and learn from it. Depression natural follows an experience like that. 

Depression, a bit of OCD, and anxiety all kinda come together and it is annoying to deal with it but it helps to talk about it and be reminded there is more to life than relationships. Focus on work/school, being fit, healthy, and enjoying your hobbies and the rest will work itself out. "
dgt3412,BareChill,"Im not too sure if it is right to hijack this post but to a small extent I do feel the same way whereby I start questioning what is the purpose of life; Is life all about working till I die; Am I living or am i simply just surviving? If life is like the way it is now, then life is pretty pointless to live on knowing that I can never run away from these life. Even though I dont consider what i am feeling now to be suicidal but the thought of it in a way can be demoralizing.

Currently im 1 year into my first job as a 24/7 IT support and pretty much you are on a 24/7 standby for work. Even on my off days, work might just pop up and might have to start worrying about my work again. Personally for me, I find a hard to simply ""switch off"" from work and I always have a tendency to worry about them. 

I have noticed that even since I started working Im prone to falling sick. I can go on a few years without seeing a doctor but even since i started working every 2/3 months I might need to see a doctor for my illness. Im not too sure if what I am experiencing now might have impacted my health but I have been coughing for the last 6 months even after frequent trips to the doctor (both western and TCM), there is no improvement. While at the same time am also suffering from some kind of a stinging pain all over my body and this only started around 4 months ago. 

Currently Im at a lost right now both for my health and my work but my priority now is to get my health back on track first. So any advice would be welcome."
dgt42zg,Krononz,"I know it's difficult to rationalise when you're suffering from depression and going through one of the bad days. But I think it's important to remember that it's not truly your fault. It's the chemicals in your brain fucking shit up for you during a bad episode.

I just hope that you're not dealing with this alone, and that your friends or family know about it.
Yeah, it's painful to talk about mental illness in Singapore, but if you hadn't already, maybe trying starting a conversation about it with your close friends or family members? That way at least you'll have a support network there for you when it gets bad."
dgt5vib,Myraidshatters,"Don't do it!!! Always think about the consequences and repercussions. Many many people will be affected, and not just u my dear reddit user. Your act of suicide can cause your family to blame themselves for not taking care of u enough. Your friends will blame themselves and be traumatized for not being able to have potentially helped u with your suicidal thoughts. And listen to me. You're not useless. After all, if u ask a fish to climb a tree, obviously it can't do so. If u need more help dont be afraid to call the hotlines that aid mentally stressed individuals. Heck, pm me even if u feel the need to. Whatever u do, dont give in to those depressing thoughts. U are much more worth and value than u think "
dgtbqjt,azevedro,"Well, only you can change yourself, so... You need to tell yourself there's a point in living and you need to summon the drive within your soul to continue. The first step is to stop sounding so negative. For fuck? u have to summon the willpower to fight. Simple as. Go watch some motivational videos on YouTube or something."
dgtd3wb,jotunck,"Hi /u/IAmThatAsianGirl,

Posting on reddit seeking help means at some level, you still have the will to live - that's great!

Keep in mind that the future isn't set in stone and people recover from depression every day, it's not a permanent condition.

Medisave can be used for depression, so please do seek professional treatment as soon as you can, it's the surest way to help you out of this situation.

Lastly, it'll be great if you can respond to this thread so everyone here knows you're still safe and haven't done anything irreversible... "

I preferred being left alone despite knowing that I need to talk to ppl, so shoot me a pm if you're comfortable to talk because at this point, your emotionals are extremely volatile."
dguvf59,brokenbird,"The fact that you are taking the first step in seeking help shows bravery and the willingness to get better. Depression and anxiety can really spiral you into that dark rabbit hole. I personally understand the pain of ruining a good relationship, but don't blame yourself. You feel that you aren't deserving of that person or you feel hopeless that all future relationships will be self-sabotage. But that isn't true. You deserve to be loved and happy. Please focus on taking care of yourself first. You are your most important person and should put yourself as first priority. I can't guarantee you will feel suddenly get better, but things will fall into place. All these negative thoughts and fears, while the feeling is real, it doesn't mean the thoughts are true.

dguyj9a,InTheSunrise,"Please don't do it, nobody should be given this much power over you to drive you to end your own life. Not your ex, not your teacher, not even your parents or the president of some country. 

I too, have Dysthymia (chronic mild depression) and Social Anxiety, pretty much two of the worst things (excluding really serious ones that require you to be warded at IMH) that can come together due to how destructive each of them already are on their own in terms of limiting your functioning ability in RL, and I am still here today despite being plagued by it for almost a decade now at 26, not doing extremely well, but I'm still alive and therefore, there's hope. Like most others, you can feel free to drop me a message if you ever need to talk/vent/complain etc, no holds barred, anything goes."
dgvbjyh,mutantsloth,"Hello. Sending some love your way! I've been there and I really know how you feel. Give yourself time, stop beating yourself up and don't put all this pressure on yourself. Step aside from thinking about relationships and maybe just do things you enjoy, or passions that you wanna explore and immerse yourself in them. It might be hard cause it feels like you are still going through a lot of pain, but keep going. Some days will be much worse than others and you'll feel like you're back to where you started. But you just need to keep putting one foot in front of the other, not look back and eventually you will be in a better place. People are more loving and accepting and kinder than you think. You just need to slowly learn to allow yourself to take it.

As for the guy, I know you are definitely feeling a lot of guilt about it. But don't beat yourself up anymore. You may have made mistakes but you're still a lovable and valuable person, it's not the end. I know it's hard to see now but he may eventually come to understand why you did the things you did. Some people are weak at times and strong at others, but nobody is infallible or invincible, you don't have to be too. "
dh292hb,kxitingk9,"Hi, 
I've been through a really abusive relationship, I self harmed, I smoked, I quit interacting with my friends, I skipped school and I slept till late. I avoided any sort of interaction and I just felt sad and dejected all.. day long. Just because of one person that didn't know how to cherish me. 

I understand that therapy is expensive in Singapore, are you still studying? Please, talk to someone. I was in the midst of my poly education when this happened and I too had suicidal thoughts. I approached my mentor to ask for help and he referred me to a counsellor. I am much better today thanks to my friends constant love and the man who picked me up. All hope is not lost, love. 
You have people that wants to love and care for you. 
Pray.. talk to someone. Don't hang up when you call SOS.

I know that stress is normal in the working world and one has to learn how to handle it. I really tried all ways to deal with it, changing my diet (eating more vegs and fruits), do more outdoor activities (jogging and swimming) and having lots of ""me"" time just sitting in my room listening only to music. But to no avail, my conditions persists, im still coughing and my body still itch every once in a while.

I myself don't think a 24 hour job is a good starting point for someone doing their first job, especially since in the IT scene where attacks come at any time and almost need to be shut down immediately. Perhaps that's why the stress is getting to you. Have you tried talking to your colleagues or more seasoned friends about it in a more serious tone ? (parents aside)"

cmwl9jy,theangrycamel,"OP, Psychiatry is a complicated business.  
  
When you're already serving NS, especially in the Army, commanders have to deal with many kinds of medical ailments and have a difficult time trying to identify how true the serviceman's condition is because let's face it, many try to get out of doing things they don't like as a solider. You'll experience a mix of skepticism + fear-of-lawsuit/family complain type behaviour from your superiors.  
  
My advise is declare, for several reasons.  
  
1. You have a proper diagnosis from a recognized (government) institution. MINDEF (or the relevant unit/body) have to keep track of these. Don't waste your time for healing/self-improvement, etc in an army camp. 
  
2. High-stress environment in NS. I don't know what your reasons were for trying to end your life and we won't probe but it's likely stress-related. You'll experience getting shouted at/abused verbally by your sergeants and such. There's the physical training aspect of it as well, which isn't as simple as just running and doing some pushups. You know your own mind and body.  
  
3. Legal ramifications. While I'm not entirely sure of this as I haven't kept track of military laws in a long time, there probably would be certain bits and clauses that would be inconvenient for you should you not declare your condition and happen to suffer an incident related to it.  
  
Declare, and get advise from your psychiatrist and CMPB docs. "
cmx62kb,hatuah,"Bro, you should declare it. I got depressed during BMT even though I was perfectly fine prior to enlistment. If you already have depression prior to enlistment, it's going to get worse after you enlist.

I'm not trying to imply that declaring your depression can get you out, but if your commanders and the Medical Officers are aware of your condition, they may be able to help you out.

But be prepared to face a bit of skepticism from the Medical Officer as there are plenty of people in NS who feign psychiatric illnesses just to downgrade in NS"

PES E minimum, PES F if they think you are at risk to others still. Good luck."
cmxepyg,MisterSparkles_,"Regardless of whether you actually want to serve or keng, you should declare. It's a legitimate condition and if anything (touch wood) happens the army side will at least know what condition you have, even if they won't know what to do and how to react. 

Of course if you want to serve properly you can make it known to whoever is reviewing you, no biggie. Unless he/she really deems you unable to serve. "
cmy7lyh,,"Go declare. Your Ns life will be a lot better. Not perfect of course but a hell of a lot better. You will get half days off to go for your existing medical appointments with your hospital and SAF pays for it. One thing to note is that saf's version of psychiatric care is still shit. So if anything happens go straight to the MO and get a long MC. Avoidance is pretty much the best way to deal with this I've figured cos they really don't know what to do with psychiatric cases. Probably you get Pes e excuse firearms at the very least. So don't worry, no access to weapons and stuff. Just go there, go through the motions and try to get yourself better. After the first couple months you will be okay. Pm me if you want to chat, I'm currently 8 months into ns with psychiatric issues too. "
cmwkiei,Dreamwaltzer,"If you wanna keng, go declare. 

If you want to put your all for army, then just keep quiet about it.

I had a friend who got out of NS by saying he was depressed. Was pes D? or something, which is basically pes pending review, till they finally decided he was too emo for NS and gave him Pes F or something. "
cmx4w3m,dashrandom,"Pardon the skepticism but you seem to be in a rather good frame of mind to be discussing your suicide attempt and depression.

You can declare if you want but you'll probably be exempted ns as pes F. If that happens, good luck finding employment in Singapore because of the huge stigma associated with mental illness here. "

I haven't gone through NS so I can't comment if it is good practice for the real world or not, but I've had a bit of a head start. If I do get classified as PES F, all hope and potential experience is not lost.

I am not that intimidated by the social stigma of being classified as PES E/F. I'm mentally ill. My first suicide attempt was at the ripe old age of 17. The stigma has already been established. I frankly don't give a rat's ass if people do stigmatize me for being an army reject. My main concern now is trying to protect myself from harm whenever possible, something I can do now while I take a short break from my bi-weekly depressive and suicidal spiral.

Can I ask, were you placed in a non-clerical vocation as PES C before your downgrade?"
cmwtflt,monanalisa,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I really appreciate it.

I've just always been like this - consistently piss poor mood, low energy, suicidal ideation; textbook symptoms - for several years. I only started realizing something might be wrong in the past few months, but I didn't want to get help. There's no significant pressure from school or parents. I actually do quite well in school, usually top 5% and above (below?) and let's just say my CV is much longer than what it's supposed to be at this age. JC is admittedly stressful, but it wasn't what led to my attempt. I did it because well my life sucks. Sure, I have a refrigerator and running water, but I don't remember what it's like to be happy. I can't remember the last time I genuinely enjoyed doing or laughing at something. I'm just not that interested in living anymore. Shitty genes, I suppose.

At the point of my attempt, I felt so indescribably lonely, isolated and hopeless. To put it succinctly, I can think of a hundred reasons to die, and a hundred ways to do it, but not a hundred reasons to live, nor a hundred ways to do it. Anyways in the months leading up to the attempt, I got close many times (attempts of the attempt? heh) doing weird shit like counting the number of pills and staring at the bottle for hours. I did lots and lots of research reading papers, case studies and meta-analysis of papers and case studies regarding the toxicity of my drug of choice. I was pretty obsessed.

I am terrified of serving NS. Not of the physical rigor, but of the mental one. I don't have problems with fitness (school team & crazy training schedules). I am terrified of the prospect of being given access to firearms and explosives. I have had dreams and fantasies of finally, successfully and irreversibly killing myself. Drug overdoses have antidotes and treatments. Bullets and grenades are much harder to treat. I have had fantasies of running away with grenades and generously applying them to my face. I actually feel slightly happier fantasizing about all of this. How fucked up is that?

I finished my A levels last month, and in the *first freaking week* post-As, I stayed in bed for four days and seriously wanted to kill myself again. I just didn't have access to any lethal means. It's been consistently hard the past few weeks, especially since I don't need to go to school regularly anymore (yes, I like school because it keeps me busy). It's not school stress that does it - with or without stress I will be fucked up either way. In fact, I think school helped to keep me focused and busy with something. The extended banality of NS is going to set me off *even more* and I don't know if I can pull through that."
cmxh7kq,monanalisa,"I'm not delirious. I apologize if any part of my post(s) indicated that I was trying to pass off as crazy or insane.

I have a mood disorder. It's a different class from things like severe schizophrenia (what you would typically view as delusional and crazy people). I am perfectly capable of rational reason, although sometimes I lose the motivation to do rational things, like seek help, or ruminate and essentially delude myself.

My brain chemistry is so messed up that I have trouble with happiness, motivation and self-preservation. I have stayed in bed for days at a time just bawwing my eyes out. I suppose part of the stigma is that I'm just not trying hard enough or that I'm lazy, or just looking for attention. I assure you, it's not that simple. Have you ever wondered why depression is documented as a mental illness? To say that being able to tackle it with sheer willpower alone is challenging, is a gross understatement. Sure, some people have managed it, but they are the exception, not the rule. Look at mental illness as a physical one - you can't just ""try harder"" your way out of a fever when you have a flu.

My mother thinks I'm malingering. She accused me of trying to keng my way out of serving NS, by creating all this drama and that I shouldn't declare because I don't need to. This was three weeks after I was discharged from hospital, after I stayed in the ICU and psych ward on suicide watch. I don't know how to convince you that I am depressed if my own mother doesn't completely believe me. 

I'm sure NS is a one of a kind experience and that you can learn valuable lessons for life. I've listened to enough stories from teachers/friends/colleagues/family to pretty much confirm it. The problem is, I am not like most people. I'm scared of NS because I might one day show up on the headlines for eating a grenade. 

Let's say I do serve like a normal soldier. What the hell do I do if I hit a really bad episode? Confide in my CO? My section/platoon/whatever-mates? First word of suicide and I'll be held under involuntary psychiatric hold that can be extended indefinitely (yes it can be extended for as long as the shrinks think you present a danger to yourself and others). So with this fear in mind, I'm not going to seek help, not like that. What now? Take the easy way out and off myself. It's not going to be difficult with access to weapons.

I'm really sorry to hear about your family. Life can throw all kinds of shit at you but I just can't handle it as well as you can. "

The brain is an organ too, so there really shouldn't be a stigma attached to going to the doctor to get any of your moving parts fixed. Those that mind don't matter and those that matter don't mind.

@OP You will most likely be put down for PES F in that scenario. You will be referred to MMI for an interview with the military's psychiatrist (PCC) and following that be put up for medical board. 

In most scenarios during the interview with the military psychiatrist, he will give two options to you to choose, get PES F or serve under careful observations by your superior and direct feedback back to the psychiatrist."
cmx9l8m,dashrandom,"If you did not serve national service, employers will ask why. It's a simple risk mitigation factor for businesses. If you tell them you are PES F, they will ask why.

dthtwla,GlassEconomics,"Just to share my experiences - I'm not sure how relevant they are to you. I went to my usual doctor with 'the leftovers of depression', who referred me to 'Nobel Psychological Wellness Clinic' at AMK, where I see a Dr Thong. He's succeeded in finding medication that works for me (something the healthcare in my native country - UK - failed to do), although it did take a year or so of experimentation, and was/is fairly pricey (although I think I'm charged more since I'm a foreigner). I think my issues fall within Dr. Thong's area of expertise, maybe he's not so helpful for OCD.

Sorry I can't help on the other questions regarding IMH and family. My answers would be too specific to UK.

Good luck with your condition. Mental health is so underrated, hope it gets manageable quickly. :)

dtgjy92,SomeguyinSG,"OP , I would suggest if you don't want to go to IMH, try NUH Kent Ridge Neuroscience, its the one that I'm currently going, thing is its more expensive than IMH though, but based on what I heard from my other NSF friend who also has anxiety like me, at least the private psychiatrists tend to spend more time talking to you as well.


I'm glad to hear you overcame your depression and learnt social skills, these are two of the many things I'm currently struggling with in NS as well.


I'm not too sure about OCD treatment, based on what I know, mental illnesses can only be managed, not fully cured. (I might be wrong though)



I'll try my best to reply you if I'm free, feel free to ask me more questions.


My recommendation to you is to write down a list of possible symptoms you have, as that was what helped me in my IMH NS Pre Enlistment checkup, and consider if you prefer budget, or healthcare wise. (honestly, money can be earned back, but health can't, so my two cents opinion is for you to go private, and not go IMH)"
dtgjw0f,eilletane,"IMH outpatient doctors are pretty caring but a few don’t really know what they are doing. It is greatly subsidised if you get a referral from polyclinic. Some are still getting their masters/phd. But it’s better than nothing. Talking to them might help you, although it didn’t for me. Just know it will be a really slow process and even slower progress. Be patient.    
   

Each session was less than $50 per hour. Ive not been to any other subsidised clinic so I can’t give you any information on that. However, I have the impression that NUH would be better as I have a few good friends working there. Although I may be a bit biased.    
You can definitely not let your parents know. However, it is better for them to know for your own mental health. They can be a good support system for you.   
   

Medication wise, it is really cheap if it’s subsidised. Xanax is the cheapest and pretty effective for panic attacks or anxiety. It’s around a few cents per pill. And it’s a take when necessary kind of pill.  
   

Private clinics are around $150-250 per hour.   It is definitely better but also I’ve discovered that they like to push expensive drugs.   
&nbsp;  


If you do decide to go get help (I strongly suggest you to since you have stepped up to be responsible for your own health. Congrats btw.) do take note that bad things might happen. Triggers will show up and it might get worse at first. Tell your doctor. And for god’s sake don’t do anything stupid that’ll land you as an inpatient. The horror stories are true.    
Soldier on. And don’t expect to come out with a ray of sunshine on the other side. From my experience, all I could do was to keep my demons at bay. But it was better than thinking  that I’ll always be broken. It’s not true, I’ll never fully heal, and that’s okay.    
    
You’ve decided to do this. It will be a long journey, but you have to start some time. Start early, cope early. I wish you the best.    
   
Feel free to ask me or pm me any questions or if you just need someone to talk to. "
dtgjw56,hiracheru,"I know bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety can use medisave. OCD maybe not though. But if u get diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder for your axis 1, i think OCD cannnnnn maybe be under axis 2

dtgs831,,CHAT provides free mental health assessment-YMMV though.
dthr8oa,FineFirmament,"I was prescribed 30mg of Prozac for social phobia, but never once did I take a pill. After reviewing medical research with my layman spectacles, I realise that it raises the tendency of suicide by fivefold. Other side effects include loss of libido, weight gain, gyno.

In terms of relieving the myriad of mental symptoms the drug was targeted for, no better than a placebo. 

In my case, I’ve also found that the brain neurotransmitter affected tends towards lower dopamine binding,  instead of serontonin, which the drug or SSRIs are intended for.

I’m looking towards alternative cures/ management. Fasting or eating less seems promising. In a soviet study on the treatment of schizo patients who didn’t respond to conventional treatment, water fasting for 30 days, cured up to 70%. Monitoring long term over a period of 2-10 years showed little relapse, so long as they stuck to the moderate diets and lifestyle prescribed.

demo64b,OmittingCaesar,"Your line of questioning unsatisfactorily conflates a whole host of issues.

Individuals in such situations are deemed to be mentally incapacitated and are deemed to have a diminished sense of responsibility. This means that, at the moment of the crime, the person was unable to understand the nature of his actions, exercise rationality, or even exercise self control, among other things.

The court's determination of the individual's mental capacity is aided by professional medical knowledge and expertise. Is this assessment always clear cut and certain? No; the human psyche remains complex and nebulous. Nonetheless the court's findings are grounded in medical fact.

At any case, it was reported that the Prosecution itself sought a custodial sentence rather than the death penalty. This is indicative that it was not in contention that the defendant was actually mentally incapacitated at the moment of the crime.

As an aside, I would caution all readers to look at news coverage of court cases & legal proceedings discerningly. The news often fails to adequately capture or explain subtle nuances in the law. In cases like this especially, far greater attention is cast on the sensationalist nature of the crime and that may warp our appreciation of the actual issues in contention."
demqqxu,Royallyscrew-ed,"I think the focus should be on rehabilitation and containment rather than punishment, and this should be true for all crimes, but even more so for those committed by the mentally ill. 

The 10 year sentence is more of a deterrent for society than anything else. Of course anyone can claim to be mentally unstable, but if this guy was indeed going through a psychotic episode, his actions were not intentional. The word intention loses meaning when you're in the midst of a psychotic episode. 

Is he a danger to the community? Yes. But consider this: if a man has a tumour pressing on his brain and commits murder because of that, should he be given he same sentence as a ""sane"" criminal? No, because his actions were not his own, it was the tumour that caused him to commit the murder. Were his actions intentional? No. His brain was not functioning properly.  

Let's take another example, let's say you have a disorder that causes you to be violent while asleep. So you go around hitting people while asleep. Now, you have no idea that you're doing this because you're sleeping. Or, you might have some idea, but you feel unable to wake yourself up and stop. What shall we do with you? It's quite clear that your disorder is causing you to act in such ways and you have very little to no control over it. When you wake up in the morning you feel nothing but disgust for yourself. This is not who you are, there's a huge discrepancy between who you are when awake (where you do things with intention) versus when asleep. We can throw you in a jail for 10 years. It might be necessary, but hopefully, when you are there, the focus will be on rehabilitating you. Maybe we can come up with a safety plan for you, maybe we can identify what triggers your disorder. Perhaps you need medication, perhaps you need to ensure that every night someone ties you up before you sleep. Working on a plan is what will keep you and society safe. Throwing you in jail for 10 years won't be any different from throwing you in jail for 20 years.

"
demy86j,dyliecious,"Based on the title you have given this topic your questions seem very loaded. Your thought process also shows you don't really understand mental illness and why its mitigating in this context. 

Theres a bit that goes into psychosis that has probably gone on in this case. Its not just hallucination, its a delusion. Guy probably didn't just see his girlfriend as the devil, he really believed it. Add to that it comes with a fugue state of mind. 

Much like the court will charge children and mentally impaired differently due to their inability to understand what was done, the mental illness defence often relies on that. I think this should tell you what I feel about the first question. 

To answer your second question, short answer yes. Long answer, its situational. Lots of people have mental illness very few end up killing others. Its not something they choose. Without knowing how severe their ailment is, its unfair to push judgement. Example, would you push for a fine if a diabetic was drinking coke on the train? I wouldn't have an opinion on it until I know how bad his diabetes is. That coke could have saved his life, but if not he should be fined like the rest of us. 

As for the sentencing, with point above in mind, its quite clear he was delusional at the time. In his own defence, he does admit to knowing he was killing her, however. He's not making an innocent plea with the mental illness, he's using it in mitigation to reduce the sentencing. I personally feel its a bit long, compared to mediated crimes committed by sane people, but the defence itself asked for that length so, I'd be happy with it. 

Btw mental illness does recur, but is often better managed subsequently. Especially those who are treated. Yes, he would be a danger, but the mental illness would still be a strong mitigation factor for his case. And, yes, it is brief. Meaning to say didn't last long enough to classify as chronic, usually 3 months. "
demvdzv,,">By the way, after you read the article, I don't understand how it was ""brief"" psychotic disorder, it totally wasn't brief at all.

The duration of a brief psychotic disorder is more than a day and less than a month. Misleading, but technically correct.

>What happens if he repeats the crime again after serving his jail time? Maybe IMH might deserve some benefit of the doubt by being able to suppress his mental illness, but still, there is no absolute way of saying he wouldn't revert after he is released.

It was a gruesome incident, but he did not want to do it. Mental illness is not his fault. Someone dies by being struck by lightning, or crushed by a falling tree, it is an act of nature. There is nothing to blame. Just because he did something terrible, you think its his fault, but its no different from a person being taken away by cancer. If anything, he suffers from the lifetime of guilt that he killed someone, someone whom he loved and who loved him back."

den5lyz,lyrajc,"Of course, I am not person who studies law nor psychiatry. I'm just here to start an open ended discussion on this topic. I do understand that I may not know everything.

I'm not siding with any extreme sides at the moment, but yes, maybe the facts did add up to the courts to give a sentencing like this. I'm not going to fight to give him the death penalty like a normal murder case would result. But I really wonder if 10 years is enough for rehabilitation. I just wonder what would happen if he, touch wood, repeats the crime again after he gets out. Would the news be pushed under the rug to prevent more angering of the society? Or will the media still tap on the chance. I'll move this topic to the thread below yours by /u/Royallyscrew-ed

den5mjs,lyrajc,"Well what you have said really make sense. It was a good example that you gave. I myself wouldn't want to be prosecuted for something that I did not consciously do.

I wonder what would happen if 10 years is deemed not enough to rehabilitate him. What would be the next line of action of the hospital/courts? Would they have the right to keep him longer than the sentence? If they do, does he deserve the right to call a lawyer and fight the extension?"

Well reading the examples given by everyone here had really allowed me to empathize with him. But I guess there is never a way to prove that he is suffering guilt now or not. We will never truly understand another person's thought process, we are all alone in our own unique way. I do believe that he deserved to be at least pardoned a serious sentencing."
denrgd5,MythicalZoan,"I'd like to point out that as it is now, Singapore's prisons do not really focus on rehabilitation. They are mostly for punishment. And even if they were rehabilitative, rehab isn't exactly linear, someone won't necessarily be more rehabilitated after 11 years than 10 years. 10 years, I'd just like to point out, is still a huge portion of a person's life and certainly is enough to change a person. 


I'm not taking a stance about whether 10 years is too long or short as a punishment btw, it's only for the context of rehab. "
denafns,Royallyscrew-ed,"I'm guessing he'll probably be institutionalised if he's still seen as a risk. 

Your worry is that if 10 years will be enough, yes? It seems like part of the worry might have come from the news article itself. Reading about how he gouged out her eyeball can easily give the impression that he's a dangerous monster who deserves to rot in hell. News articles are written this way for a reason -- they feed on our fear, we're naturally structured to respond to sensationalism and that's why it sells. It sells & divides: it creates a ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality because we feel threatened by the presence of such ""monsters"" amongst us.

From what I've read, this guy was simply delusional. Psychiatrists are well equipped to deal with such cases. He truly believed that the woman was possessed. What caused this ""brief psychotic episode""? You're concerned that it might happen again -- and yes, it very well may. But that's what doctors are there for. They can teach patients how to take care of themselves before their episodes escalate. There's often a crisis plan in place for such people. 10 years is more than enough to treat such cases and get them to a place where they are able to function in society. And from what I understand, they often have to adhere to a treatment plan even after they have served their sentence, especially if the doctor deems it necessary. Of course this is assuming they have proper system where patients receive adequate psych treatment in prisons. But I suspect it's probably overcrowded and there may not be enough treatment for all patients, so that could be an issue. But even then, 10 years should be enough. I'm neither a lawyer nor a doctor though, so take what I say with a pinch of salt. 

This would be a far more complex case if he were a psychopath, which from what I've read, he isn't. Psychopaths are harder to rehabilitate. That's when I would question if 10 years would be enough. Psychopaths are excellent at manipulating. There have been cases where they would convince everyone around them that they are completely rehabilitated in order to get out early, and then they would go out and commit the same crime that got them incarcerated. Many psychopaths are functioning members of society, but there are many who are just too dangerous, and these are these are often the people that need to be contained, and again, not because they are monsters, but simply because their brains are wired differently, and for our safety, they need to be locked away.

Stayed up to 3am for a week at office during crunch time and once even reported to client's office at 9am the next day to do UAT. I was doing 5 projects at once and around the time I quit at 6 months, I was the 2nd most experienced person in my role. I had constant heartburn at that job due to stress, stupid clients and lack of sleep.

I'm at a much better place now that pays more than 2 times of what that job offered. I seldom do over time in my 2 years of working here unless absolutely required. I like what I do and I get along well with my colleagues, well mostly anyway.

So now you can see our previous predicaments were pretty similar, on to you.

> Took the first job offer that paid the most right out of uni (banking / consulting etc, don't wish to be too specific). Had a terrible 5-6 months there of late nights and the excessive stress caused me to turn to anti-depressants.

Banking is like this. That's the thing they don't tell you when you apply to the job. I hope you knew it was going to be like this before you signed up for it. It's quite well known that people talk about the magic taxi ride that bankers do.

> I cracked and resigned, telling myself I will take up an ""in-between stress-free"" job somewhere and continue finding something I like. I'm currently working on my ""in-between"" job and applying furiously to every opening I can see.

That's fine. Take it slow and easy. Burnout isn't fun. I basically did nothing for a month when I quit my old job but everything I enjoyed but didn't have the time for. Go hit the gym or run. sleep early and eat properly. Your health is the one thing you'll want to look after while you're working at your ""stress-free"" job.

> In truth, I just have absolutely no idea what I want to do in life. I tailored my entire academic curriculum and internships to pursue the coveted consulting / banking path and everything went out of the windows in <6 months. I felt the ""lost in life"" moment on one 2 am night when I was working on a powerpoint deck and looked to my left and saw my 40 year old boss beside me doing the same. For the life of me, I couldn't picture myself doing the same til 60.

**This** is your biggest problem. And I and no one else in the world can help you with it. You need to know what you want in life or you'll never get it. Maybe you had some ideal that working in banking would be your dream job, ask yourself what part of banking was attractive to you? Or even better, ask yourself what do you find meaningful in life? A job doesn't need to be glamorous or high profile or really easy (or challenging depending on the individual) but in order to sustain an interest and passion for it, it **must be meaningful**.

> Go to work, go home, watch some tv shows and movies, hang out with friends on weekend. I'm single, have no girlfriend and literally spend the day waiting for time to pass. I no longer have any motivation in life and I can't find a single thing that inspires me.

As I said earlier, that's all good. You'll need some time to recover from burnout and take it easy for a bit, but you'll need to give yourself a deadline to get back to reality. And what's wrong with not having a girlfriend? Don't get into a relationship because you miss relationships, get into a relationship because you like someone. and you feel they can bring as much to the relationship as you can.

> The thought of the rat-race makes me nauseous and interacting with my friends (who are fantastic people) reminds me how everyone seemingly has it all together and I'm simply wasting my life away in a pit of emotionless, mindless emptiness.

The rat race is only a race if you make it so. Life is a game and the thing is, everyone decides the ""Win"" conditions by themselves. If you play a game where the goals are determined by the very people you are playing against, that's a sure way to set yourself up for failure. Don't let someone decide how you should live your life. Live your life the way you want to.

Tl;dr: You're burnt out, take a short break, figure out your goals in life and get back in there and kick ass, champ.

I may not reply because I'm going to take flu meds and pass out. Hope you're feeling better :)

I suggest u can join Singapore dating union, or social development network, they have 50% off for the dating events. Also, u can take up short courses at the cc, like singing. U have to try to take baby steps to improve your life. I'm doing so as well, so good luck!"
czgk3oh,shbazjinkens,"I've struggled with this kind of problem before as well - not Singaporean though.  When I go over to visit, I wonder how people can live with their entire life being based around materialism, work and food.  From my perspective, that's overwhelmingly common.  There's got to be more to life than just those things - which is why there's a significant amount of religious fanaticism.

Where I come from we fill time doing our own chores (no inexpensive foreign maids) and working on hobbies.  Some hobbies are very elaborate, I build electronic stuff and my brothers work on car re-builds.  Some hobbies are simple, lots of people play cards with buddies or hang out and watch sports.  I've played guitar for years and that's stress-relief for me, but may cause more stress than relief for people who don't already play.

Your real problem is you don't even know what you enjoy yet.  It's a tough problem to solve, because you need to get out there and try lots of new stuff.  Then the day-to-day drudgery of work becomes less tedious because you have a stress-relief valve.  There's also the option of working doing something you enjoy, but that's even harder and maybe impossible for some."
czg6tyv,Justinchoocy,"Hey, take it easy! 
It's normal that we won't likely stay in our first few jobs (i'm in my 4th job in 7 years of working btw haha) , those usually serve as a wake up call and lets us ask ourselves if we want to spend our career life doing that. 
Don't be too hard on yourself! Comparing yourself with others isn't necessarily helpful. Each of us have different strengths and circumstances that we bring about.

Life isn't all about working (though we may spend alot of time doing so), life is bigger than that!
Find a hobby (I have a newfound hobby in calligraphy and recently found that there's a local community on facebook too!) , pick up skills (I'm picking up coffee brewing haha) , travel, find meaningful activities, read, go to church, etc

As you mentioned that you've been burnt out, take the time to recover. 
Give yourself time to rest and distress. 
Don't worry about being single, focus instead on getting your life back on track first ;)

Each of us have a different idea of success (and unfortunately, sometimes, we allows others to decide it for us).  
If success is defined by how much we earn and how big our homes/cars are, our path is pretty much fixed on earning as much as we can. 
What is success **to you**?

But be aware that middle office or back office jobs in FIs are pretty soul-crushing and mundane and you're not likely to get a lot of job satisfaction in the long run. 

You're only six months into your career so you still have time. But two to three years from now, you are going to have a lot less career flexibility than what you have now so you need to decide fast on what kind of career you want. "
czg5by6,gottaname,"Sounds like you need a hobby. Excercise, Do something creative like cooking, drawing or something. My hobby is in 1/16th R/C tanks, which combines the fun of electronics and model making as well as drawing. I also swim when the weather permits.

The bible phrase ""a man doesn't live by bread alone"" is quite true.

I work in IT an equally bad workplaces with an even worse pay. 

I'm now working in a game/animation studio doing what I like (And what I was trained to do). The pay isn't fantastic but the environment and the work is nice. 

It is said a man on average changes his career 3 times in his life. Maybe you might consider a different direction. It is not unheard of people who have decided to switch paths, its is never too late to do whatever you want to do. A colleague of mine here used to come from investment banking.

Don't bother with finding a love life in singapore. Majority of women are either materialistic or frankly on borderline religious fanaticism, it will take sometime running into the special someone, worry about yourself first before worrying about someone else.

I got out of my funk by going to university open houses with my younger sibling. All those youths and their hopes for their future rly infected me. got me thinking hard about what i like and what i can imagine myself doing for a long time. I eventually found something and now have a goal to work towards. 

I would suggest going for open houses or job fairs just to take a look. Even if u dont plan to go for further studies, it opens your eyes to the career options available and you dont feel so trapped in your current situation. You might even get inspired."

clulwk5,Celwind,"Hello friend,

Let me start off by saying that for someone who is presumably still in secondary school, your articulation is superb and it will serve you well growing up.

Next, let me preface this by saying I do not speak for all Singaporeans in this subreddit. However, allow this 26 year old guy who has gone through the system to share some of his thoughts. 

Having gone through the entire education system (primary -> Secondary -> JC -> Army -> Uni -> Working life) and coming out of it, I would give my arm and a leg if I could turn back the time to my secondary school days. Without a shadow of a doubt, those were THE ABSOLUTE best times of my life. The friendships forged, the times spent, the things learned, the experiences experienced were and still are some of the best till date. Again, this may not apply to everyone but for me and alot of my close friends this sentiment holds true. 

I think what could help is to always remember that life is not about the destination. Life IS the journey to the destination. In Singapore, a common mindset is that we are always PREPARING for something that lies ahead. primary 4-6 preparing for PSLE to get into a good secondary school, sec 3-4 preparing for O-Levels (or N-levels) to get into a good JC (or poly major), JC 1-2 preparing for A levels (or Poly finals) to get into a good university and finally in university preparing for finals to get a good job. Focusing so much for the future, we sometimes forget to just LIVE in the present. 

Enjoy the time you have now. Enjoy the friendships you forge now. LIVE the present and you will find things get easier as you go along. I am not saying to just throw preparations out the window and just do everything on the fly. At the end of the day we MUST have a destination in mind BUT that should not stop us from enjoying the journey there.   "
cluoj9z,jodonoghue,"Not a Singaporean (ang mo - know and love the country), but a Dad who worries about getting the balance right, and a boss who recruits others (software engineers, as it happens).

You are an articulate and focussed student, and have much to be proud of - simply based on the content of this post, which I am sure isn't your best work :-)

If you know the material, supplementary classes and tuition really don't help that much. Drop at least some of those for subjects where you are strong, and keep them for the subjects where you are perhaps less talented. If your parents don't believe you, try pointing them to [this article by the headmaster of one of the top prep schools in the uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10421123/Children-left-exhausted-by-endemic-tutoring-culture.html).

While I would probably point to my University days as the best of my life, your secondary school friendships will be the bedrock of your life. Cultivate and enjoy them.

Find time for things you love - whether sport, art or culture, they will help you to define who you are and what to as you grow.

Learn to use your time well. Negotiate with your parents that if your grades are good and you work hard, you can have some time for yourself.

Singapore is expensive, sure. So are most countries, but in the end most people manage OK. I promise you that a happy and fulfilled life in an HDB in Bishan beats an empty life in Condo above ION any day. Money is only one of many things that matter. People with interests and friends can have a fulfilled life without a wallet full of credit cards

One of the best experiences of my life was backpacking around Asia 10 years ago. It cost me about SDG20 per day

In short: be proud of who you are. Celebrate your achievements, but work hard where you are less strong. Make at least some time for things you love. If you have a strong sense of yourself, are articulate and passionate about something, you will succeed far more than yet another clone with 13 'O' Level at 'A' grade and no understanding of what they have learned.

Good luck."
clulwxb,Brikandbones,"Coming from a uni grad and totally understanding and experiencing what you've described, here's what I have to say:Yeah it's tough, and you will definitely have to deal with it because it's one of the more terrible things that is entrenched in our culture. Most important of all is to never lose that interest in learning because of the workload and stress. Also, always have an end goal, not just finish that assignment and do well in class. If something catches your attention, read up more about it, don't just take it as just another part of the curriculum. It gives meaning behind merely mugging.Dump the tuition if you think it doesn't help. Honestly ask yourself I it is your safety net,  or if the teacher is actually helping you understand how things work, or is he /she just giving you solutions straight without you eve n understanding? I found myself dumping my tuition and bucking up by learning through understanding why back in J1. Never needed tuition again.  Find a cocurricular activity you love, and you will look forward to it at the end of school everyday. Set a specific non marks related goal for youself in school, like aiming to be good in English for example, but instead of through marks as your focus in maybe aiming to get published in a school magazine or something. For me, I always loved art, and my aim wasn't really to be top in art marks wise, but rather top in my dedication and interest in it, such that people would know that I love it. The marks will follow that, and it gives meaning to more than numbers.Honestly free time is a lot about working smart, like paying attention in lectures because it means understanding90% of the content first time through. But at the same time, figure out ways to just enjoy yourself while doing it. Study with friends rather than yourself, it's easier to find the support you need when you are stressed and at the same time it keeps studying from being dreary.Most importantly, it's all in the mind. One day at a time. Life is gonna feel overwhelming if you think so far ahead and of all the things you have to handle. For now, just take it as it goes, one thing at a time. You'll look back and laugh at yourself next time."
cluqbch,phdee,"Hmm. Lots of people have given you great stuff to think about. Some good comments up there. I'm going to try to provide a bit of perspective.

Unlike /u/Celwind, my secondary school days were some of the worst of my life, and JC wasn't far behind. Uni and grad school were some of the best. In secondary school and JC I wasn't a good student, but I did what I needed to scrape my bare ass into NUS (I also scraped my bare ass into JC). School is competitive, yes, but at some point you'll realise (hopefully sooner than later) that you just need to get in. You don't need to be absolutely #1 at everything to get in. Sure, people at or around #1 have more options, get more scholarships, etc. But imagine being 18/19 and trying to figure out which program to apply for that'll set you on the course for the rest of your life. A bit unreasonable, isn't it?

What's the solution to this? What really bugs me about the Singapore system is how irredeemable failure appears to be. Failure is set up to be this end-of-the-world kind of scenario. It's not. What I've learned is, if we fail, we just try again. Or go do something else. Possibly something else that makes you happier than what you thought you wanted. There are uncountable ways of living life. You don't have to do it everybody else's way.

The best thing my parents ever told me when I was younger was ""if all your friends jump off the building you'll go and jump too ah?"" That sentence set me on the most different route I could ever have imagined. By the end of my undergrad when I was preparing to start my MA program my mother asked me why I wanted to study so much, why couldn't I ""be like all my friends and go to MOE and go and teach"". I said, ""ma, when I was a kid you told me, if all my friends jumped off the building, I go and jump also?""

For someone who almost repeated sec 2, almost didn't get into JC, almost repeated J1 (I was actually barred from my sport CCA in J2 because my grades were bad - I had a prime position on the team, and had to give it up for the tourney that year), almost didn't get into NUS.. I have a PhD. It's been a funny little road.

Right now you've got to pay your dues to get where you need to be going. That's your secondary school education at least. But at the same time don't give in to the competitive mentality of having to be #1 if that's killing your lust for life. It's your life. You live it. With all its consequences. Life hasn't been easy (it isn't, it'll never be), but you don't have to run the rat race. You can take yourself out of it."
clur92p,mchspc,"The funny thing about meritocracy and the race to the top is that, at the end of the day you're still going to be working with jerkoffs and people who epitomise the term 'mediocrity'. Even if you become a 'one-percenter' your projects, timelines and life will still be tainted by these people who do sub-par work. 

So why? Why do break your back, staying in school and poring over notes and textbooks? 

The reason why, is because of the ultimate resource you have: willpower. Willpower cannot be bought, but it can be trained, little by little. Think of each and every single time you refused to give up as a milestone in which your willpower was increased over the previous day's. Eventually, you will accrue enough willpower to render you nigh-invulnerable to those who set others back by their ineptitude. Your reservoir of willpower will allow you to push your work and projects through with sheer grit.

And then, there's nothing you can't do."
clulsyu,WalkingBush16,"As a fellow student, yes, school can be unbelievably stressful and the future may look bleak and unappealing. My advice would be to take it one day at a time, worrying incessantly about wether or not a local university will accept you could hurt your grades in the meantime. On the topic of university, what's keeping you in Singapore? If you have the grades it may not be a bad idea to keep your eye on universities abroad. "
clusdov,XephirothUltra,"I'm a Sec 4 student, and O's are about to end in a bit, so I feel that I can probably spare some help for you.

Firstly, please, please, please calm down and find some relax time. I've had friends sink into depression because of stress. My teachers have told me stories of people dropping out of school because of all this pressure. Please don't let this happen to you. Find a hobby, go out with friends, get your mind off school. These school years are going to be the most relaxed years of your life. After this, you're going to have to take care of yourself. No parents to buy you food or pay your utilities, no chance to meet all your friends daily, no chance to randomly waste time with your buddies at the mall or something. Plan your days out. Don't spend your weekends with your face in your textbooks. Ask your friends if they want to chill somewhere. These are supposed to be the best years of your life. Don't throw them out the window.

You said ""So then, what is the point of living my life?"" That's the thing about life. There is no point. We're all going to disappear eventually and everyone has limited time. What you do or I do is not going to matter in the end. Heck, our Earth will end up disappearing eventually. So? Why are you stressing out then? Live your life to the fullest while you can. Have as much fun and happiness as you can get while you can get it. You're a secondary school student. You have plenty of time for this. 

If you worry about something, chances are things will not end well. Do not continue in life assuming things will be bad, because if you keep going down that route, they will turn out as you expected. Look on the bright side of life. 

If I can say 1 last thing to calm you down, it's this. Don't worry about O's. Sure, it's very important, but its difficulty is overestimated by too many people. IMO, this year's O's were easier than the past 5 years, to me at least. If you understand your subjects, pay attention in lessons, do your homework on time, you will **NOT** have trouble. Yes, you will have to study, but you don't have to spend the whole day doing it. I can guarantee you that you have a lot of free time right now, just that you're using it for things that make you stress instead of things that help you relax."

OP, AMA and I'll answer to the best of my ability."
clvl1g0,,"By the time you're halfway through J1/done with the end-of-year promotional examinations (that's if you do decide to go to JC), you won't feel any euphoria after the exams are over, because there'll still be As the next year to deal with, and studying to be done during the Nov-Dec hols. You won't feel indignation either at the tests to be held right after term reopens, just resigned. 

Haha I don't know if this is a too-pessimistic view, but it's the way I'm feeling right now. 

I'll be taking my As next year. I'm also fighting against my parents' insistence on GP tuition and a new math tuition class (they withdrew me from the one I really liked because I've had straight Us this year). I'm tired of feeling like nearly every conversation I have with my family starts or ends with a discussion about my grades. 

I was telling my grandma about the changes in my CCA, and she said not to go next year because I have my As. I said it's not up to me to decide. And before I went to bathe, she talked about how if I get kicked out of JC, i wouldn't be able to go to uni, and I don't know...

My day starts with school, and when I go home, school follows me. I don't really mind the work (I really should work harder), but I mind the endless discussion over the kids' academics at home. 

I feel like my family increasingly defines my person by my grades, and that how I conduct myself academically is how I am as a person, like I'm not myself when I can't be defined in relation to what I do and what I am in school. 

I do want to do well. I understand the drive to do well academically, and it's what I expect of myself as well. But I can't always put my finger on what it is that makes me so mad. 

To OP, hang in there. I can't promise it'll get better, but as so many others have said, treasure the people around you, your friends, find a CCA you enjoy, things you like to do, slow down a bit when you can, and if you can't find time, make time. It's the little things that make life :-)

The dissonance you're experiencing is because you're not doing what you want. You haven't yet reached the stage where you can take ownership of your life, so you're just following a program for now."
cluohca,myrares,"I really don't understand how you spend so much time in school. You can try a more relaxed CCA. personally i have never went for any extra consultations or tuitions. usually i just go home straight to the computer and/or xbox. 

i didn't really study much but still managed to turn out alright. and i copied my homework but i made sure to understand what i was copying (except for english/chinese)

to sum it all up, take it easy. you are looking so far ahead and are messing up your priorities. can you change your cca? don't have consultations? just be positive. 
secondary school was by far the best time of my life. (i didn't stay in school for 12 hours. not even once)"
clupk2y,g00bypl0x,"Hello, 

I'll start off by saying I'm currently studying in NUS, and uh, screw the bullshit that people usually say (just survive sec/JC, chiong and do well, and then it will be all well in uni/poly). Make use of your time now. Make more friends. Do what you love, what you like. Join CCAs that make you feel happy, not just for the stupid piece of paper that shows your CCA achievements. 
I'm proud to say i have enjoyed my sec and JC life. Did pretty ok in sec sch but I fucked up really bad in JC. Managed to save myself just before A's though. It's not the point. Point is to enjoy yourself. It's all about how you think of it. ;) "
clurvrj,Goldenshoe,"Take control of your life, don't blame the system, the country, your parents, the moment in time, whatever, remember that only you decide how u feel."
clus3iq,gawdzillar,"Hi, I think most of us can empathise. It's a pretty stressful environment here in Singapore. Plenty of amazing comments above. To be plenty honest, i think things have been getting worse as time goes by. More and more people are aiming for the standard sg dream: get a degree, get a house, get a car. Our exams are insane (iirc a few years back UK wanted us to lower our standards cos our GCE As were too advanced compared to theirs). 

I graduated JC in 2011 and it was already a pretty hell then. Now i see my juniors and they seem more caught up with supplementaries and school programmes. It is probably all about prioritising. My secondary and JC days were the best of my life so far. I enjoyed my CCA, i made good friends, we screwed around alot. For my school's standard i was mediocre. In sec 1 and 2 i felt bad, but by sec 3 i was owning it. Yup i suck, deal with it. I'm thinking you're in an IP school since no Os, so my advice is cruise where you can. Don't burn out. I buckled down in J2 because As were approaching and I did ok. I'm now doing my undergrad degree so that turned out fine. Another time to chill would be army, probably a different kind of working hard, but definitely a break from studying. My friends all seemed to enjoy it. I had fun until i disrupted, and now still wondering if it was worth it haha. 

Day to day living may seem tough, but have your goals and just work on prioritising again. Not everything is necessary (homework lol. Never did 80% of those). Give yourself a break. I would say choose a CCA you enjoy because then that would be a break at the same time (singaporean efficiency). If not, set aside time everyday to chill or enjoy your hobby. Hopefully your parents aren't the type to stress you. All the best man. "
cluy2z9,grandstream,"As someone who has been two both sides, I was from normal academic stream and I went to a neighborhood secondary school and I was failing my classes. Those time was fun but filled with regrets after my express friends went on with life and I was still stuck in the school. 

Eventually I made it to polytechnic, worked really hard there and now i am doing my masters in the states with full scholarship since undergraduate. 

But during my journey to where I am, I have experienced the same thing you have mentioned. I didn't have time for myself and so much competition and the amount of stress is crazy. 

I think the key is to pace yourself and force yourself to relax. When you feel really stressed up, it's time to chill. It sounds counter intuitive but it's true. Normally you are stressed up because you think there's no time or whatsoever, but the point is you always have time to chill, it's whether you can let yourself go and just relax and recharge then get back to it. 

No one can go on and on forever without burning out. Think about this, you won't fail your subject if you take a day off or two (if you did your work consistently)

Another point is try to have fun whenever and whatever you are doing, like studying in group, build friendship and help each other out! Hang out with your peers and etc! It's all about the balance or how you sneak them in.

Lastly, I feel that working hard is better than just have fun and not making good use of your time(subjective). Regret is the worst thing you can experience, and why it suck is because you can never go back and change it. Trust me on that. 

tldr - Pace yourself to work hard and have fun, it's all about the balance. Do what you value the most, and have no regret! "
clv0flc,motleythings,"I'm not gonna be specific, because it varies from person to person, but I guess the crux would be to find meaning in what you do.

If all else fails, treat what you're doing as a challenge instead of a task. If it's too simple, then find something you're not good at and get better in it. 

Happiness is overrated (not to mention that it only exists now). Meaning, on the other hand, is forever. Learn to see the unseen lessons in what you do. There is always a silver lining, kinda? 

Even a highly stressful environment is good in a way. Stressed out at school and can't cope? It doesn't matter you can still catch up along the way. If it's smooth sailing and you never learn how to cope with stress, imagine what happens if you learn that lesson doing things that matter (in your career, maybe). 

"
clv96il,,"OP, do whatever the fuck you want to do, but take 100% responsibility for it. That's pretty much all life is. Start learning to blame yourself for situations in your life. Blame means responsibility and responsibility means power. It's a fucking rush to have power, I can tell you that. Sure, it's still difficult, but in a totally different way. You are no longer limited by what other people do. It's all up to you. That old lady with all the bags of groceries struggling to climb the stairs? Your responsibility. If she falls, it's your fault for not helping her. So what does one do? Help her, of course. It's the most exhilarating feeling ever to be the one responsible for making things happen.

When you start seeing yourself as an active part of the world instead of just a cog in a machine, I guarantee your quality of life will improve tremendously. It's the attitude that counts."
clvbnth,Spritzes,"Shucks, I remember how sad I was when I found out my timetable in Sec 3. Had to stay in school so much longer for classes and stuff. On top of that, a CCA I dreaded because it was full of incompetent people. 

I wouldn't say PSLE was stressful, but I suppose for some people who have high expectations placed upon themselves (also by others) may feel the strain.... 

I feel at secondary level, the textbook is your ultimate friend in studying. Once you fully grasp the basics and do a few questions under the teacher's guidance, the rest will slowly come to you. If you have questions, write them down or make notes of them. That's when tuition teachers come in handy. To answer things you weren't able to figure out and help you with extra practice. Sadly, I only realized this in Sec4. Wasted a lot of time in tuition before I decided to just start studying myself in JC. 

How do you spend the time during your tuition and consultations, OP? :O 

Don't think I can give much advice otherwise 'coz I'm on a full e-learning program at uni now. (Yay, stay at home everyday!) Doesn't seem like anyone I know is on this kinda program. @_@ Still finding ways to deal with it. 

"
clvc3fv,tjhan,"If it makes you feel any better, it's a million times worse in Korea and China. Japan luckily has eased up a lot, some say too much, and now the kids are quite relaxed there.

In Korea, with prep school and all that, kids reach home at 12 am and THEN start doing homework. It's also a lot harder to get into a fancy good Korean school than RI. 

In China, the competition is just insane, you see how people here complain about PRC scholars outdoing everyone? These are the people who are good but not great in China... 

Anyway, I'll like to share that school life is THE most stressful time of your life. 20-40 is super fucking easy, no one tells you what to do and how. Everyday I play civ 5 and LoL and roll in what my teenage self would consider a bed of cash (but actually average pay la haha). I live alone in a rented hdb with as many pets as I want, and I DONT MOP THE FLOOR REGULARLY NO ONE NAGS. 

The SG education system is actually quite good in terms of managing stress, it sounds like your stress comes more from family and yourself. 

I'll share an anecdote that you may find very odd. I was a student in RJ, everyone outside RJ thinks the place is highly super stressed and competitive. The people who joined RJ from outside the RI/RGS system also felt the same, and were constantly stressed out. But the vast majority of the Raffles people were incredibly chill and couldn't be bothered with competing. It's simply because they have learnt to manage their expectations. We know there are the supermen out there, no point fighting them, just do the best we can and have a happy life. The people who came from outside RI they were used to being number 1 in their schools and hadnt encountered the unbeatable supermen and were stressed over how to continue being number 1. 

So the moral of the story is, manage your expectations if you want to be happy. Unless of course you want to be superman then go ahead and fight hard. And remember, school days are considered the best from pure nostalagia. Days of a working adult are objectively more fun and have a lot more freedom. "
clvin5b,iamloupgarou,"http://assets.ethiopiaid.com/uploads/global/Slide1.JPG

Please count your blessings. you can completely fail school in singapore and still survive. I mean, minimum wage at macdonalds is a luxury compared to what you get in other countries.

we have genius people who pass school and decide academia/rat race is irrelevant.. (and go do porn.. 8) )

"
clvpuw1,sierralab,"as a sec 4 IP student let me give you some perspective. I have gotten rid of my year end exams and Chinese Os and am now doing self reflection at the airport, so this would be a perfect opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you.

""First of all, schooling itself is already a big competition...""

Yes it is, and it is only right that it is that way. A school is a subset of society and so competition is to be expected. The key is how do you manage this presence of competition and not allow it to take over your life. 

""...stereotype about 'neighbourhood schools from the society...'

Honestly I believe those stereotypes are ever so slowly decreasing. It is slow and very subtle but it is happening. I volunteer with an organisation with heavy presence of polytechnic students, ITE students, students from 'neighbourhood' schools. Being an IP ""elite"" student myself, the most valuable friendships that I have made, asides from those within my class and a few within my cohort, are the ones that I have forged with so called 'neighbourhood school' people. being in an elite school everybody is alike. Everybody wants to get the public service commission, go to imperial college london to study medicine, come back and work as a medical researcher earning 200 grand a year (That in itself is a scholarship but it does hold some truth in my opinion). People come from relatively similar family background, have similar goals like I have mentioned, do things similarly etc. I will be frank and say that it is BORING and downright RIDICULOUS. Being in an elite school we are supposed to be leaders, but how are you going to be a leader when everybody around you is the SAME? When you are a leader you lead people from all walks of life, and to be able to do so you have to meet them. I know of, and maintain good friendships with people who are from single parent families, people perceived as 'paikia'/ahlian/ahbeng etc, and it honestly has helped me gain a better perception of society. It has allowed me to empathise with people who may not have been as fortunate as me, to understand them and to help them in any way that I can. So to sum up, I call that stupid stereotype of neighbourhood schools bullshit. Neighbourhood schools are interesting. Yes there are a couple of bad sheep who cannot be corrected, but neighbourhood school students are amongst some of the most wonderful people that I have met. Don't fall into believing that stereotype. It destroys you in the end, and you get a horrendous culture shock when you graduate and move on to society.

""...we spend at least 6-7 hours in school per day. And then we start to add up co-curricular activities, one could easily be spending 11-12 hours in school, twice or thrice a week...""

I say that if you cannot change those circumstances, maybe you can change the way you look at it. I went through a major change in sec 2, when I was dragging a huge pile of baggage (I.e. disciplinary records) about, a not very nice GPA and conduct grade etc. I decided that since there was no way I could just stop schooling and drop out then I might as well change the way that I perceive schooling. I take triple science and I try my best to enjoy each and every subject that I take. Now this may strike you as that ""nerd"" or ""mugger"" stereotype but in the long run it will help you a LOT. Lessons suddenly become much more interesting, when you pay attention to the material being taught, think beyond it, try to make connections between the subjects etc. And to go above and beyond the syllabus, to figure out new things etc etc. It makes those 6-7 hours much, much more bearable, when you try to get yourself interested in the stuff. Case in mind when I hated biology, but I had to take biology as I chose triple science. So I decided to enjoy biology lessons as much as possible. Loooking at wikipedia, doing self research etc. Somehow I find biology really interesting. I chose my JC combi a few weeks ago. I dropped physics for biology.

'...will then be faced with piles of homework which are expected to be done in a short span of time...'

that, unfortunately, yes, affects me a lot as well, and I honestly do not have good advice on that, because I despise homework as well. However I do make the effort o complete things as soon as possible. it is much less stressful and i get to laugh at my friends who are rushing work last minute (no I dont actually do that I am nice). And being interested in the material will help as well.

'...all these things has really been taking its toll on me...'

yes me too. I will be frank with you and say that even though I have put in so much effort to make my school life bearable, this year has been a hectic, crazy, stressful year, now that I am done with my exams I swear I have NEVER been SO bored in the entire year. It is just so weird waking up and having nothing to do. You are not alone, I empathise with you, but I think lessening the stress is something that is possible.

'...lacking time to relax...'

You do have time to relax. Trust me. And if you do  not have time, make time. I am not saying neglect your studies, but do yolo a bit. I will be frank with you and say that I think that at times, homework is not the most important thing.

If you are really too stressed out you can talk to my teacher. My school does a really great job with this as all the teachers have really good relationships with each other and the students, so we are able to manage the homework deadlines and project deadling coordination such that we don't have 21398734593 things due at the same time. Don't worry - if you are stressed out your friends likely are too, so you will have backing. And as long as you make it known in a polite and impartial manner, even if you do not get what you want the teacher will surely have an increased level of respect for you.

'...to get a life, chat with friends, meet up and hang out...'

Make time. sec sch is stressful YES. time for relaxation is little YES. So make the most of what you have, make your days as productive as possible. I like to head down to the study centre opposite my house because for some reason I am ultra productive there. I can't study at home because there are a huge amount of distractions so I don't study at home. Find what works best for you, find ways of doing more things in less time. Productivity is key, not just in school, but when you go into the workforce as well. 

when you get the itme, which I am sure you will at least have SOME time, go do meaninfgul stuff. I spend my time volunteering as a photographer or for ad-hoc events. The charity org in which I volunteer for is the most amazing organisation that I have been part of. It has allowed me to meet many people (see above) and what I have learnt there far surpasses what I have learnt in school - as a team leader of a group of ushers you learn people skills, working on frontline, communication etc etc etc. really valuable skills which dare I say are even more important than grades. Because as a component of society you are expected to interact with society, and you need to be able to deal with people to be able to do as such. You may know the action mechanism behind various biological processes, the exact makeup of the atomic nucleus etc, but those are irrelevant in real life, when you have to survive. Also get a hobby, interest etc - I am a bus enthusiast and I am proud of it, people call me weird but I don't give a shit, I know I have more life than them because they dont even have soemthing to do in their leisure time. It helps to make living life more meaningful and less mundane.

To sum up, live life. don't be a no life. Otherwise life is pointless. I know i sound retarded but it is true. 

If that emotional stress is really taking its toll on your mental health, there is always your teachers. If your teachers dont want to help, there are parents, psychologists, friends etc... people who will be there for you when you need them. Remember, you may be feeling stressed, but the people around you are feeling it too... you are never alone.

"
clvpv60,sierralab,"(...continued)

'....how can i face it when i grow up...'

I think what I have said in the previous sections sum it all up: Do what you love, don't be too materialistic. Aim high and relish competition but do not let number one treasure your life. As long as you can find a balance you will be fine. I am unable to give more appropriate advice because I am still 16, but I think several other posters here have good pointers which you can learn a lot from. 

I say although life is tough, but life is short so live it well!

""...that life lost its meaning for me...""

end of years is approaching right? During your holidays when you are free, I urge you do do something like what I'm doing now. Just pour out all your thoughts, whatever thing that you might be thinking of. I do this yearly, at changi airport, as it is a quiet place and very close knitted to me as an aviation enthusiast (asides from buses I am interested in civil aviation as well). Reflect on what you've accomplished, set clear goals for next year and how you are going to work towards them. Even if you do not achieve them you have tried. I had a set of goals for this year which I achieved only about half, but I am perfectly satisfied and I do not regret one single moment because I know I have tried, and in the process of achieving those goals I have learnt a lot as well. I will be doing up my stuff for next year too - it helps a lot trust me. Set a long term dream for yourself, and intermediate steps that you are going to take to achieve said dream. It doesn't have to be academic related (get A for science get PhD in this subject etc). My ultimate dream is to travel all 6 continents by car. Intermediate goals would be to expose myself to more culture (Travel!), get money (Job), experience (Interests, communication skills etc) bla bla bla. It is up to you what you think you want to achieve in your life. Don't say that life has lost its meaning. Average life expectancy in Singapore is about 80. You are 15. You have 65 years to go. Make full use of that 65 years to achieve your ultimate dream. Don't say that you do n ot think you will get to relax, enjoy, life your life. Think positive. You don't know. The point of your life is to achieve that ultimate dream that you have set for yourself. For me, if I have achieved said dream, I would consider myself success, having lived my life to capacity.



This has been an especially good session for me to voice our my rhoughts too, seeing as we are stuck in the same educaation system and will move on into the same soceity in the near future. What I say may not have been totally irrelevant because I am just saying wahtever pops into my head and I may have digressed a lot, but trust me that this is my most honest thoughts as a student. To summarise, have a dream. Make goals that will get you closer towards your dream. Life live to the fullest, because life is short. you only have so long to achieve your dream. Treasure it. 

would like to end off with a quote by Sarah Louise Delany, American civil rights activist: ""Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet."""

clunrtn,Brine127,"Hi, I appreciate your comment a lot - you've said some things that i've clearly overlooked and should be reflecting about, living the present being one of them. The common mindset you mentioned about preparing for something that lies ahead is true to me too.

In terms of my age though, i indeed am still in secondary school, age fifteen to be exact - i guess being sec 3 is when things starts to get tougher (stepping up in cca, longer lesson time and pressurized to start studying to do well in O level etc), being a major factor as to why i decided to write this post here. 

It's pretty cool to hear from an adult like you, thanks for the comment, i've definitely learnt something today"

clvlvlj,Brine127,"Hi there, just a short little question.. i think many students nowadays have been complaining (or rather facing) the same problems as me - lack of time, too stressful work, too much competitiveness, and the list goes on. 5 years ago (if i am not wrong), during 'your time', was things as difficult as how secondary students nowadays described? Or do you feel like they are exaggerating? Has things became tougher as these years go by or are things really just the same as before?"
clvlvby,tommobile,Ah the old OTHERS HAVE IT WORSE SO BE GRATEFUL
clwb17i,ginger_beer_m,"Relax bro, don't worry too much. Have you found a gf yet? If not, you should ;) Teenage love is a memory that you will treasure when you get older.

Regarding work, just make sure you're skilled and have something to offer to society. Things will tend to sort itself out when the time comes. I recommend this book: http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6. In regard of study, go for the hardest thing you can manage in uni. The idea is to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone.

Also, Singapore is not the whole world. Keep your mind open and don't ignore the possibility of leaving Singapore one day. It is very common for people in larger countries to move around within cities in the same country and experience a different culture etc. In Singapore, this is not possible, so travel and broaden your mind as much as possible.

Finally, fuck the tuition and CCA. Don't do them if you don't want to. In place of tuition, form a study group with your friends. If you wanna do CCA, make sure it's something you enjoy, otherwise you're wasting your time."
clvqpy6,jodonoghue,"There are a few observations I would make. I think this would apply wherever you go.

* Put together a draft itinerary. Work hard on where you want to go and why. Then either throw away half or double your time away. You gain far more of a feeling for a place by just hanging out than by rushing from bus to bus.
* Prefer overland transport to air. Sometimes distance means you will need to fly, but you're in an aluminium tube 9,000 meters above real life.
* Find ways to engage with locals. I bought (in Singapore) a cheap phrasebook for the 8 most common languages in Asia. I am sure that I completely mangled each of the languages in question, but it was great ice breaker. I think that at least trying to say 'please' and 'thank you' in the local language shows respect for local culture.
* All of my best experiences were about people rather than places, and were completely unplanned. Yes, Angkor Wat is awesome and Boracay is probably the most beautiful beach I have ever seen, but consider some of these: instant bonding and laughter with the with the other passengers of a Jeepney while we worked together to change a burst tyre half-way to Sagada. Sitting down with a young (I guess 12yo) postcard vendor in Siem Reap who just wanted to practice some English, and ending up eating with his family. Watching a Sumatran 'bull fight' (where the bulls don't really fight). These were among menu priceless experiences, but you can only experience them if you allow yourself some time, and don't rush everywhere.
* Take sensible care and precaution, but don't be scared of everything. Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth. Hanoi is definitely not as safe, but it's fine if you don't flash your new iPhone and money belt everywhere.
* Even if you can afford it, don't go 5*. I found the SGD10-30 guest-houses were generally clean, safe and full of people you would want to talk to (NB: those prices were over 10 years ago - budget needed probably higher now).
* This will be controversial, but travel alone. I lost count of the number of people who were travelling with Girlfriend/Boyfriend who split up when they wanted to do different things, then spent all their time moping about it. A trip of this type is really a pretty selfish thing anyway, and it works better if you just accept that you want to be able to follow your own path. Satisfying others can be very hard.
* Your itinerary *will* change. You will come to places you want to leave immediately and others where you will want to stay longer.
* (for males only) if you frequent brothels, don't expect respect from the locals. You don't deserve it, and respectable people will stay way from you."
clum6xx,WalkingBush16,Can't argue with that... but a scholarship is not out of the question if one has the grades.
clvn4l0,,"First of all, remember that such descriptors are extremely subjective. So, I can't definitively answer you if things during ""my time"" were as bad as now.

That said, I personally didn't find my academic life stressful, competitive, nor experience any lack of time. However, I'd venture that the situation nowadays is most probably more intense than ""back then"". My reasoning is as follows: If you track the historical records for L1R4/L1R5 aggregates for the JCs/Polys, and the IGP for the university courses, they become more competitive over time. Competitiveness is naturally correlated with stress levels (which influences your perception of how much free time you have).

Think of the bright side though. Competition means that meritocracy is working. Luck aside, you are able to forge your path by your efforts."

Hmm I see. I will definitely take this into consideration if I find myself preparing to do something similar haha. Thanks again :)"
ck9qor2,,"I think I've written about this before on this subreddit but I don't mind repeating myself again.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's while I was one year into National Service. Prior to that diagnosis my parents and I merely assumed that I was a weird kid since my behavior was very similar to my father's, so we *were* weird but not anomalies. I wasn't severely bullied at school though.

But things were different in NS. It was due to my behavior as an Aspie which resulted in me turning into a frequent target of bullying from officers, senior NCOs, NCOs and my fellow NSFs. There was no relief from that bullying and I nearly blew my head off with my rifle. From that point onwards, I was made to seek professional help. But it wasn't as if the bullying stopped. Even though I had a detailed letter from a prolific (retired) military psychiatrist explaining my condition in simple language and wrote out recommendations on dealing with me, many of my superiors accused me of malingering.

Our state propaganda likes to boast that National Service promotes patriotism in us. I'm afraid to say that the NS experience only served to cement my antipathy for this country and steeled my resolve to leave it behind.

I can probably write an entire essay on how I cope and integrate myself into society. Obviously, being with large groups of people is a mentally draining affair for me and I work best in one-on-one discussions, or at most in a gathering of 4 people. Any more and I will just shut down and go silent. In not too many words, in order to make up for my natural lack of empathy for other people, I apply my intellectual side of my mind in imagining how it feels like to be in other person's shoes before proceeding with responses. This ""intellectual side"" is something that everyone should be familiar with - it's that mode you use when you're doing Math in your head, or when you're doing homework. My other method is to construct and employ a mental flowchart that's not very different from the Friendship Algorithm used by Big Bang Theory's Sheldon. It's not a rigid structure, however. If I make a mistake with someone and it results in a social snafu, I don't get too caught up in how badly I fucked up, take it as a lesson learned, adjust that mental flowchart of mine and move on with life. Sure, it might make my social interactions seem insincere when I describe them as a mere function of my flowchart, but this is how I integrate myself with society."

ck9s8ww,,"Hi! I have PMDD and ADHD (now called ADD I believe). 

ADHD is actually pretty well understood/accepted compared to other illnesses. Mine is predominantly inattentive and I'm able to manage it without medication. It's definitely quite difficult to deal with but I think I'm pretty good considering that no one besides my immediate family, doctors, and a close friend know about it.

PMDD is not well understood at all, even by science I imagine. I'm still not sure if it's a mental or physical condition; probably both, since it involves hormones? I was surprised when I was diagnosed with it; everyone in my family suffers from difficult menstruation, but I'm the only one I know of who suffers mentally as well. I don't tell anyone about it because even when I explain, people just assume it's the same as PMS. It is quite different. I can control how I feel during PMS and I can identify what causes me to cry, become angry, etc. with this, I cry for days and days whenever I'm alone and even sometimes in public if it's quite bad and I don't know why I'm crying so I can't stop. Crying so much is physically tiring and after these crying episodes I have to sleep a lot to rest my body and eyes. Crying gets mixed up with anger and this is the worst because anger can be directed at others, unlike sadness, and I don't want my problems to affect anyone else. I've only gotten angry at someone else twice and even though both people said it's ok, I still feel so ashamed of myself for it. This has been happening for the past 5 years but I only got a name for it a few months ago. Unfortunately medication is out of the question as I have tried SSRIs before and they made it worse. Hormonal birth control can make the symptoms better but I have a family history of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers and I would rather not take a chance. So I just deal with it on my own. Exercising a lot (gym in the morning and running at night) helps a lot, as does talking to people I care about NOT face to face as I feel very dead, lose my appetite, unable to smile, etc the whole time this is happening. But neither of them make it go away completely.
My parents know I have it but they don't understand it either, so I stopped telling them how I feel. I've only told a few friends and most don't get it.

ck9vns2,,"Sleep apnea. Some people think that by sleeping early etc etc means you will sleep well and hence has no reason to suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and related health conditions.

I also have PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. Living with this condition means that it's too easy to put on weight and it's 1000% harder (my own estimates) to slim down than the average healthy person. People just see me as a glutton who is too lazy to make herself ""look better"". Whatever health reasons are ""excuses"".

Although the former is true, but I've had so much yo-yo weight over the years (+-20kg) I've gotten sick of the effort required. I just want to eat whatever the fuck I want. I think I am pretty. Most of the time anyway. Full stop.

Before I realized this, I thought I was just lazy/stupid/horrible/crazy in some way, like it was a personality defect and I was just a bad person. After that, I was troubled by the idea that I might have a disorder or be disabled in some way that requires medication or some other form of prosthesis. Now I'm starting to come to terms with it. It does sort of give me certain 'mental superpowers' as a tradeoff. 

So it's a pretty 'good' disorder to have, compared to say bipolar or something worse. It is what it is and I am who I am, I just need to learn to live my life in a way and engineer my environments in a way that is optimized for this.

The outward personality I've built up has become a living, breathing character of his own and most people save for my family and fewer than half a dozen of my closest friends truly know who I am when I don't have the mask on. Do you think a woman would find it fair if I dated her while having that mask on, only to later find out it was a facsimile of *me* all along?

I don't disagree with you on that point. The way I think through it, I ""deceive"" people in my everyday life because my survival as a person in this society depends on it. That's a justifiable *casus deceptio* (case for deception) for me. It no longer becomes justified when I deceive someone just because I want their company and intimacy. I've been deceived before for superficial reasons and it's terrible, and I never want to inflict that on a woman."
ckalvzi,pannerin,"I never posted about that before. But I was diagnosed by some clinician at the age of 13-ish when I stopped going to school. My life has had drama since then that no educationally focused Singaporean parent would have accepted, so I was not informed of my diagnosis until I stopped going to school again a few years later.

Examples are: I have no idea what constitutes mock outrage from others; I just think about how they're totally right and not how they are just joking. I have no filter whatsoever; I can say things that hurt others without meaning to in the first place. (I am not the best person, but I don't like telling others things that hurt them. I then adjust my framework of how to converse, but not before I feel terrible inside.) 

A big thing is that my speech is very uneven. It's difficult for me to compose a full statement in my mind and I often end up clarifying my views as I go along and denouncing the stands that I might have held in the previous sentence. I have no idea how to get out of an awkward situation. I stay there and get manipulated or just shut down and reject any further communication.

I feel like I can switch between analysing the situation I'm in, like at a group outing or at the market, and responding emotionally and sort of living in the now. I prefer observing the group I am in and reacting silently or in exclamations and throwaway lines."
ckaoe6t,pannerin,"> my survival as a person in this society depends on ('deceiving' people)
Many other people also have to 'deceive' others to survive in society. Criminals on the run from the law, rich people who want companions who see them as themselves, disfigured people who undergo plastic surgery (or simply people who wear makeup), queer people pressured to seem normative, and people with emotional trauma that they want to move on from but can never forget. 

Maybe such examples don't convince you that 'deception' is ok in certain situations. I know I can do much better in arguing my case and these examples may suck, but I'm sure that there would be an example, an exception to your rule that you can accept as a legitimate 'deception'.

> 'I've been deceived before for superficial reasons and it's terrible'
> '(deceiving) someone just because I want their company and intimacy (is not justifiable)'

You may have Aspergers, but you still have social needs, and you deserve to have your needs fulfilled just like you are entitled to human rights. This is not a superficial need. And this goes beyond interaction with others; the ASMR from a soothing conversation and the fulfilment of the need for intimate skin-to-skin contact are nice things that everyone should ideally get to experience on a regular basis. 

The latter is particularly important. Hug machines and no-strings-attached cuddle partners could be options to consider. Some may also let their false front down during cuddling to their cuddle partners. If the relationship progresses in such a situation, would there still be 'deception' in your opinion? Maybe this is a possibility of how one could grow a relationship with someone else without 'deception' - skip to the physical intimacy and let things go from there. Both of them would know something is up for the other to seek cuddling partners, so they won't be so surprised if the reason comes up.

If you are not convinced that 'deception' is not deception but a legitimate survival technique (well you do think it is a survival technique) and you don't think that there can be a natural way to shed the 'deception', maybe you could change your standards for a good relationship. Not everyone is looking for a relationship built on trust, communication and openness. Successful relationships that don't successfully incorporate all these components exist. 

This may not even be romantic; many people are just looking for friends that have their back. It doesn't really matter whether you are 'real' to them - you always got their back, and in return they have yours. That would be as real as friendships get. Then you can reveal your 'deception'. (like how gay people come out) Then maybe friends could be become something more.

I'm sorry if I failed to convince you. I am young and inexperienced at this. You could receive better advice that would convince you from someone else. Perhaps that may at least let you acknowledge that your stand is not immutable."
ckauuap,,Are there people that you can really hang out with and they'll make you laugh and stuff like that?
ckbfe4e,pannerin,"Yeah, most people I meet. Different people have different personalities, and though people who seem like perfect matches to me have been really rare, I enjoy identifying with the things I have in common with people I know. There's a bro, a flamer, a nerd, a baby snark, an art school kid, a beng in me - I just bring out the sides of me I have in common with the people I'm with, enjoy letting those sides hang out and mix with the sides others choose to bring out then. 

There are a lot of chill people, manic pixie dream girls and just generally positive and accepting people around. Even the cynical and negative people are tempered with snark. I just try to enjoy what is around me.

But I always worry I seem too easygoing with others and have no real substance with others. I prefer to observe like an involved voyeur into teenage anthropology, and I think I seem aloof because of that. 

Because I am a very liberal person people do seek my advice and they do seem comforted by what I have to say. But the statistics on acceptance of homosexuality locally convinces me to remain closeted to everyone I know. As a result of hiding an important aspect of my life to others I don't feel close to anyone. I feel bad when I think people seem to think they are really good friends with them, because I don't feel the same. And with Christians and Muslims I always feel fearful and threatened in the back of my head due to their commonly held beliefs, so that's not really conducive for making friends!

And I am a perfectionist with terrible study habits, so I give up easily on my studies. With all these feelings of inadequacy and fakeness I decided  many times that my friends are better off without me, so I just let it drift away. So currently I have... no friends!"
ckdh4ie,,Thanks for the reply man. It does provide good insight into someone with Asperger's. The only one I know is fictional!
ckdnqda,pannerin,"Asperger's has its flaws as a diagnosis, though. We don't understand autism well enough. I think Asperger's lets us recognise people who seem to fall on the spectrum but sometimes may not fully meet the criteria of autism. 

I recently met someone else with Asperger's who is, bluntly speaking, much worse off then me. Maybe a young diagnosis meant that his case was immediately apparent. But he is very needy now, always seeking approval and unable to accept his flaws. Maybe emotional trauma contributed, but we don't know. Asperger's is a condition lived in many different ways.

Ooh what source is it from? I only read marcelo in the real world when I was looking for YA with Asperger's. Not bad and an appropriate representation, but some didn't like how hot Marcelo was and the privilege he had in general."

• Got pinned down and punched in the body by a school councillor (aka prefect) while I was queuing up for food because I tapped on his shoulder to say hi.

• Got my stationery stolen for ""fun"" and never got them back.

• Bitch of a classmate refused to let me contribute to the project and then claimed that I didn't do anything. Seriously, how did our school choose these student councillors?

• I had extreme self-esteem issues (from bullying) so my heart rate would increase rapidly whenever I have to speak within a group and stuttering was an issue. That was why I was a quiet person. One day, I tried to contribute to the class discussion. Some punk told me ""stop talking and don't be an attention seeker"". I stayed quiet for the entire year.

• Secondary 2 adventure camp instructor mocked me having issues while carrying one side of the boat, all this time while comparing me to this bigger sized girl. Emasculation was horrible.

When I confronted them in the next period (recess) outside class they denied everything and started forming a circle around me calling me names and shit. When I started to cry, guess they got bolder and tried snatching my lunch money too. When I pushed back and started throwing punches, they scattered. I really wanted my stuff back and went to look for them. When I found them, they threatened to ""tell teacher"" if I hit them, which I did anyway and our teacher got to know and so did the principal. My mum got called in. I told them the whole story which they still denied and asked us to check their bags/tables to prove it. We couldn't find anything on them as they had thrown away somewhere around the school. Turns out they also couldn't remember where they'd hidden the stash (perhaps someone else found them). Needless to say I didn't get any of my stuff back. I didn't get to have my revenge or anything like that, it was close to the exams so I just stayed away from them. All of them transferred to another school the following year. But I never forgot that day.

"
drupwaf,firewind555,"Kind of a vent here. Need to get this off my chest. May or may not be blinded by rage. TLDR at bottom.

&nbsp;

Prime target for bullying here. Had a temper and probably the strength to beat the shit out of them but relented bc of ""If you hit them you are the one in the wrong"" bullshit argument by teachers and counsellors. Was fat in primary and secondary school and had somewhat low EQ at that time. Name was made fun of and was a classic for them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Primary:**


Got teased for being fat and being in TAF club. Goaded into getting angry because of the tantrums I threw to vent out anger and avoid beating them. Threw tables and chairs. Meet a piece of shit in P6 class who we will refer to as POS who started a fucking crusade of bullying against me. He is the one who started the idea of making fun of my name. Teachers did nothing aside from telling me to ignore them and telling them off.

&nbsp;

Highlights:


* Caused a tantrum after a bad session of teasing in the canteen after one remedial lesson causing from what I heard a few parents to run off with their children scared.


* Got tormented with name calling down a spiral staircase when I pleaded with them to stop and that I just wanted to go home.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Secondary School:**


Turns out POS and many of the classmates I knew went to the same sec school due to affiliation. Bullying escalated to putting staples on my chair, leaving notes and further harassment during recess. Broke lots of tables and chairs in my anger to vent. Spent most of recess time alone or with the few allies I had. In Lower Sec I had this group who teamed up to bully me. Teachers and prefects did jack shit, not even parents calling helped. What's more some of these guys (including POS) are considered star students due to grades/CCA. 

&nbsp;

**Highlights (Lower sec):**


* Grandfather died in Lower Sec. Broke down during a bullying session the day after. Bullies stopped for a while but resumed.

&nbsp;

* Bullies turned a transfer student against me.

&nbsp;

**Upper Sec:**


* POS was in my class in Upper Sec. The crusade continues.

&nbsp;

* Found new and innovative excuse and ways to trigger me. Eg, If I used my pen or compass in a certain manner they would make fun of that. One time we found poo in the dustbin. I had nothing to do with that at all but they decided to connect it to me and make fun of me with that. Etc. 

&nbsp;

* Started a false rumor that I was gay.

&nbsp;

* Found out where I lived and harassed me at my home, the one place I felt relaxed.

&nbsp;

* Snapped at one point and nearly killed one of them with something sharp. Was pried away by a few other classmates who btw, did jack shit to stop them harassing me but did all they could to stop me from killing one of them.

&nbsp;

* Accidentally threw a chair in blind rage at one of my few friends during one of their sessions. Got pulled aside by math teacher afterwards, who consoled me. Revealed that moment where I threw the chair reminded her of why...someone she knew very well got hospitalized and was in tears telling this to me. I vowed to never do something like that again for her sake. Friend forgave me fortunately and just told me to work on my aim. Apologized to the class for this. Bullies didn't care.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tons of other shit and details I can't remember either bc repressed them or plain forgot.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

No more bullying in Poly, bc we all went seperate ways. Lost weight. Calmed down, learnt to control temper. BUT was left with low self-esteem/confidence, was seen by peers as defensive(from what I hear) and interacting with people was awkward. Took me a while (throughout poly) to try and fix that. Still WIP. Small social network after poly due to not being social enough.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

From what I hear the bullies appear to be doing well, in good Uni, some have GF, all have good social circle and tightly knit close friends. Good for them. But fuck them. Fuck them for being able to enjoy their life while I am stuck alone dealing with the consequences of what they did to me. In hindsight I should have maybe punched them hard. Maybe that would have stopped them. Sure I would be suspended or worse. But personally that's better than the hellhole that is my Sec School life. I wonder if all this could have been avoided if I did that. Did I deserve all of what I went through, I don't know. I was immature back then but I never caused any trouble whatsoever, but if there was a reason, they should have just told me outright instead. Fuck bullies.

&nbsp;

TLDR: Was a prime target for bullying in Pri and Sec school. 'Organized group' formed to target me. Diminished social skills as a result. Doing somewhat well now but regrets not striking at them when I should have.

EDIT: Formatting"
druqwo6,bluecheeseplate,"I was bullied in Primary School... by my own damn teacher. Long story below.

Call it tough love, but the way she handled the 'weaker' students in her class still riles me up, so much so that if I could see her today, I'd punch her. She was a tyrannical matriach and while she praised the smarter students, the ones who fell behind were outright called 'idiots' by her. I shit you not, she called us idiots. And when the rest of the class began calling us idiots as well, she just sat there and smiled. The fuck. 

Hell, I remember one time we were doing some math shit on our personal little whiteboards, and we had to write down our train of 'workings' to show how we got to the answer. I had a Math tutor back then who taught me an efficient way of solving that particular equation, which involved skipping a few 'working' steps, and I thought it was so brilliant, I chose to do it his way.

She took one look at my answer, smiled, then accused me of copying another student's work because I was usually the weakest math student, and flatly asked me if 'I thought I was so smart'.

Oho, I'm not even done yet. There was also one incident where she was giving out our textbooks that she kept for us. When it came down to one textbook, there was no name, and two students were still without anything- me and another boy. I was dead on sure it was my book, even though I forgot to paste my name on there, because of the plastic cover with a tear on it. The other boy thought it was his, too, but remembered his doesn't have a cover and told the teacher it was mine.

The teacher didn't believe him and tried to give it to him anyway, and when I loudly insisted it was mine, she relented, all the while telling me that 'God will strike down liars with lightning'. Lady, fuck off.

TL;DR bad primary school teacher.

Edit: I remembered another story! Though it's a lot more pettier than the others. Again, it involved the whiteboards and our working steps. So this time, me and a couple others didn't get the answer right, and she responded by *throwing* the whiteboards. One girl before me, her whiteboard hit the wall and *shattered*. Teacher didn't do anything about it, and the poor girl had to pick up the biggest piece of the remains and continue with her work. Bitch teacher threw mine too, but I got lucky and it kinda slid into the area between the blackboard and the wall.

I'd like to think she's the reason why I hate maths.

i saw this one guy get pinned down onto a bed by a bunch of seniors/juniors and some really alpha senior straddled him and pulled down his pants. then he held his penis by the foreskin and stretched it upwards as far as it could go, and started flicking his dick with his finger while everyone laughed at him. after a few minutes of that he sprayed deodorant on his dick and let him go. that happened to me too, except i got straddled by a less alpha senior so he didn't pull down my pants or touch my dick - he just sprayed dedorant down my underwear.

it was really common for people to get ""popcorn"" on their birthdays. basically, you wake them up at midnight and wish them happy birthday before throwing a blanket over them, turning out the lights and beating the crap out of them. one of my friends was rolled up in the blanket and got thrown onto the lower bunk of a bunk bed. then the seniors took turns running towards the bed, jumping and grabbing onto the railing beside the top bunk to swing towards him and kick him. looked like it hurt pretty bad. luckily my birthday was after the seniors graduated so nothing really happened to me.

this one time, a P6 kid got beaten up this way by people our room (not on his bday though) and he got really pissed off about it and complained to the warden. the warden then showed up and asked us wtf was happening and the kid narrated everything that happened to him. but as he did so the people in my room started poking holes in his story and calling out some really minor inconsistencies (e.g. kid said ""i got beat up by the seniors"" but we usually only refer to sec 4 and above as seniors, and there was only one sec 4 student in the room. everyone else who beat him up was below sec 4) and arguing with him until eventually the warden was convinced that the P6 kid was just lying. so he told the kid to shut up and go to sleep.

this one time i was spreading butter on bread for breakfast, since that was what we were served. i woke up pretty late so i had to use up the last of the butter. some ultra alpha senior came up to me and asked me if there was any butter left and i said no. so he asked me to give him my bread, and i refused. he smiled and kept asking me repeatedly if i was sure. eventually he said ""alright, whatever"" and started walking away. as he walked past me he slapped my hand and my bread fell onto the floor buttered-side down. that was a very heartbreaking moment for me

idk if this is actually bullying, but it was kinda funny. i was playing ludo with 3 other people. one of them was this ultra-religious dude who knew i was atheist and disliked me for it. he would pray to a picture of a goddess in his wallet before every roll, and whine when i rolled a 6 about how i didn't ""deserve"" my luck or something. at one point i rolled a six, followed by four more 6's (we had a rule that let you roll again if you rolled a 6). every time i rolled a six he would get increasingly more angry at me. after my fifth six he snapped and started raging at me for being atheist. he then stood up, kicked the board over and stormed out of the room. the rest of us stared at each other for a moment and started laughing. this is the same dude who took a piss in the sink in the living room at midnight with a friend because he was too scared of the dark to go to the bathroom. to be fair, the place was quite literally pitch black at night and we didn't have phones to light up the way.

we also had a lot of the usual stuff like stealing random stationery, breaking into cupboards/table drawers to steal stuff or read your diaries so they can make fun of you etc, throwing slippers into toilets, pretending to have hidden things you've lost so they can make you do stuff in exchange for getting it back, seniors treating juniors like maids and asking them to wash their clothes etc etc. this is getting kinda long though so i won't include that stuff.

i left the hostel after my first year and moved into an apartment. the head boy of our school was in my school bus and would constantly ask me for my phone to listen to music, even though he had a really nice phone of his own. at first i obliged because he would only listen to a couple of songs but eventually he started hogging it and would basically listen to my phone the entire ride. one day i said ""sorry, i want to listen to some music"" when he asked me for my phone. he tried to convince me otherwise but i wasn't listening so he got mad and started insulting me. then he shut up for a few minutes and i thought i was in the clear. all of a sudden he grabs my phone and my earphones fly out of my ears. he opens the window of the bus and holds my phone out the window, threatening to toss it out if i didn't agree to let him listen to my music. i got really mad, stood up and started screaming at him and then his massive friend grabbed me by the hair to push me back down. eventually the bus aunty (not sure if that's what you guys call her) came over to try and calm us down. the guy holding my phone started talking to her in our native language (which i can barely speak, but i can understand a bit) and tried to convince her that the phone was actually his and that i was trying to steal it from him. i guess he thought i couldn't understand him. i tried to convince her otherwise with my awful mother tongue skills and i think she eventually figured out that the phone was mine. he didn't give it back until the driver stopped the bus and came over to separate us. that was honestly really weird - he was rather nice to me until that moment. oh and literally nothing happened to him afterwards, he graduated without an issue.

oh yeah, i just remembered the student care i went to in primary school (in sg). these two retards tried to roleplay changi prison and would make us kneel down in front of tables while they pulled our shorts down and caned us. they also tried to make us fight each other and poured tea on my shorts while i was eating. fucking weird."
drurful,xanhuilik,"Hmm I've always prided myself on being able to stand up for myself. But hilariously, upon some self reflection, I guess I was bullied in army. I won't state what vocation I was in, but essentially there was a guy who would take the lead in doing the marching songs. He decided to pick on me, by deciding that I was the 'burden', for whatever reason. So he'd basically be singing, ""<my name> <vocation>'s burden"", over and over again. I brushed it off at first, but it got annoying after a while. 

It finally stopped after I confronted him. This happened when we were marching back from the cookhouse to the bunk, and the moment we fell out from marching formation, I ripped off my helmet, flung it to the ground and walked up to him. It was all one fluid motion, with me lifting him up by the collar and basically telling him to fuck off. The rest of the platoon was stunned, because in all honesty, I was always the type that was pretty chill.

He backed off after that. If I were to analyse his actions, I'd say that he was just trying to fit in and the easiest way was to pick on the unassuming guy. That was a couple years ago.

I guess it's his loss, because I'm now in a position where connections matter the most & I'm very much more well off than him. Both financially and network wise. "
druq13f,dxjustice,Bullied in primary school for being the only asian kid. Ended up learning to fight. Bullying stopped. Friends with some of them later on in life. 
drusq61,Pingu_Pig,"I'm quite clumsy and blur at times but used to love sports. 

During primary 3 sports day, I was the second last person on my team and prior to me, we were second place. After the stuff, we were one of the last classes. My whole team got really angry with me (like physically pushed and threaten, scold me etc.) and blamed me for whole thing. 

Ever since that moment, I have a phobia to play or even exercise around other people. It has since been over a decade but writing this event now still brings tears to my eyes. 

Even now, I just feel really inadequate and incapable and always skipped PE (with any reason possible) for the rest of my school life because I felt like I would destroy the team efforts anyways. People always hated that I was a slacker or whatever but in fact, I was very frightened by just going to PE or thought of it. 

Even now, I would go to the gym at really weird timings like mid early afternoon or late at night to avoid people in the gym so that I can run alone in the place. 

To many people, it's a such a crazy small incident but it was really traumatic to me.  I know it's over and stupid but I'm still trying to get over with it .. step by step. 

I kinda forgotten what actually went down during that time but the feelings still feels very alive in my mind. "

druod3p,StrongMadness,"I got bullied throughout my school life, sucks. So here's the chronicles of my experience being bullied.

Primary school:

1. First day of school (P1), trolley bag got kicked by one of my classmates. I retaliated, teacher saw and informed my parents. Forgot what happened to the aggressor, but when I was in P3 I no longer had to interact with him as he bragged about his feats (about maplestory, gang, basketball, etc.) regularly.

2. Tripped on some wire in the classroom, mother tongue classmate mocked me over my carelessness.

3. P3, got bullied by some P6 dude over a basketball, he snatched my basketball so I went to over to ask for it back. He refused, and began to beat me up while the rest of his basketball gang watched. He even smashed the basketball by my torso. Another even shouted at me asking me to go home to my mother, blah blah blah.

4. Played a little game and I scored. Some guy from the opposing team got triggered and smashed my face into the plastic noticeboard pane. Nose bled.

5. P4, some classmate was salty over a football game so he threw rubber bits at me. Small issue, though.

Secondary school:
Some guy (which became my classmate in Sec 3) kept bullying me. In Sec 1 Conversational Malay lessons, he kept throwing stuff at me, teacher did minimal intervention. When we became classmates, things got worse in Sec 4. He was jealous of my effeciency, he started calling me names (which most of the class would subsequently use). His clique (which were also in my class) also called my stuff like fatass and pulled tricks on me. Glad I don't see any of them now.

JC:
Classmate claimed I was gay and began to spread rumors about it. Thing escalated when I scolded for him to shut up when he interrupted one of my conversations in purpose. As fate would have it again, he was in my PW group but we buried the hatchet and bonded because of PW.

One thing I would regret having throughout is the schools' and MOE's silence on their stance of bullying and the failure of witnesses to report said incidents. I will not forget (I do know the identity of the P6 bully) those who treated me as such and refused to even offer the olive branch.

On a side note: I bulied some newcomer in a childcare before and kicked him. The teachers found out and I got destroyed, wrote a written letter depicting the indicent (I hid the letter, should have thrown it out) and got banned from any activities until my behaviour improved."
drumuxz,microtek789,Was bullied in primary school because I was a timid kid. This kid took a marker and drew all over my textbooks... was also subjected to verbal abuse as well.
drus53h,KimJiHoon,"i was fat,short and nerdy! woohoo go figure! all signs pointing at me that says 'bully this boy' lol

Taf club boy, gigi bengkok (refering to my crooked teeth before i did braces), Pui bak.

I think i did mention one incident on r/singapore about my social studies teacher choke hold one of the bully in my class by the neck coz he kick me in the butt while going up the stairs.

Another incident of my Sec 1 classmate who hanged himself due to bullying. hes indian and love indian dance. he got bullied by several bullies who called him names hence he hanged himself in his one room flat. I wished i could help him coz at the time i can relate in a way coz i was bullied too.


"
druu7ve,mamypokopants,"In the army platoon I was posted to, I had a bunkmate who was a good friend but was quite naive and unfortunately, not so bright and prone to be taken advantaged of.

One of the incidents happened during reservist a few years back. We'd just finished outfield (3 days) and I was going to wash my uniform in the toilet when I saw him washing 2 pairs of boots.

I asked him why he'd brought 2 pairs of boots outfield when he said he was helping another platoon mate to wash his. 

Needless to say I got pretty pissed off and grabbed the boots he was washing, walked back to the bunk and threw the wet boots at the guy who was lying on his bed on his phone and blew my top off at him.

Absolutely ridiculous."
drusx6d,nazedarou,"i used to be bullied a bunch back in primary school. there were 2 main culprits and they would mostly just use me to test out their new wrestling moves which they must have seen the night before on WWE.

one of them was a huge indian kid (he was at least 1.5x bigger than me), and the other was a chinese guy who was a big fan of gorillaz. 

i remember the time i figured out that making fun of the gorillaz guy's jaw would really get to him. it was like discovering kryptonite against superman. it was **super effective**. he had this jaw abnormality which meant the upper half was always protruding and he couldn't close his mouth properly. naturally, this meant that i would get bullied harder, but man did it feel good to know i could get to one of them. 

eventually, it must have gotten too much for him at some point and he just broke down crying after one of my occasional jabs at his jaw. 

we ended up having this mutual understanding where he would stop using me as a punching bag and i would stop poking fun at his insecurity. the indian kid never let up, though. fucking cunt."
druq9zq,CheeseCakeHaven21,"I had tons of encounters with bullies back in Secondary school.

I entered Secondary school as a brace-faced girl. And everyone would make fun of my braces because I would ""talk funny"". I was the typical indian student with my 2 braids, centre parted hair. Boys would make fun because my skirt was always below my knees or that I would have hairy legs. Eventually I found company with other indian girls who shared the same fate as me. 

I just kept telling myself I had to endure a few more years before I would go to different schools from them. "
drunujy,,"When i was 12, i got a fall and fractured both of my front tooth. Imagine my 2 front teeth, less half of it each.


In secondary school, from sec 1 to 5, I had to endure name callings like bo gey. Others said that someone shot me and bullet shot my tooth therefore there's a hole.


Some joked that I can drink using a straw without opening my mouth.


Some joked that when i eat, food will fall out.


and so on. 


I've learnt to cope by laughing along but things got so bad I just cried at home ever so often.


Dentist couldnt do anything about it as the nerves inside are still quite ""young"". Need to wait for it to mature first.


Then right before poly, i finally got my crown and my teeth looks ok. However my secondary school years made me very defensive and sensitive. Since then I tried to be more outgoing but oh well. Damage's done."
drur3zj,Calculative,"* In P3,I didn’t have any friends and I had a crush on this one guy who I used to be friends with.Everyone called me ‘faeces’ or ‘fugly’ and my ponytail would get pulled by others.One day this girl asked me who my crush was and promised that she wouldn’t tell anyone.I gave in and told her who he was.

The next day,everyone knew who I liked and the guy just stared at me in disgust and they all mocked me for 
months.

In Mandarin class,an annoying girl snatched my pen and she wouldn’t return it to me.It was a very sentimental object to me and I chased her around the class,until she flung the pen against the floor and was like.”Here,you want it?Here you go!”

It broke and I did too,had a breakdown in class.The teacher did notice and forced her to apologize and give me one of her pens as compensations.Of course she was not remorseful and gave me that bitchy look.Everyone laughed at me.


There was another girl who was in my project group and one time I didn’t listen to her nonsense,she stabbed a pen on my hand.Teacher didn’t do anything.

- - -

I hated choir.They were judgmental people who would select specific people of a certain body size(big) to pick on,including the conductor.I was told I couldn’t do anything and spread a false rumour that I bought porn home from the Hong Kong excursion,humiliating me in front of everyone and was told I was ‘blur and fucking stupid and retarded.’

Tried to quit but the teacher in charge and my mom wouldn’t let me.


- - -

When I was in an overseas school excursion trip,someone told me who had planned this bullying and humiliation-it was a girl who I thought was nice and wouldn’t do this to me.

That girl has continued her ways even into Secondary school,a close source tells me.
 
- - -

* Even in Secondary school,I barely have any friends till this day.A guy named Jaden(fake name) stepped on my shoes and food,called me a fat bitch and all sorts of vulgarities and even harassed me on Whatsapp and tried to call me various times.

One time,his friends got around to harassing me in real life by trying to scare me and corner me and throwing rubbish at me-they even recorded this on their phones,yet no one did anything.

- - -

Honestly,this has caused me to be paranoid of who I hang around and not being able to trust people.I have suicidal thoughts and nightmares because of it.I’m trying to cope.
"
druraws,lotuspea,"Fuck I literally remembered something that happened to me in secondary school. 

Some beng called me on my handphone and started asking me about my cup size / why my boobs are so small (I could hear girls laughing in the background) and honesty I have no idea who those people were and why they would even call me.. Got really really upset. 

Edited to add: Also remember 2 younger guys on the school's basketball team would call me flat chested / airport / small neh every time they walked past me.. EVERY time. Till one day I got pissed and said they had small dicks. Don't think it helped though, cuz how would I know right? 

Had self esteem issues for a long long long time. "
drv0x93,kakefumi,"More general post, bear with me.

- I think it really began in p2, after a teacher mistakenly called me out for misbehaving and made me stand in front of the entire cohort. Especially since I was publicly humiliated yet innocent, and not even my 'friends' who knew tried to correct her, I instantly devolved from a optimistic, driven and sociable kid to one withdrawn, scared and scarred who only had video games to confide in.

- from primary 3/4, my score dropped so low that I was in one of the ""bad"" classes. Being the quiet and tiny guy surrounded by delinquents, my stuff goes missing a lot. It also doesnt help that, being a middle child, I cherish everything my parents gave me more than most kids do, and react more emotionally when they get stolen. I remember leaving my bag in the parade square and hiding to catch the bullies red-handed. I did and, of course, confronting them only meant I got beat up. The teachers ofc did nothing about it - they cant be arsed to. I dont even remember how most of my bullying went, except it was prolonged, largely physical, and deleted from my memory. (I think there were some bleeding-in-the-head and punch-in-the-gut occasions too)

Im not sure if I really got over it. I dont really think about it anymore, but when I do, it does open up some scars. And no doubt it factors into who I am now. I am technically doing well, but I am in an ongoing battle with depression, anxiety and self loathing. Funny thing, my chinese teacher in p6 called my parents and advised them to have me checked for mental disorders, and they did nothing! The school had a program to help struggling children with mental disorders, but I wasnt ""severe enough"" and nobody bothered to follow up. Probably my parents were too afraid of the truth and swept it under the carpet.

Please, if your kids or friends are going though bullying, or any kind of emotional ordeal, BE THERE FOR THEM. Having someone by your side will save lives. Conversely, I never confide in my parents for anything, and thats a wonderful family relationship innit!?"
drunx5z,,[deleted]
drur7to,parkel42,"I was bullied in primary and secondary school. I tried to tell my parents once when I was in secondary school, and they basically told me to suck it up. So I stopped seeking help. There was plenty of ostracising, name calling, sometimes it even got physical. I got pushed down the stairs when I was Sec 2 (iirc). 

My self esteem was hit pretty hard I guess. I wasn't very talkative as a kid to begin with, and I just avoided talking at all if I could after secondary school. I still have trouble socialising. And I come off as being defensive most of the time. 

I used to have anger management issues during secondary school/polytechnic, but I can control my anger a lot better now. I would say I still have a pretty short fuse though. "
drurgva,,"Storytime:
-My pencil case got lost in primary school

-Kicked my ankles when walking down the stairs

-I remember there was this incident where a big and burly guy who was very fierce and mean was causing trouble. One day, I think he was chasing after me, (Don't rmb much), so i left my bag in the classroom and went to the principal's office to report it. Think I have PTSD or something.

He had shown much disdain for me, as I was a quiet and goody student. Also, another student spilled water on my table deliberately.

-think it was primary school? Some students thought I was blind and teased me about it.""U blind ah?"" So I acted blind. Eventually, they found out.

-The girls in my primary school spread rumours that I was siao and needed to take psychiatric medication.
Sec school:
-A bucket of water poured over me in sec sch, but I laughed it off. Amazingly, only my face got wet

-Someone who was interested in me hit me on the arm with a flexible curve

-A boy in sec school who would make the spitting sound whenever he walked past me

-Some classmate who I bantered with called me a retard on facebook

-Sitting far behind me, leaving a wide berth between me and other students during assembly

-Some girls from the NT stream, kicked my ankles and when my ear piercing got infected, teased me about it
-Some boys teasing me and calling me their wife and asking me to pole-dance or whatever shit(strangely, I actually liked it.)

That's why my anxiety is so bad, thinking about whether people liked me or not.

Poly: 
-Some girls walked past me, said: ""Hi retard"", laughed and walked off. I was feeling dissociated from reality, so I couldn't process it properly.

-There was this guy, whom I was working with on several group projects. I did not mark him down for the other group projects we were working on, though he did not contribute much. He marked me down on an IT module, and I wasn't good at it then. 

-A girl who laughed when I was doing an impromptu speech for a class. She got D for the particular impromptu speech. She also teased me about me smiling to myself. I was in love then.
I think as you get older, it gets less physical. But more verbal. But it gives you social anxiety."
druxdwi,helzinki,"I was bullied when I was in primary 3. I fought back and the bully became one of my good friends in primary school. We played Wolfenstein 3d together...drew really dumb comics together, robocop having sex was one of our masterpiece.

Unfortunately, we went to different secondary schools and lost touch with each other.

No bullying incidents in secondary, poly or NS.

Hmm...thinking back, I'm surprised I'm not bullied much more considering I was a quiet scrawny goofy looking kid."
druow15,mk_836,"Lmao I got ostracised a lot because I listened to a lot of metal (music was a huge huge thing in lower sec) and I used to get pushed around a lot because I had a fiery temper but was physically super weak (like underweight and couldn't do a pushup with knees on the ground, this was also an all boys school). Remember there was once in sec 2 I wanted a seat in the canteen that a senior put his foot on, so I asked if I could use it and he told me his foot was worth more than my existence. Also had this dude 4 years my senior cyber bully me on Instagram telling me I would never be able to grow out of weakness and stuff (putting it very mildly)

Jokes on them because 6 years later I still listen to a lot of metal and topped the bullies both in grades and in lifting weights

Edit: I've never ""fitted in"" from y1 to y6 lmao. Never fit in with the jocks since my life was ultra kosher, nor the music people because I liked both metal and classical (for lack of a better word) music, nor the muggers since I spent my free time in the gym. Reflecting back, the only major outward changes was learning to control my temper and growing bigger and stronger. Funny how much physical strength/size can be a determinant of social status in an all boys school"
drurnfp,bennnzx,"Don't really think this is as bad as others, but P2 going on to P3, I started growing fat, like super. My classmates whom I thought were my friends slowly started to hang out less and talk less with me. 

Eventually they'd tease me for being the fat kid. Once during a soccer competition between classes, I got pulled out by the best player in my class from the team cause he probably didn't like me. He replaced me with this kid who doesn't even play soccer and during the game stood around chasing after air (not that I was an exceptional player though).

Oh well. Many a times I wonder if these past experiences shaped me in to who I am today.

"
drutt1s,floormudz,"Will just share 2 main stories which happened to me in primary school and sec school. Can't really remembered much, maybe I choose to block them out from my memory. 

Because of my appearance I was a easy target. This has caused major self esteem issues which thankfully got better in the recent years (Maybe because I slowly dgaf)

Primary school: Because I was quiet, one of the bully told other classmates to not talk to me because I was trying to be a goody two shoe to the teacher (Wtf really). 

Was pushed down the stairs but lucky not injured, and this bully liked to fold my worksheets in an ugly way when passing back to me (A big deal for me back then LOL). 

Secondary school: Helped to stand up against someone who was bullied, confided in my form teacher about it. Someone heard me doing so, and began personal attack on me. They went to my blog (blogspot was popz back then), and started leaving hate comments for me. 

According to my other classmates, there was even a chat group open to speak nasty things about me. One of the classmate even printed out one of the blog post which I wrote about some bad things on one of the bullies and then showed it to the class, trying to make me a bully. 

Best part, form teacher didn't give any shit. End up I apologised for the post which I wrote and I deleted it."
druuwtp,SpockySkellintons,"Pri school:

Some malay kid always talk shit about me behind my back and put junk in my bag. I kinda ignored it because it was stupid and rather funny cuz I didnt give a shit and he tried so hard. One day, I went for recess and this NI🅱️🅱️A jacked my country erasers. I was fucking pissed and you know how I found out? He took them out and played with them with some other kid.

Fast forward a few days later he pulled the same shit again. I got really fuckin pissed this time and hatched my plan. A day later he brought his pokemon guidebook (the emerald version one) and showed off in class. Come recess I jacked his guidebook and hid it behind the metal lockers. After recess he looked for it, panicked cuz its missing and told the teach. 

Everyone was subjected to bag check and they eventually found it at the back of the class LOL. Kid was all normal after a day or two. Didnt steal shit from me until the next week.

Kimak this boy steal my neopet erasers this time. I gave up and told the teacher. Dumb kid didnt even try to hide evidence and during bag check she found it in his pencil case. It was returned but i needed to take more revenge.

Kid showed off his shiny registeel star pokayman card in class one day. Everyone was sooooo amazed because its really darn rare so smart me knew what to do. Same routine, went to class during recess, searches his bag for the card, jacked it and place it behind the removable 'display' of my SPI bag. 

No one suspected me because the teach never searched my bag properly and thoroughly and didnt find it. The kid probably knew I jacked his card but he couldnt do shit cuz I left no evidence. He cried for the whole day and never stole my stuff ever again.

Sec school: 

Sec one and two our class was really tight like even the teachers and us were just like our families kinda tight because we spent 2 years with the same people.

Sec 3 it started. This really pretty girl in the class started dating each and every single guy in the class except 5 guys because we apparently didnt make the 'cut' and I was the next in line as I wasnt as creepy as the other dudes. As someone good with females, I learnt through the grapevine that apparently some chicks think im gay and weird after a particularly animated conversation with that chio bu and some of her bitchy friends.

I was really hurted in my self esteem back then because I keep hearing hurtful things from those bitches. One day, I got to know one of the bitches and she got me to the point where she led me on and took advantage of my kindness only to freaking ghost me one day leaving me with more questions than answers. Total cold treatment.

Then she disappeared from school. I tried contacting her to ask if shes okay but nothing. And then people started linking 1 and 2 together which made me a 'rapist' for the rest of the school year. Even the sec 5 kids laughed and made fun of me when they saw me :'/ 

Sad times man. But when sec 4 came, we started hanging out in smaller more tight groups. I eventually became really close friends with that pretty gurl and another one of her non bitch female friend. Heard the whole story, got some closure and the apology I really needed and moved on. O levels came, we studied together, did stupid shit in CLB and graduated sec school.

Few years down the road, chiobu's friend ghosted me because she had a crush on me and I got a gf. Never saw or heard from her ever again. 

As for the chio bu, I met her parents, knew her more personally and caught up with her 4 years after sec school. She has a fucked up brother but her mom is extremely nice like her. Her personality is really great and shes now more tactful but still living in her own world like kids with parents owning an S Class and a C class do.

NS:

Ya boi was cool with everyone. Sergeants tried fuckin with me over petty shit but I didnt take it like that. I acted like that weird masochist that loves being scolded and it divided the uncool sergeants and people who think im a weird fuck. The fucking went on for a few weeks until I got more people to hear my story and the non-association with the weird fuck stopped happening. 

Apparently I converted a few people to act like a masochist when said SGT tried fuckin with us and he eventually stopped because shit got too weird. It got to a point where everyone in the platoon except for a few dudes who were mentally challenged (really) was converted and fucked with the SGTs mind until he eventually stopped bullying us and abusing his powers.

After POP we had this post POP zouk party where we told him we were just fucking around and its just not him hearing stuff in his head but us and we were all good. He became the coolest sgt around after hearing the stories of people post my batch.
"
drutvff,Yobogod,"Currently serving NS as ST - security trooper. It starts when I fell sick. Around October, I fell really sick, high fever with rashes, took a week MC and afterwards, sinus infection another week of MC. During all of this, my bunk mates, those sleeping with me every time I mount, started dissing on me. Spreading malicious comment about my appearance, make false accusations and scribbling down my initials hoping I die. All because I fell really sick and couldn't mount, they took it personally. From friends turned bullies. I did bring this issue up but they swept it under the rug mostly. Even till this day, some of them ostracize me for it. Lesson learnt.  "
drulz2h,giant-fag,"Apart from usual name calling in school and NS, I wasn't getting bullied that much.

But i did some prominent bullying in neighbourhood playground, tamiya/beyblades area. My younger siblings got bullied first, and being a big bro I stepped in. Hence the bullies become the bullied. We did some pretty nasty things like smashing their toys, throw their bike into the bin, and whack them with water bombs. Parents were called but they can't do shit because we are kids.

My mum also teach us as silbings, we should help out each other. So that works out lol."
drus3hi,,"I think this is considered bullying too.


In primary school, I was peeing in the toilet and my classmate stood beside me to pee. We were not using individual urinals but there was this long pee wall thingy(whatever its called).


Halfway thru my pee, i turned 45 deg to my left and pees on his shoe... just for fun :/


He cried.

drut9c6,laevateinx,"When I was in primary 3, I was paired up with this girl from a popular clique in a Chinese group project. We had a disagreement and she started hating me, which led to most of the class hating me/not talking to me. They would do the most childish thing like give me dirty glances and whisper when I pass by, it might seem stupid now but it really made me paranoid and probably one of the trigger causes of my anxiety. In the same year, I forgot my textbooks under my desk, went back 30 minutes later to find them gone. Figured one of the bullies must have thrown out my books, I never got them back and it was near exam season.

When I was in primary 4 (my luck, seriously) a group of Indian girls kept laughing at my name saying it sounds like 'toilet' in another language (either Tamil or Malay I'm not sure), I got so annoyed I told a teacher and one of them cried lmao"
drutsua,,"i got bullied throughout sec 1 bc a sec 3 senior liked me and we talked etc but there was a group of girls that was super obsessed with him so i was bullied hardcore in school and online - they would call me names and write nasty things about me on facebook, scream my name when they see me in school (??), push me randomly etc. 

got better in sec 2 bc i avoided the dude so the girls wouldnt harass me but they still nitpick with everything i do (i used to blog and gets free stuffs etc LOL) and continued talking shit. had a clique (typical Mean Girls) then they turned on me and started bullying me like the older girls did just bc they didnt like how i buy a bottle of evian every morning (???). 

everything was actually typical xmm drama hahaha and i forgot how things got quieter but ended sec sch life with like 2 good friends and i think thats good enough hehe. "
druuz45,blinkluvie,"not a victim of bullying, but when i visited my primary school during teachers’ day a few months ago i witnessed a boy being bullied. it was an upper pri class (p5/6), and i think the victim had some temper issues, but i’m not sure. all the other boys in the class hurled nasty remarks at him and even kicked him, not wanting to sit near him during the performance. the teacher only intervened when small physical fights broke out and just told them to stop occasionally which of course had no impact. idk what made them so against him but if i were the boy i would’ve felt so sad and absolutely hate school. "
druspbm,Xeleo,"This kinda happened during the later half of BMT?    
Wouldn't really go so far as to call it bully but there was this guy who was helpful to me initially as I suck at physical activities.    
We got along well at first but for some reason, he started to be mean to me, demeaning me at every opportunity and sometimes insulting me in front of others.   
Don't really know what happened for his attitude to take a 180 degree turn. Maybe he got tired of helping me I guess.    
Oh well. "
druxb0w,nyoten,"I have mental issues so I've practically been bullied my whole life. School, NS, uni, adult life. It was worst in school then got better as people matured. Don't feel like describing what happened to me but let's just say that it was enough to give my confused teenage self a very misanthropic and bleak worldview.

It made me very mentally tough though, like once you step out of yourself and look at the situation objectively you'll realize that most people that feel the need to bully others do so out of insecurity or they're just plain sadistic assholes who shouldn't be allowed to have an impact on your life. I almost feel glad that I was bullied; it taught me a lot of valuable life lessons, made me a lot more discerning about people's intentions, how to stand strong in your own beliefs etc."
druyvdv,plumpig,"I was the bully. My mum worked at a childcare centre when I was 5. After my session at a different kindergarten, I would be bussed to mum's centre to have lunch and a nap. 

There was this other little girl a year younger than me who was the daughter of one of the teachers there. Because we were children of existing staff, we weren't subject to the usual timetable of the students there so we pretty much did what we wanted. 

I would hide this girl's stuff - mostly hair bobbles and fancy scented erasers - knowing that her mum *really* hated it when her daughter loses her things. So the mum would scold her daughter for being so careless. 

Then one day, I got caught hiding her crayons. Oh, I must preface this by noting that this was during the early 90s when corporal punishment in schools was common. The teachers were allowed to cane misbehaving students in the bathroom but the rule was that the bathroom door had to be left partially open so that the teacher can't be accused of doing nasties to the child inside. So, I got caught and my mum brought me inside the bathroom, pulled down my pants, and caned me with my bare ass on display to all the other children outside. "
drw4vje,Zelmier,"Got bullied in P4. Was with this group of 3 friends, one of them being my old friend from P3. The main problem comes from the so-called ""ringleader"". As far as possible, my friend tries not to do what the ""ringleader"" asks her to do. At the start, everything was fine, doing stuff that friends normally do like hanging out and all, then it took a  more rebellious turn. Got influenced to copy during Chinese spelling tests, play a fool during class, etc. 

Around near the end of the year, the ""ringleader"" suggested to play truant and submit a ""parents' letter"" with a forged signature. I refused. They started leaving me out, saying that I'm a goody-two-shoes. They even surrounded me and kicked me during recess. Funny shit is that the ""ringleader"" parents had a drink stall in the canteen lol. 

While kicking me they were taunting me to call my brother for help since he was a typical secondary school pai kia then. Mostly it was the verbal abuse and getting left-out on purpose that happened. 

Once, they even squeezed into one bus seat after swimming lessons since the teacher claims that there was a lack of space. Thinking about it now, I shouldn't feel sad about that coz they were being stupid. I got the whole damn seat to myself and they had to squeeze together, one of them was quite big-sized too lmao

Maplestory was a really hot game that time, and this ""ringleader"" hacked into my account and stripped my character of everything lol. 

I did try to tell a trainee teacher posted to my class from NIE, but he just said that we were being naive.

Since my primary school changes class every year, I got into a different class from the ""ringleader"". She did try to continue to disturb me, like tickling me during recess while I was eating noodles. Ended up spitting out the noodles. And I did show that I was pissed. All she did was run away and avoided me for the rest of the year lol. 

Having experienced such bullying myself even though there wasn't physical abuse involved, I had a friend that got constantly name-called and verbally bullied by his group of friends which I was in a band with. They felt that they aren't doing anything wrong. We had this Skype chat, and one day I just asked one of his friends ""Do you think he actually minds the way you guys talk to him sometimes?"" 

The friend said ""He like ok with it leh"", something which kinda triggered me somehow. Those being bullied will show that they are okay usually, but tbh, no one can feel good or feel nothing about someone verbally abusing them. Luckily, this friend listened and said he will try to cut down on the verbal remarks. "

dry8bn8,snowvember,"I always got bullied by boys for being fat.

Primary school:

I went to a girls school and the girls were fine. The bullying came from boys from a mixed school nearby. Bus rides home from school were hell. My bus went the same route as the bus from the mixed school. Whenever our buses stopped beside each other at the traffic light, a group of boys would always point at me and make hand gestures that signified fat/pig/monkey. I cried on the bus a few times and the bus aunty told me to ignore them. It was easier said than done.

Secondary school:

Was good friends with a pretty girl and people kept asking her why she wanted to hang out with an ugly and fat girl like me. 

She used to date a guy from an elite school in Sec 2 and we decided to meet up to study. Her ex bf also brought along his best friend. I was pretty excited because I have never met the boys before and was looking forward. As soon as her ex bf and his friend saw me, they started laughing and whispering to each other. I knew what they were laughing about but tried to ignore it and be friend them. But his friend shouted, “Get away from me you fat ass! Nobody wants to be friends with a fat ass like you.”

My best friend told them to stop being assholes but they continued laughing. She told me to ignore them but I was too scarred by the incident that I decided to head home. Thinking about it today still makes me cry. 

JC wasn’t that bad because everyone was focused on studying so nobody really gave a shit. Plus, I lost weight too. But those incidents left me really awkward around dudes. I still can’t hold a proper conversation with a dude without thinking that they are judging me in some way. "
drzmua5,deityfication,"I'm a German-born Singaporean. Seems unique? I guess, but was taken as an insult during my secondary school phase. When I was Sec 1, I was picked on because I was always the quiet guy in class. Being in a Normal Technical class, the majority of the class were Malay, with a handful of Chinese in the class. I was picked on because I looked nerdy and innocent. During a class in the computer lab, one of my Malay classmate decided to just assault me for no particular reason. I was at my limit and I almost committed murder with a really sharp scissors towards him. But my bloodlust was stopped immediately because the teacher got a hold of me. My country of birth was only made known during Sec 2, as we were required to submit our passports for an overseas trip to Malaysia. My Sec 2 Form Teacher just said, 'Ensure you place your country of birth correctly in the immigration card.' and stared at me. And the entire class knew that I was born in Germany. The most fucked up thing that happened after the trip to Malaysia is that the Malay boys and a number of the Chinese in the class started to call me, 'German Shepherd'. Most of the boys just started to beat me up and just insulted me, calling me a Nazi and such. I just felt that my only safe zone was in my CCA, which was NPCC. The name calling, punches and kicks went on until Sec 4. You may be wondering, why did I not approach any teachers? I did. But to be honest, they were fucking useless in handling my case. They told me to ignore them. How the fuck can I ignore them? Once during Sec 3, I went to the Principal's office to request for a change of school. I just want to get out of this hell. But the Principal just told me to endure for another year and I will be out of here. Well, I can say that my school is just really fucked up regarding bullying. Anyways, after I graduate from Secondary School, I went to ITE. I can just say that ITE was the best time of my life, because I made many friends in class and also CCA. There were times I saw my old secondary school classmates. But I just pretended I didn't know them even if they called me out. It was really 4 years of hell. But I endured this long to enter a happier place in ITE.

TL;DR - German Born Singaporean, Sec Sch Classmates not happy with it, beat me up for it. Entered ITE, got a happy starting there."
drup9or,PlastikSporc,My classmate once snatched my bag from my classroom and ran off to hide it somewhere in the school. I told my form teacher about it and she took quite a while to persuade him to retrieve my bag for me. I managed to get back my bag in the end without incident. This was in primary 4. 
druxlsv,,"Back in secondary school, a lass in my friendship group found out that I was dating a girl, and decided to rope in as many people as she could onto the gossip train. 

I was never physically bullied, but through the grapevine, I learnt that there were conversations over MSN Messenger as to how to ""protect"" selected girls in our group whom I was close with in the event that I might ""fall for them"". Complete and utter bollocks, really. "
drv019c,gummywormriot,"I was a bully. 

From reading the comments, I'd say I'm not the worst of the lot but what I did was pretty fucking terrible. 

I went to an all-girls secondary school. In lower sec, I was a wallflower, but when I got to sec 3, I had become one of the ""popular"" kids. I had lots of friends, held a leadership position, all that jazz. I had a couple of friends who were socially awkward 'losers' who never really fit in with everyone else. 

These people had been nothing but nice to me, and while some of their random remarks and quirks might have been strange, they did not deserve the vitriol that I began to aim at them to ""fit in"" with my ""popular"" friends. I felt like a terrible the whole time, but some malicious part of me felt reassured when my group of friends laughed at a mean comment I made or joined in the trash talking.

Looking back, I guess I did it to fit in and gain the approval of my ""friends"" but honestly, I still feel like shit. "

druvpb9,t_25_t,"I remember being bullied in secondary school, got to the point where I couldn't handle it, and started packing random things disguised as weapons. One such weapon was a couple steel ruler with reenforced pouch to prevent making holes in my school bag.


One day, said bully comes up to me after school, and started his tormenting antics, decided enough was enough, and swiftly delivered a blow to the side of the under rib with the corner of said ruler pouch. Being the reckless kid who had watched one too many young and dangerous vcd's, I even warned him that the next time there will be blood.


Another time I improvised with a pair of pliers, but instead of using the metal end, I used the handles, again delivering a very sharp blow to said bully, this time causing blood. "
drukvk5,penutbutterchocolate,"Unpopular opinion inb4 downvotes

I feel that getting bullied is essential/important because it teaches you things about yourself, you should use that as motivation.

It motivated me to workout. It also sort of taught me to not take things too seriously and chill more."

Wasn't till sec 3 that I'd met a core group of friends that really helped boost my self esteem immensely.

I see racism on a daily basis still, but they're mostly by the racially ignorant rather than the malicious.

It's really sad to see this in schools tho, because social isolation can literally hurt a child. Esp when adults tell you how to deal with it with advise like ""just ignore them""."

drvtzsn,WiisdomTooth,I guess it's kinda common for Indian kids to face racism since young. It kinda stopped after secondary school. There was this Chinese girl who would make fun of my race and all and I'll just laugh it off. Many years later I got to find out that she had a crush on me and I was really confused. I guess she was just teasing and didn't meant it. That's when I realize there's a difference when people really mean it and when they joke around because we are close. I wasn't left out like some of the redditors here. In fact right now in army I'm the only Indian in my platoon and my friends would be at racist at times but I know they got my back when I'm in need of help :)

As an Ex-instructor I feel like I have to let you know that MOE never hired anyone as camp instructors, the company that does the camp will look for instructors.
These instructors are normally N lvl or O level grads who do these camps as part time jobs. Only until 2015 did MOE start to register camp insturctors. It's still a tom dick and harry job but you need to have a clean background and above 18 to do it now.

If we don't understand the nuances of a situation, reckless intervention can do a lot more harm than good.

lower pri, got bullied on the sch bus , some guy just hit me on the way back home in the bus, nth much tbh to think of it now, this continued for a while tho, pri sch life was more or less better after that, had a close friend in p6 but drifted ever since uh

sec sch:
sec 1 was bad i guess, all the popz kid formed cliques in the class, was in the most popular clique in class for awhile but slowly got left out.
after that just became lonely in class, sometimes have to find friends to eat during recess, got tease regularly as well. Had once where my friend spit at me when drinking at the water cooler, spit back at him as well LOL. 
 
sec2 was great however, managed to become social and made friends w quite a few peeps, quite memorable times.

sec3 got better ! got into a new class and made friends w everyone :D, the whole year was fun as the class was quite bonded imo.
but towards end of sec3, liked a close female friend, and apparently during dec hol, she got close to another classmate and started dating. 

sec4: everything started gg haywired, that classmate and his clique was popular in class, managed to turn some friends against me, rmb once had my water bottle hidden at the back of the class during recess or smt 

things all changed once i got into poly , found a group of genuine friends that were hardworking as well, so far the best time i had in all the years of education

> I am an overweight guy 

Start lifting and lose that weight. You are 15 and you are hitting puberty right now. Go lurk over at /r/fitness and absorb everything you can like a sponge. If you need a guiding laser, get access to a gym, look up Starting Strength, monitor your food intake. Stop chugging down canned drinks or fast food. This is not just to address that bullying, this is so that you can become the strongest, fittest version of yourself.

> but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with.
> Many people in my class thought I was a stuck up piece of shit or something to that effect.

You didn't give much information behind the reason why you are so painfully selective. I am going to go ahead and assume that you are currently ahead of your peers in terms of maturity, so a lot of their behavior and conversations simply does not appeal to you. In time, they will (hopefully) catch up with you in terms of maturity. There's no need to alienate others or adopt a holier than thou attitude (inferred from your classmate's perception of you). Have you read the book ""How to win friends and influence people""? If not, go read it. I am not going to go deeper in this regard since information is limited, but my advice is, there's always something to learn from everyone you meet.

> there were the handful of retards that took joy in making my life harder than it was.
> others that thought that repeating my name in weird voices around and behind me would be so fucking hilarious

Guys like them like to throw insults and hopefully get a reaction. Realize that no matter the amount of insults they throw, they are all meaningless UNLESS you start taking those insults to heart. People used to make fun of my name in the past too. I say, go ahead and own the insult. Make fun of yourself, join in on the joke and be less serious all the time. Life is short, make merry and laugh.

> everything else can rightfully fuck off

You are angry right now, I get it. I was frequently balls deep in anger during puberty myself (family issues). What I want to tell you here is a rule of life: PERCEPTION IS REALITY. If you let yourself become a hammer, everything you see will be a nail you itch to hit. Be careful of letting your negative experiences color the glasses you see the world through. If you keep harboring negative thoughts towards your classmates, the conscious mind will start to poison your subconscious mind and you will start adopting a negative mindset unknowingly. Go read up on conscious/subconscious, philosophy, etc during your free-time. 

Realize that there will ALWAYS be idiots in this world and what you are doing now is allowing them to poison you. No matter where you go in life, you can never escape them. Instead, learn to be zen about it and not let them affect you instead. With that said, don't forget to leave time for introspection and reflection. Criticism provides the best avenue and direction for growth.

> Criticism won't be appreciated to an equal extent

This attitude won't serve you well especially in the real world. There's no need to direct the kind of responses you get. The onus is on you to filter out what is useful and relevant and what is just hate language designed to bring you down. When people criticize you (even non-constructive ones), thank them and ask them for pointers on where you can do better next time. Such a statement just paints a holier-than-thou impression of you. Refer to earlier rule of life on perception.

> thanks for taking your time to read my sob story. Advice for a teenager ... would be nice

I am going to be presumptuous and call you out here. (Advice would be **nice**?) If your primary objective is to try and get validation, getting people to hear your sob story and feel bad for you, you need to change this attitude. Realize that you are transitioning into an adult soon. No more mommy or daddy to hold your hand and sayang you. The responsibility is on YOU to shape yourself or improve the environment you operate in. You should be aggressively seeking feedback and be CONSTANTLY IMPROVING. Man up and start TAKING ACTION today!

**TLDR**: Hit the gym, lose weight, read books on EQ.

P.s. Ranting is fine, but make sure that on top of ranting you are planning and taking active steps to address the situation."
crmeqqw,crimsonSoldier,"Coming from a neighbourhood primary school, entering one of the top secondary schools was hell. In secondary 1, my form teacher asked several classmates, explicitly, to be my friend as I was hopelessly isolated. I ended the year scoring a 43% average and the worse performer in my house.

It got better in secondary 3/4 because I got streamed to the class for ""losers"" and everyone was more chilled out there.

Anyway, I deliberately chose the JC that many of my secondary schoolmates didn't like to go to, and I had a blast of a time in JC. Maybe, you shouldn't choose the affiliated JC!"
crmfmaw,how2internet,"Wow, SA is really circling the drain. Anyway, at that age, boys will be boys and will ruthlessly latch on to and pick on those who stand out - kids still lack empathy and are full of insecurities. You happened to be the easiest one of the bunch to tear apart, and unfortunately if you react to it at that age, it sticks. 

Your post sets off some alarm bells though. The fact that people thought you were stuck up, you were selective with company and that you mention ""criticism won't be appreciated"" makes me think you've become too jaded to take on any advice or companionship that might come across to you as even mildly hostile. 

I'd have no qualms about moving on to SAJC. At that age and in the JC environment, you're not going to have many ""bullying"" issues again - Provided you find it in yourself to become slightly more vulnerable and open up again. "

I think I know which school you're in, and it's doubly fucked up because people just let bullying slide there, thinking boys will be boys, but hey, I'm going to tell you one thing: JC will be better. All the namecalling will stop as soon as you get to know your JC homies, and for your own sake, get to know them *fast*. 

Btw, you may want to consider aiming 'higher'. Don't go to your affiliated JC if you want to leave these people behind. Go beyond, go further, leave them in the dust. Jiayou! "

crmjtc3,Crionifer,"It seems to me that you're the 'antagonist' in this story, but refuse to accept it. I say this because

1. It's you against everyone else. Of course, being part of the smaller group doesn't by any means suggest that you're in the wrong, but
2. you appear to believe that you are in some way superior to others, and the tone that you have used is often condescending. Furthermore,
3. you have said yourself that you are 'painfully selective' in who you want to be around with. Yet, you seem to be implying that that shouldn't have the consequence of you being seen as 'a stuck up piece of shit', which to me is simply an attempt to push the blame on to others when it is a problem that is due to your own faults. And lastly,
4. you don't come across as being very receptive to criticism.

What all this points to is an over-sensitive and inflated ego. I'm sorry to have to put it in such a blunt manner, but much what you have shared really does go strongly against yourself. I sympathise with the shit that you've went through, but in my opinion, what happened to you was most likely a result of your own personality and actions. I am not saying this in the sense that you 'deserved' any of that, but rather in that it could have been mitigated had you taken the time to really reflect on your own role in the events that took place rather than directly attributing them cause to those around you."

crms763,,"I am like you. I was both overweight and emotional when I was in secondary school. There were people who teased and taunted me, but I must say it wasn't as bad as how you described your life in school... I guess with the more advanced and convenient technology nowadays (like WhatsApp groups etc), cyberbullying becomes easier too.

The lack of any mention about teachers being involved in your post makes me curious though. Have you ever considered confiding in any of your teachers? I wouldn't want to take the liberty to say that confiding in your teachers will definitely help solve your problems, but I'd like to think that even being able to share your school troubles with a teacher could help make you feel better and perhaps... have the teacher look out for you more often in school.

> I came to realise that I wasn't bad at socialising, I was actually pretty good at it, but I was painfully selective in who I wanted to be around with.

I don't know why you would be *painfully selective* in who you wanted to be around with, but for me back in my secondary school days, I did feel like there was a disconnect in the kind of things my schoolmates and I would usually talk about. Some of my male schoolmates were all about the latest computer games and I just couldn't find the ""airtime"" in those conversations during which I could talk. Perhaps that's the kind of feeling you have too - I'm not sure.

If there's anything you're good at, whether it's an academic subject or a talent you have, ""show"" it (if you're good at math, teach someone in need; if you can sing/dance, join your school's talent search etc and perform) and let people be curious about your strengths. You then earn the respect from your peers. Be participative, join others in what they're doing (as long as they're not doing something illegal/wrong lah) and find common interests.

> I have a pretty uncommon name - uncommon enough to be made into a joke apparently. I even went to the extent of asking my parents to change my goddamn name, but to no avail so far

Before you do anything, **you need to be confident of yourself**, including your name. Unless your name is Jesus Christ or something really weird that causes considerable reduction in the quality of your life, please don't go thinking that changing your name is going to help solve any of your problems. **Your name is merely what identifies you; it doesn't define you or what you do.**

> I started to develop a bad rep within a sizeable chunk cohort, even amongst people that I didn't know personally and vice versa. I don't even know many of these fucking people and they made (and still are making) fun of me for things that I am and things that I'm not.

I don't know if this helps or whether you've done this, but **speaking up** is really important. If you're accused of being or doing something you're not, be strong and say so. If you're getting a bad reputation just because people are spreading untruths about you, speak to a teacher or someone who can help stop gossip.

The most important thing is to find friends in school whom you can trust. It can be only one or a couple of them - just find friends who will stick by you and, better, speak up for you.

For facilities everything is top notch. They've just recently moved to a bigger space and I kid you not, the science lab has an ocean view. OCEAN VIEW. On the 9th floor! Tons of musical instruments for the kids to learn and some of them joined the orchestra that performs for school events.   
They also have a huge football court and are real fans of playing sports. 
&nbsp;
Another event that I really like is the International Day where the kids get to cook their culture's food or perform some tradition. And they have a few plays in a year with live orchestra. They were really good! I don't remember any of our schools having so much culture. 
&nbsp;
I'm pretty close with the teacher I was assisting so she bitched a lot about the school. Politics is unavoidable so I guess there were a lot of passive aggressive bullying among the teachers.   
Their reaching technic is also very different. When my teacher went for an interview at NIE, she was very upbeat and excited and they didn't like it all. Thankfully she didn't get the job because then this international school loves the over-the-top kind of teaching, where rewards are the only motivators, instead of punishment. In fact, it's almost to the extreme where even if the kid is a douchebag, you have to say it in a positive way to the parents. Absolutely no negativity. Parents here are extremely protective. On parent-teacher day I would think all the teachers have fake smiles and say your kid is great and amazing even if they aren't. 
&nbsp; 
The pay is super high. I heard the lowest pay is to the janitor around $3k per month.    
One thing that stuck with me are the kids. When you're not in class and they notice you, they will run up to you and say ""Hi Ms Fenatellie!!!"" and then giggle and run off. "
dncid5h,,"I went to intl schools for 11-12 years but I am in a local jc now so I'll try to compare my current school to those. 

ill probably focus on the last one I attended since its an ib school so I can fairly compare it to jc. around a third of the school were prcs who could barely speak English. we also had a lot of white people from many countries and a few more races. 

IB workload is insane. tons of projects and group work assignments that you have to complete. lots of class presentations too. a 4000 word essay that you have to do a ton of research for - it's like a solo PW except I guess there's no oral presentation or evaluation of material. also you actually have to do the solution you come up with unlike pw where everyone and their grandma decides to do an app and eventually just fakes screenshots and mockups using photoshop. the exams are tough but I think a levels are tougher because ib doesn't really have a tys that you can mug. (as in, they don't constantly force you to grind questions because there aren't many to practice. i guess the lack of a tys would make the actual exams harder to revise for)

Just throwing in a quick example of a few ideas our teachers suggested to my friend and I about PW. we got advice from our IT teachers and one of them suggested that my friend contact one of his old friends who runs a school in kazakhastan to code a website for his school. And he would have to analyze his needs for the website, come up with a way to code it, etc for the project. I can't remember if this was for the IA or the EE, but we have to do both for IB anyway. he also suggested that I work together with vendors at sim lim square to set up displays outside their stores/in the windows to have slideshows to showcase the products they sell. apparently there exists specialized software that you can use to display these slideshows (not powerpoint, idk cuz i never ended up doing it) so i would have to volunteer to set up a PC and install this stuff for them.

my teachers were incredibly nice and fun to listen to. they don't really throw tantrums all the time like local jc teachers and are a lot more calm and collected. I'd they have an issue with you they will probably talk to you after class instead of blowing up at you in class. my math teacher was this old english lady who was really snarky and sarcastic, her classes were always fun. however our physics teacher was kinda crazy and would yell a lot. I didn't take physics but we would occasionally hear him through the walls and us bio kids would pray for our friends beyond the wall. he was a cool guy outside class though. Our IT teachers were geeks and their classes were really fun since they were very passionate about IT and knew a lot about the latest trends and stuff.

facilities are really nice. we had a ""common room"" in the library which was a big old classroom that they emptied out. it had a ton of beanbags and tables and chairs and a sofa. I remember bringing a few extra tables in and having lan parties during lunch with my friends. everyone was forced to buy a Macbook so we didn't have too many games to choose from but luckily cod4 ran on Mac so we would play multiplayer on that. all of our classrooms were air conditioned, a lot of them had random beanbags we could use and some had carpets. it was really comfy. WiFi was slow as fuck during lunch break though. eventually gaming during lunchtime started to become a pretty big issue since it was happening everywhere so the decided to open up this big classroom on the top floor during lunch for people to play games in, so that the rest of the school wouldn't have to deal with us hogging tables to play cod or minecraft which was really popular amongst the younger students. however they also had a teacher there to supervise us (although he literally did nothing tbh) so we decided to stick to the common room so we could swear at each other for camping/dropshotting/spawnkilling/using shotguns etc

cca participation is really important. my main cca was dungeons and dragons (a teacher was the GM) but we could also choose to help out other ccas for CAS hours (like VIA but we need to clock 120 hours to pass ib). I helped out the Minecraft cca with my friend. it was run by one of my teachers. it's actually for the younger kids from like p4 to sec2 but we were allowed to join as helpers. they all played on a single server and we had admin characters so we could fly around and spawn items etc. our job was basically to teleport lost kids back to their friends but we also did fun stuff like changing our movement speed to fly around while dropping sacs of invisible ink on the kids to turn them invisible. in jc I just kinda slacked off in cca and did nothing but in intl schools it's a lot more involved and fun. 

The students are nice but it depends on how you behave. we had one dude who was a little weird and had a thick accent and he got made fun of sometimes. not directly, they would act snarky to him and I'm not sure if he even realised they were making fun of him. but tbh he was a real creep so idk. most of the students there are very accommodating and friendly towards other people, even if you have a weird accent or whatever as long as you're nice and not creepy. lots of very unique people with many different hobbies and back stories since they all come from different countries. whereas in jc everyone just talks about mugging for o levels, playing dota/maple at lan cafés and watching anime/kdramas. nothing wrong with those hobbies since I'm like that too but nobody really stands out here compared to back then. 

(hitting submit now because I'm on 1% battery, will try to add stuff in as i remember them)

classes are a lot slower paced and fun. for example we had to read a book for our English class and we once spent a double period lying on bean bags on the floor watching the movie adaptation of that book on the projector. We also spent a few IT classes watching documentary on AI. It feels a lot less rushed than JC. 

also substance abuse is a lot more common there and they are really chill about it. some of it illegal too.

I recently visited the campus again because I wanted to take pictures of their video editing room (which was a lot more impressive when i used to study there tbh, it got downsized recently but they still had a greenscreen and cameras etc) and apparently they have a 3D printing room now. It has a ton of 3D printers and the teacher showing me around showed me some pokeballs he made and a few other models made by the students. The art rooms are very cool but I didn't go there often. Except this one time when the school decided to get the students to make tiny clay models of themselves (the clay that you use for pottery, not play-doh) so we all had to go there and make mini stick figures of ourselves. They later put them all up for display in the middle of some room which was quite cool.

The community is really nice, and the events they host are awesome. My favourite one was this one time when we hosted a film festival for students from other intl schools across SG, since i participated in that and got $100 lol. It was really fun watching everyone's films and the production value was pretty high. JC events feel really half-assed in comparison - i think it would be really cool if we had some kind of inter-jc film competition but everyone is too busy mugging for a levels so i doubt that would happen."
dnckd14,Hurt_cow,"It's a like a normal school with lower work-loads, More CCA options and far lower grade boundaries because our grades are bounded to the world rather than Singapore.

For the IGCSE our advance classes are at the same level of normal Singapore o-level classes with far lower grade boundaries. A 75% in economics gives you the highest possible grade meaning that cramming in the form found in most local school basically doesn't exist. There are some people that struggle still and have to go to remedial tuition at math-vison centre but by-an large most people do fine without it.

Bullying in the way depicted in tv is basically non-existent but social orcastrism still exists like in all schools, Most people are nice but there is this attitude of unknown privilege and extreme partying that tends to rub me the wrong way.  Teachers are amazing and never seem like they hate teaching or won't help you, they support most of your projects and such.

"
dncnlsm,casualcatthrow,"I’m currently studying in one of the 3 ‘local’ international schools, namely – SJI Intl; ACS Intl: and HCIS. I came from a neighbourhood primary and secondary school so my response would only cover the IB student life. 
These schools are considered more ‘local’ by virtue that more Singaporeans are found in these schools than other international schools and because they are members of the well-established institutions. The reason why I came to an international school despite being a Singaporean was solely to pursue the IB diploma. I was initially aiming to enter the independent schools but fell short of their academic requirements. (Prelims gave me hope by granting me a streak of A1s, but I didn’t study much for actuals cause I got too cocky) And here I am. I am very thankful for my parents who granted me the opportunity to pursue the diploma programme despite only coming from a upper middle income family. 
Academics

**Curriculum**:

In my school, the year 1-4s take the IGSE examinations (which are supposedly easier than Os, never sat for it so I wouldn’t want to speculate here) Upper school refers to those taking the 2 year IB programme. 
Classes: 8am – 4pm (It gets shortened to around 3pm when you’re in year 2, depending on how many free periods you have in your time-table)

Staff: Mostly friendly, although I’ve experienced staff staying for a short as 3 months before leaving the school. For one, my physics teacher was replaced 3 times within the first year. I’m guessing there’s less taboo about quitting a job at a private school than a government one. 
The teachers are a mix of ex-MOE JC teachers and foreign teachers. Not every staff is a Caucasian, in fact, only 2 who I see walking around mostly are Caucasian. The rest are of Chinese or Indian ethnicity.

Classes are held in blocks of 1 hour, with each day covering at least 5 of your 6 chosen subjects. In year 2 you may get more free periods depending on what subjects you took. Every class in held in a classroom (yes, all fully air-conditioned), unlike the lecture-tutorial style of instruction you see in local JCs. Perhaps, this would be the case only for mass lectures during Theory of Knowledge slot because it’s a mandatory subject for all.
There’s a overseas trip to a neighbouring country like Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos in Year 1 too. (CAS stuff) It stands for Creativity, Activity and Service. Basically CIP and CCA with more self-initiative.

**Social Life**
Alright, let’s talk another big part of school life. Friends….
I’m probably the least qualified to speak on this subject because I only have a close circle whom I stick to for lunch and for sharing notes etc. The school is largely split into 2 distinct groups, the PRC students, the Singaporean students and the other nationalities make up a small minority. The PRC students live in the school boarding and are super tight when it comes to social situations. Most of them hardly talk to the Singaporean kids. I’m guessing because of cultural and language barriers, perhaps? Yea, so being in an international school does not automatically make your social circle more international, it really boils down to how much you want to get out of your comfort zone. 

Probably one benefit has been than my conversational Mandarin has improved since I enrolled.

The local students are, as you expect, belonging to higher income brackets. I can probably count only 3 people in year 1 and 2 who live in HDBs (myself included). If you’ve ever read Crazy Rich Asians, it’s about 70% accurate. It might be higher if you get real friendly with them and get to see the full potency of their father’s net worth hahahaha. They’re mostly snobs with no sense of their standing outside of the school. Some of them are so knee-deep in their self-centred fantasy that you’d be wondering if you were living in a teenage sit-com. Even so, there are some nice locals around who are more humble and approachable. 

**Food**
Technically speaking my school has 4 canteens. But most of the international school students go to only 2 of them. One of them is cheaper and better tasting but is further away from the school. It’s not even a decision for me, the cai png and nasi briyani is too good. I always eat at the ‘cheap and good canteen’. Prices at the expensive canteen can range anywhere from 4 to 7 dollars for a plate. 
I spend 3 dollars on average for a super filling meal at the other canteen. 
There’s also a café that sells overpriced snacks, cakes and other tidbits. Not a fan of that either.

**CCA**
Well… If you wanna join a CCAs you gotta pay a fee. Anywhere between $300 to $500 is a good estimate. But that’s probably a drop in the ocean for some of the kids who enrol here. I don’t have a CCA because IB has this CAS component which is sorta a CCA in itself already. There’s all sorts of shit like Indoor Skydiving at Sentosa’s ifly place. I think the yearly fee was like 1K?? Yea but everyone’s ballin’. 

**Facilities**
I’m currently studying in the new building now, it’s pretty cool. Great classrooms and lots of studying corners. The PE stuff is in pretty bad shape tho, the ‘mini-track’ has bumps and cracks which does all sort of magic for your knees when you run on the; the students usually bring their own equipment if they wanna play a certain sport that day etc.
Oh we ‘have’ a swimming pool, but we don’t use it. It’s right next to the school but no one here has dip a single toe into it. :(

I think that’s it, imma go back to studying for now but I’m free to answer any questions yall have!!!
"
dncrgzh,shipmaster1995,"I currently attend German European School Singapore in the IB diploma. Right now my life is just focused on IAs which are basically small research papers for each of your subjects. And I'm also a bit screwed for my 4000 word essay which I do not have sufficient data for.

As far as life outside of school, I just enjoy doing sports and playing dota. A lot of people in international schools go clubbing on weekends but I don't hang with that group. 

Being half Chinese half German I have a mix of Asian friends and white friends. Most of my friends have some German blood because of the school I go to, But there is a good mix of kids from all over. The school is predominantly white European."
dncl83v,ashwinman,"Its pretty fun and laid-back mate. I am studying the  IB curriculum and the workload is quite insane. The students are really friendly and approachable and very social too, even the teachers as well. But there are some exceptions too, for example, we have a really rude chemistry teacher that everyone in the school hates. BTW, I currently study at OFS. "
dndpvdq,forevertired,"From all the posts here, seems like most of the kids in international schools are from fairly wealthy families. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have fit in if I went there. That's even assuming I can even afford the school fees there."
dncl2qb,heil_to_trump,"Currently taking IGCSE in a rather reputable English-Chinese international sch (if you get what I mean)

Workload is rather ok, but I would argue the environment here is better.Unlike local schools, the students here are more diverse and fun to interact with. Additionally, you could talk about international current affairs and most students would know what you are talking about, quite different from local schools, where if you ask a student about international politics, most would have no clue. 

Subjects here are also more diverse, offering econs, business studies, psychology, religious studies, etc. The sciences here are all pure, not combined. In general, some subjects are easier then others, for example, E maths is easier but A maths is harder.

Not to mention the connections you can make here.You have the super rich/ social media ""influenza"" students. Yes, some of them are pure cancer, but the connections might help you in the future. Some of my friends are relatively wealthy, but they still are nice and humble. Those are the people you want to stick close too.

Teachers here are more carefree, seeing that most of them are westerners. They are less stressed then teachers from local schools.Classrooms and sports hall are all air-conditioned, so that's a plus."
dndedhg,minkums,"Went to an international school and it was awesome. 

Did the IB Diploma and the IGCSE while I was there and those programs really helped me prepare for life in uni tbh. The IB was so demanding but still so well rounded (not just focused on academics) that it taught me really good time management skills and how to function outside of just doing well at school. I actually even got credit for some classes in first year uni from the IB that I went straight to second year for some subjects, and when people were freaking out over 5k word essays I was like meh I've done this before in high school. The exams were hard and stressful like all exams are but I didn't feel like we were ever under prepared by teachers or whatever. I was also more aware of other cultures and cultural differences, and it really helps in the workplace etc. deal with differences between people. My experience at an international school has really built me into a 'global citizen', I feel like I can adapt easily to change and live anywhere. 

The classes were very interactive, and the teachers treated you as equals at a young age, which really fostered an environment in which people were not afraid to ask questions and learn. Sports and arts (like drama, music and visual arts) were very highly regarded and encouraged, as well as doing well in the classroom. They would also have cool things like United Nations day with heaps of cultural performances and food stalls selling food of that country. 

In addition, the school I went to recognised that its students were largely from very privileged backgrounds and placed an emphasis on giving back to the community, whether local or international. For example, I volunteered heavily with an organisation which assists foreign domestic workers and construction workers, while friends of mine worked with organisations in Thailand or Vietnam. 

Of course there was a lot of partying and all that on the weekends, but eh that's being a teenager everywhere really. There's also bullying that happens as kids everywhere are assholes but rich kids are even more assholey but it generally gets picked up on and shut down by the teachers very quickly. A lot of rich stuck up people go to international schools but a lot of very nice, humble ones do too. I've made some lifelong friends from high school and they love across the world. The potential for networking globally is massive once you graduate. 

Also I'm sure I've missed something so feel free to ask me anything. "
dnel9a7,silentairninja,"Went to a UK independent school, but most of my life was spent in an international school overseas. I did spend some time back in SG, but here are some things I loved.

Classes were smaller, air-conditioned classrooms were a must and lessons consisted of us making learning quite interactive with the use of laptops. We had a wider range of activities - every student was given the opportunity to shine in any field they chose and they were encouraged to take it to a very high level. In terms of homework, we could choose to type our work up and print it out. 

Since I was boarding (in the UK independent school), it was all these + a really welcoming and inclusive community. We had a couple of ensembles and orchestras in which I participated actively and I also played hockey, touch rugby and swam when I could. Also, Model United Nations was quite popular.

Enjoyed it quite a lot. For a brief year, I did come back to Singapore. Oh hell, the culture shock hit hard. Noped right out of here as quickly as I could and could never be more thankful. Still a proud Singaporean, though. Kudos to you who have made it through the SG system and came out alive. :P 

"
dnci5jo,pendthrowaway,"Went to an international middle school to high school here (I'm American Chinese), never experienced any bullying or fights. Everyone was great. School was on IB program so it was relatively difficult but not stressful. There were parties and we hung out a lot after school doing absolutely nothing (which I imagine local kids will yell blasphemy).

Feel free to ask any more specific questions."

"
dncravi,ashwinman,"In my school, we are allowed to do whatever we want in lunch time (provided that it doesn't disturb other students who wants to do different hobbies) from watching movies to playing games, after the exams, some students even bring video games to school so that the whole class can play, last year, we played halo 5 team death match in school hours after exams and it was pretty lit. My CS teacher also has an apple tv in school, so we watch videos on youtube in class and do other fun shit that we can think off. "

dncihyh,pendthrowaway,Super approachable. All the teachers I had were fun and easy to talk to after/during class. I wasn't a kiss-ass student but I would stay after class to mingle sometimes about schoolwork but often just for fun. It was common practice to have pizza parties at the end of each semester.
dndefvu,minkums,Yeah some even make you call them by their first names. 
dncqhy6,ashwinman,"Only students from kindergarten all the way to grade 10 needs to wear uniforms, senior students in grade 11-12 in high school like me don't have to wear uniforms, instead, they have to wear the school ID. The school also allows students to wear any shoes provided they are not sandals or flip flops. OFS is a pretty spacious school with lots of facilities such as gyms, olympic size swimming pool, playground and rugby fields. The students and the teachers are super friendly and social and it's very easy to mingle with them. Some of the friends that I have made are with teachers because they are pretty cool and have a great personality. The cultural diversity is insane, there are students from over 108 different countries including Singapore as well. As for the academic part, our school offers IB, IGCSE and MYP. I am currently studying the IB and the workload is pretty insane. We have 8 subjects to study which includes 3 higher level subjects, 3 standard level subjects, TOK(theory of knowledge) and PE. The school starts at 9am and finishes at 3:30 pm. The time table for a middle school student and high school student is different. So as a high school student, my daily timetable consists of homebase for 15 mins, 2 subject periods for one hour each until 11:05 am, then its followed by break for 25 mins, and there is two more class periods after break until 1:25pm. Then we have lunch for one hour followed by a last subject period until 3:30pm. The classes are pretty fun and relaxing and there is no pressure on students. The school bus service in the school is really expensive, but luckily, for those who choose to take the public transport instead, the school runs a feeder shuttle bus service from the school to Pasir Ris Mrt for free of cost and its very frequent, meaning that the waiting time for the next shuttle bus is small. Life at OFS is pretty fun as the school emphasises the importance of having a balanced life which consists of spending considerable time on academics, as well as having a social life with friends and family which is really great. The school year consists of 2 semesters, where semester one is from august-december and semester two from janurary-may. We do have two major holidays which is the Christmas holiday for 1 month long in december and the summer holidays for 2 and a half months long from june-july and the first half of august as well.

dncl0je,,"no, it's because i would end up spending 3 years there instead of two if i repeated my first year and they weren't willing to subsidise my third year.

also, for some reason their secondary school goes up till grade 11 instead of stopping at 10. So in that school IB was considered grades 12 and 13."
dndrgy8,,"i don't really know much about them. I think most western international schools probably have the same atmosphere and teaching styles (laid-back, not as restrictive as jc etc). But since GEMS is newer it doesn't really have the same brand reputation as UWCSEA and stuff. They probably won't have as much money either - my school still had stuff like a swimming pool and sports facilities but nowhere near as good as uwc and stuff who have a metric fuckton of cash to spend. but the facilities are still way better than local jcs. However one thing i noticed was that my school didn't have dedicated labs for science practicals - instead my bio/chem classroom had equipment around us that we could use, but we had to do them in groups of 2-3 instead of individually like jc. tbh i'm not sure if IB even has a practical exam, you'll have to look that up, so I don't know if that is a big deal. i'm guessing the top schools will probably have enough apparatus for everyone to work individually but you'll have to ask someone else for info on that, like that guy in this thread who studies in OFS.

The newer schools will have fewer people which leads to a more close-knit environment, if that's your thing. My school only had two classes in grade 12 (IB). Since GEMS is newer I'm assuming it will be similar. However GEMS has been around for a long time in other countries like the middle east, it's just their singapore campus that is new. It seems like they are getting bigger though. Smaller cohorts are also good because it makes it easier to qualify for overseas exchange trips and stuff. in JC you compete with hundreds of students to go on these trips but in my schools it was a lot easier since we had a smaller cohort. 

I honestly don't know much about SAIS, but their facilities seem really good. I doubt the teaching would be any different from the others since they are also an IB school and have western teachers.

I would recommend visiting these schools during an open house day or something and see if they'll give you a tour or let you walk around. My school did that once a year so the others probably do too. My school got students to do the tours rather than teachers so you could probably ask them about their experience at the school for a more honest opinion than what their websites offer."
dnco5jk,lechetea,"UWC does, but it's pretty limited and usually for ""underprivileged"" kids from ""poorer"" countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, etc. and it's very limited. If you really wanted to be in an international school, the easiest way to get in would just be paying the price of your kidney tbh :(

And /u/kerochanscheck is right, UWC is generally hard to get into even for paid students. You'd be put on a waitlist for years even if your parents enrol you in like grade 5 (about 10 years old) and often, the richer trust fund kids (think rich Europeans) just make a ""donation"" to the school to move up the waitlist lmao"

dndfv04,feladirr,"I didn't have a single local friend when I went to an international private school in SG. There were only two Singaporeans in the entire grade so I wouldn't count them, but I never really interacted with non-international school people that were my age.

dndvxjl,potato-stache,"So it's all down to opportunity. I guess it's a good suggestion that teachers from local (and by that I mean neighbourhood schools, not just elite like RI or SAP) and international schools should set up a community for students from both sides can interact and socialise with each other. Perhaps something like weekend football or netball, heritage site visits etc. Singapore is getting more diverse and cosmopolitan at fast rate, about time a contact between the two tribes to happen. Imagine how cool to hear my nephew or niece is going to hang out with their new French and Aussies buddies visiting fort canning and mount faber with the rest of their class.

But I think our stringent education ministry won't allow thing like this ever to happen. All in the name of 'we put our focus on the academic first' or 'we dont want our students to know how the interactive style of education inter schools are'.
I do know during my time, there was this one local band that always reached out to international students. The band is called Summer's Over and they did a lot of gig in Singapore American School in Woodlands there. Last time I heard from them, they have settled down and one migrated to Paris with his French wife."

There's so much one can do than to post 1800-Help numbers. 

For once try to be nice to one another and know that everyone you meet is fighting an unknown battle. And we need to understand the importance of mental health, and that everyone deserves a better quality of life. 

**It's ok** to feel depressed. **It's ok** to feel shitty. These are normal human coping mechs. "
e0dgnw0,kc3s,"A doctor from IMH was once asked how he treats depression. He replied, ""Well, we treat the part that has no depression"". When you focus your thoughts on your depression, all you can see is a broken self. But there's so much more to you as a person than just your illness.

I've a friend who once laid bricks manually to build a wall for his new home. He was a perfectionist, so he attended to every small detail to make sure every brick was prefectly aligned. When he was done, he stood back to admire his work, only to be dismayed that 2 bricks were out of line. He thought it was a terrible wall, and wanted to knock it down. When he showed it to me, I remarked that it's a beautiful wall. ""Are you blind? Didn't you notice the 2 bad bricks?"" he retorted. ""Yes, I did. But I can see the 998 good bricks as well."", I replied.

TS, you're only seeing your 2 bad bricks. Why do u think your GF sticked around? Why do u think there're people here taking the time to reply to an unknown stranger? It's because we can see u beyond your illness. We can see your 998 good bricks. You **are** deserving of love & care. Your illness does not define you."
e0ddrmq,torofrandominit,"Mate, if you need somewhere to vent or someone to talk to, you can PM me. I went through 2 years of that hell myself.

Anyway, think back to the time you got better. Remember that you can get better. That's what I did to give myself at least a sliver of hope when I relapsed. I know it's hard, but it's something I think is worth trying

And have you considered going back to your psychiatrist?"
e0dejr9,,"I can empathize with your situation. I want you to know that depression isnt really something you can get well from. Its not like getting a flu and taking medicine and in 2 \- 3 days you'd be bouncing up and down with joy. Depression for me is like drowning, except you can see everyone around you breathing.

Take all the time you need to heal. You dont have to feel rushed by anyone into getting better.

However as I grew up and travelled more, met more people, worked more jobs. I've seen people who find courage despite taking care of paraplegic children, fighting cancer, paying down medical debts of family members who have cancer... I realise more and more how truly fortunate I was. I didn't want to die. I just didnt want to be in the situation I was in. It helps a lot when you remove yourself from your situation. Id recommend trying to find a job overseas for awhile. A new environment \+ a more independent lifestyle really does wonders.

Also id recommend decluttering your life. I follow one bag living and minimalism."
e0dhd49,zeroX14,"I had 2 bouts of depression before; the first was some 13 years ago and I went through the usual way of psychiatrist with medication but it did not really help me despite trying several types of med. The condition was temporarily suppressed when I got myself really busy with full\-time work, under\-grad studies and sports (though I thought it was a recovery but actually no). The symptoms still showed up over the years and it was actually secretly breeding to become bigger & bigger and it finally exploded in 2016. This time round, I decided to opt for counselling instead and the journey was an intensive 13 months. I could only describe it as a grey cloud that got bigger and denser until it was just choking and swallowing me up. Was discharged in late Nov last year, that grey cloud dissappeared immediately and until today, it has never come back even for a minute. 

So yes, depression can be healed, and fully healed too.

And yes, you are broken but you can be made whole again. You are loved & you can love."
e0dellq,enchantedtotem,"I tell myself if it gets worse I'll have medication. for me talking to someone who doesn't go through the same doesn't help as much as staying away from toxic environment. 

find a coping mechanism, fixate on things that are good and find the good in life. this you'll have to remind yourself often

and never ever run from prescription. there's no shame in it. if you have flu, you eat flu pills. if you have fever you also eat pills. stigma is due to ignorance and acceptance starts from yourselves. let em think what they want.


the world cannot break you.

stay strong.

e0djxd7,Shadow_Vamp,"Resume taking your anti-depressants if it helped in the past, it's a long term approach and needs to be managed, remember there is no true cure for depression. Relapses will happen, and need to be arrested promptly with medication and mindfulness. Some anti-depressants are really powerful, it took me awhile to get the correct one, the psychiatrists sometimes fail to realise that treatment is more of trial and error than a direct science. "
e0dpwjd,Twrd4321,"[And] If you have depression, it’s a liar. It’s a YouTube comment in your head made of feelings that hurt you and slow you. You’re not bothering other people when you reach out, even when it feels like you are. You’re not selfish, even if your brain says that you are. It lies.

e0ev9rz,Lalalanick,"I was bullied in primary and secondary school and also had no friends. My family always scold me for really small things like forget to throw the rubbish and etc. I did not really have anyone to talk to and even though i never go to get check up for depression. But know im older abit and feel better, i know i had it during that period of my life. It was really tiring as a 10 - 16 years old kid  to fear what would happen the next day constantly. I indulged myself in eating as one of my ways to relieve the stress and gained weight and the bullies picked on me even more. I had no energy to study, no hobbies except for gaming because classmates would picked on me when i played some sports with them. I hated the school, hated my home. I spend most of the time in my room playing computer games. It was the worse period of my life. I cried everyday. In the toilet, in the elevator, under my blanket and also cried while using my computer. I did not talk to anyone because i dont feel that i can trust anyone. Im a nice kid who dont do bad things but when my mum lost her money she kept asking if i took it. She kept using police and say that they will catch me and say that if i admit she would not do anything. Its like police interrogating a criminal. (If you admit your crime, we will lighten your sentence those kind of bullshit). My brother would force me to go to church and pinch me if i forgot to do something for him for his facebook games. My dad would shout at me for forgetting to pay the bills for him even though there is 20+ more days before the late payment. I can go on and on about the shitty things that have happened to me and now there are times that i just suddenly remembered them and broke into tears.
Everyone is different. I do not know what anyone have went through and everyone has different ways to feel better. I would say first if something or someone really aggravates you, just stay away from them as much as possible. Find things that you can enjoy alone. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE GOOD OR BAD AT IT. Computer games, fishing, cycling, gym, swimming and so on. Just find something that you feel ok with doing EVEN IF YOU ARE BAD. Doing things that you enjoy a tiny amount at least will stop you from thinking that tiny amount of time which is at least better for you. AND DO NOT HOLD BACK YOUR TEARS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYING WHEN YOUR SAD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYING WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY DONT CARE ABOUT HOW OTHER SEE YOU. WHY THINK ABOUT OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE FEELING UNWELL. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH A GUY CRYING. Take care of yourself before thinking about others opinion. Its ur body ur tears ur life not theirs. Good luck bro. (abit too long hahaha)"
e0eqe42,onetimethrowaway94,"A big thank you to everyone who've reached out to me through this thread, it has helped me a lot. 

To those out there who are still struggling, and afraid of seeking help, please do so. It is not your fault or anyone's fault we are like this, the public judges us but we know we are just souls who need some extra care which is totally fine. There is no shame in requiring extra care. Depression is still a highly stigmatized topic/condition in singapore but just because of that doesn't mean we should ignore it. It is a very serious condition which can affect ones life for a long period of time.

As some replied, when we have a flu or fever we see the doctor and we get better. So why don't we do so for depression? Because of public perception. However does public perception really matter? If They can't see the good in you, do they matter? We are enough and we deserve to be loved, cared and to recover. What I vision for myself is that, one day I will be able to tell people hey, I had depression, so what? I'm now stronger than ever, with more empathy for others because I know how badly it can hurt. If someone is going to judge me for that, I believe that it's their personality that has an issue.

One thing I really hate about our society is that it appears so cold, everyone is just out there to eat each other (which could be the reason why people don't seek help) but I believe that just one person, one person can make a difference. Everyone has their own struggles, are fighting some sort of fight. Just because you are losing doesn't mean you are weak. If I were to put it this way, when we fight a boss in some online games, we seek help if it's tough, we party up. Depression is probably one of the biggest boss I've ever met and would be the hardest one. I've crumbled and failed to defeat him so many times, but it could be because I'm constantly trying to defeat it on my own. So for me, I will party up with those around me, with those that care for me. They stuck with me through this hard times and it's not fair for me to just put them aside. Also, I believe with them, I can finally defeat this monster of mine."

Try this website;

https://www.meetup.com/topics/depression/

Meet with others in your local area who are coping with Depression. From Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) to other types depression, discuss treatment, share advice and support one another.

Have an open mind and try it out, you will be able to relate to these people better than the doctors, your mother or anyone else without depression as it goes without saying that they don't understand how you feel ultimately. This will surely give you more purpose to live as well knowing that you have people you can talk to and a social circle that revolves around your needs.

Famous celebrities such as Ellen Degeneres, Johnny Depp, Eminem, Chris Evans ( Captain America), Lady Gaga and so many more suffered from depression in their early life, some even more severe than you but they certainly didn't choose to give up which is why they made it out and they are influencing people to fight depression now.

I'll be blunt, no afterlife, if you commit suicide, you will never return, stay here, fight depression, change the world.

Good luck.

e0dq6cu,,"One thing many people don't understand about depression is that you can have everything you ever wanted in this world, but still feel so alone and unhappy. OP, you don't have to feel guilty about it. Your family and your gf loves you for who you are, you are more than your depression.

My mind haven't been in the right place for more than 4 years now. The crippling loneliness and countless failures over the last few years has just made me more weary if anything else. It just seems like every time I try so hard, I just falter at the end. I can never get anything right. Nothing is ever going my way.

When I was younger, and I was more carefree, I didn't understand what depression was. I had a table partner in secondary school who had a habit of cutting herself. I tried to help her and be there for her despite not understanding what was wrong with her. But deep inside at that time, I thought it was something that she just needed to ""get over"", a phase of sorts.

Until depression hit me 4 years ago. I can actually remember the exact trigger. It is an inexplicable sadness that hits you when you least expect it to. I can be okay for long stretches of time, and then boom I want to kill myself. There are times where death sounds more like a relief than a thing to fear. When I had the thought of killing myself for the first time, I was terrified. I knew I had a problem but I didn't want to admit to it. I don't want to be labelled as sick or depressed. The few friends I have and my family doesn't know or care. I have never been in a relationship because no one loves me but neither do I have the emotional capacity to love anyone. How can I expect love when I don't know how to love? The idea of an intimate relationship scares the crap out of me. I am envious of people who can have functioning relationships with friends and family. 

Sometimes I do second guess myself and suspect that all I want is attention and that I might just be faking my own depression. My mind just keeps fucking with me. 

I still don't understand depression. I really don't understand how our mind is capable of self\-destructive tendencies when we are supposed to be wired for self preservation. But lately I have been toying with the idea of seeking formal help because I am really sick of self pity and I want to exert some control over my life for once."

Sometimes we need meds to function until we get over the bad part, or sometimes we need maintenance drugs. Your story is very similar to mine man. I can really empathise. I have accepted that it is very hard for me to get off drugs, and some dreams I have to put on hold, while others I can still pursue. ie. maybe part time baking and piano, but idk if I can be an air stewardess or go overseas to study for the time being.

Like you, I decided to stop the meds and have since had difficulty coping. But the side effects from medication were horrible and I'm never going back there. 

I've had the chance to experience both private and public (subsidised) psychiatrists. I can affirm your experience that the ones at public hospitals / polyclinics are crap - basically just don't bother. 

These however are merely my experiences are you have to decide for yourself what you want to do moving ahead. You clearly need help and may want to consider going back on meds. The meds take a few weeks to kick in so don't delay. When was the last time you were on it? Did you stop it abruptly? You're supposed to taper off slowly. 

Many people just don't know how to deal with those with depression. Some just think that it's something you can ""get over"". These are people who've never had to deal with depression in their lives and will never understand. That doesn't mean they don't care. They just don't know how to care.

Please just know that this depressed version of you isn't the real you. The real you is that wonderful person your girlfriend fell in love with. The current you is someone who's been ravaged by this horrible disease and crying for help. 

It is possible to get better. You will get better. Things can only get better from here. You are not alone. Many others have gone through this and are still going through this. Cry for help and attention if you must. But sometimes you have to first tell others how you wish to be helped.

One suggestion is that you seem stressed and need some kind of time out. You may wish to speak to your school about a voluntary suspension on medical grounds and then to start anew when you're ready to."

I think you are just suffering from extreme idealism. Life isn't exactly like what is portrayed in the media. You don't really need a ""purpose"" in life, being alive is a purpose.

Take a look at documentaries and look at how animals survive. What do you think is the their purpose on Earth? What is the purpose of the ant crawling by right now? How about the mosquito about to sting you? 

I think the bigger worry for you is finding your place in society and how other people in society sees you. You are still a student, that part is still far away. Also, you can learn not to care so much about how others view you. Seeking validation from others is always a source of unhappiness. It's ok not to be an amazing person in other people's eyes. Take some time to find out what you want to do to contribute back to society and gain respect from the people. There is absolutely no reason for you to be down, you have so much going on for you ahead of your life. You just need to find a goal to work towards."

e0dh34a,enchantedtotem,"""If only you could be honest with yourself and others, you would be able to fully recover and never relapse again.""

if only it is so simple. mental illness remains heavily stigmatised because people like you and OP's brother makes it seems depression can be solved with a snap of a finger. depression can be triggered by the most random thought in the most unexpected moment, sometimes even medication doesn't work. it's the mysterious workings of our minds which cause us to feel dark and alone and all the negative stuffs.

when cancer goes through remission, doctors never vouch for a ""full recovery"" or ""no relapse"". depression is the same in a lot of ways.

what if I'm honest with myself, yet I'm still in the constant cycle of mood swings again and again and again? its not good advice if you're placing more expectation, and in turn more pressure on someone who is already depressed. many times people are depressed because they are too honest with what is going on around them.

what we are saying is, depression is just like any illness in the body. it can be chronic or one time affair, who knows? but with medical and emotional help we can still be a healthy and functional individual. and we want to be treated the same.

but don't tell me there can be forever sunshine because there's no such thing as forever sunshine. it's a fucking lie.

Depression can affect anyone regardless of circumstance so telling OP about how ""you probably have more than the avg person"" doesn't change anything, in fact may even make him feel worse. Aka ""I already have more than most people, but I'm still unhappy, what can I possibly do to feel better?"" Obviously I don't know OP's feelings but as a formerly depressed person (yes, clinically, not self-diagnosed) this sort of reassurance is generally not the best. 

>You don't really need a ""purpose"" in life, being alive is a purpose.

But some people feel empty without a purpose and don't want to just live day-to-day and take life as it is. Especially considering one of the effects of depression can be a crippling ""empty"" feeling. Makes you feel the need to fill it up.

>There is absolutely no reason for you to be down

This is not helpful. Why would you go up to a sad person and tell them ""there's no reason for you to feel bad"", that just invalidates their feelings and doesn't help them think through it at all."
e0dh3ja,torofrandominit,"Damn, yeah the public ones can’t dedicate as much effort to individual patients. I think you need to find something to hold on to. Anything, no matter how small or trivial, you can latch yourself to for you to stay afloat. Use those behavioral therapy methods, making small changes bit by bit. I know it sucks, but without medication, I feel it’s best to just keep your head above the water until it blows over. 

It’s very important that you don’t remain idle though. Setting up new habits and routines can be helpful in breaking the cycles of negative thought, I find. Cognitive therapy might be your best recourse now that you don’t think medication might be the best.

If you really can’t get your mind off those negative thoughts about yourself, talk to someone who can use conversation to let you distill those thoughts into a clearer picture of the mess in your mind. That’s something that helped me. Might work for you too. 

Your family doesn’t understand, but millions around the world do. I can talk to you regularly if you want. Not even about this stuff. It might be best to talk about everything except this, even.

Any attempt would be better than no attempt. I know it hard to muster strength to try, but fight on. And don’t ever beat yourself up for not being able to motivate yourself. Take it slowly.

e0e2dxu,sleepymunchkin122,"I am so sorry about that. I would advise going to a community service like feiyue where your counselling will get; subsidised and find someone who is trained in cognitive behaviour therapy. I think you need a counsellor who is more involved and guides you with moderating your negative thoughts and directing them into more positive ones.

Also, don't ever feel like you have nobody to talk to. It may seem very scary and that people will be bothered or belittle you when you talk to them, but trust me, they'd rather you do then to suffer in silence.

e0djfrx,iCandiii,"That's the problem. What is helpful? You keep saying that this is not helpful, that is not helpful, but what exactly is?

This is what I feel his parents are struggling with, understanding what he needs to help him be happy. They have already provided support. They have tried the counselling and the psychiatrist medication, so I'm not sure what is the next step. Even he isn't able  to articulate what exactly makes him unhappy. 

If what makes him unhappy is exactly what he says, that is that he feels a lack of purpose in life, there are many ways to deal with that issue. One is to change his mindset about what a purpose in life means, and I believe that to be really helpful. If you are able to change your expectations in life you'd be happier. The second thing he can try to to clearly identify his expectations and how he can work to reach there, at least there will be a concrete plan to work ahead.

I don't believe that saying ""I'm depressed, there is nothing you can do that will be helpful"" is helpful in any way. 

Unless you believe that depression is like heart diseases where your heart is damaged and you can't make it better unless you go for a heart transplant, which I wouldn't agree with you.

>But some people feel empty without a purpose and don't want to just live day-to-day and take life as it is. Especially considering one of the effects of depression can be a crippling ""empty"" feeling. Makes you feel the need to fill it up.

I feel comments like this are what makes people depressed and what makes OP worse. According to you, not living life a certain way means you are living life without a purpose and you are just living day-to-day. And then you try you make people who don't work in a purpose you deem worthy to feel lacking and empty. 

There is no reason to feel this way, you need to open up your mind. There are many ways to live life, and many ways to find purpose and not just society approved ones. This little guy is still schooling, there is a long way to go for him to find a cause he feels worthy to dedicate his life to. You don't need to fit him into a mould now and tell him he has no purposely just because he isn't interest in the same school courses and careers as you do. "

""let's do this or that and everything will be right"". a common cause of depression is not achieving an expected result set upon oneself or others. why is it I've tried a hundred methods yet I still seem to fail? it's a bloody abyss to even think of it

of course we would like OP to feel better and I believe every depressed person wants to feel better. but it's different from telling people ""you're not doing this that's why you're like this"", or ""do this and you won't feel like that"" or ""just get on with life"" as if every depression should be treated in the same manner. it's better to be honest and accept it might not be always rainbow and butterflies, but we want to help ourselves manage and lead a normal life. I think it's smoother to think this way and alleviate the burden on one's shoulder. after all people do get well waking up one fine day without doing anything (not that I will recommend this way also)

we need to acknowledge depression is a constant fight which all of us hope to see light at the end of the day.

anyway we are having a very open discussion and I don't find the need to be so passive aggressive or deleting comments. especially in a post where all of us relate to the desire for acceptance of ourselves and the community at large.

Some people have severe brain sickness. Some have it mild. Some get it genetically (where medication is needed) some situational (medication for a while and/or therapist) 

That's why my psychiatrist said as I was struggling to understand why I was feeling the way I felt (I have terrible anxiety that leads to depression). 

I'm not disagreeing with you. Training your brain to think differently (that's what Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is) and mediating helps.

e0f0y6j,iCandiii,"An amazing life is a life that's has nothing that can cause you pain, at least nothing that is immediately major. You can be unsatisfied with life, but you aren't hurting over it.

The next train of thought is that if you are so brain damaged or sick that you feel constant serious pain despite everything being rosy around you, what's wrong with euthanasia? Especially if you've tried all treatments to your disease but there is no cure nor even relief."
e0dlryp,iCandiii,"Well you can start by understanding that I'm actually a real doctor. Not a psychiatrist but a real doctor nonetheless.

The current hypothesis for depression is that it is due to a person's inability to deal with rising cortisol levels that can arrive from stress or other mean. This affects serotonin transmission and make the person fall into a dark hole. So the key to dealing with this is to identify what causes the rising stress that you can't cope with and deal with it in the first place.


>Having depression/anxiety is like having your brain falling sick for example the flu. You can't tell some to just stop sneezing or coughing

According to this, you can get someone to stop sneezing and coughing if you are able to get rid of the flu virus infecting the respiratory tract.

Thus, according to you, you should be able to get someone to stop being depressed if you get rid of the whatever is making your brain sick.

d5tfbte,deadbydurden,"Hi, I'm 20 and in an SG university right now. Myself and many of my friends have gone through the same depression and helplessness with the education system here, and we have all made it out whole and happier. Your post here tells me that you're feeling inspired to work harder and gain your footing, which really warms my heart. I really that you to know what I'm sure you can do it, not just the traditional route (aka Os and A levels) but the non-traditional as well. Happiness and success is not contingent on the path, just the journey and the lessons learnt. 

Some of my friends have gone overseas to study, either in a community college (usually America) or a foundational year in a university (usually UK). These options have been rewarding. The change of environment has been trying but its inspired many people and many of them seem to be heading towards brighter futures that us here, hah. 

Of course, the options above are only open to those who can afford it. I don't personally know anyone who's going through the route you're proposing, but there are definitely many people who take Os as private candidates. When I took my Os, we had about two dozen private candidates in the hall with us. It can definitely be done. 10 months is honestly enough time to get ready for Os. If you balance out the next 10 months between studying and taking breaks (very important to take care of your mental health), I'm sure you can do it. I'd recommend seeing a therapist at IMH if you have difficulty with your depression. At your age, you'll be assigned to the children's side. It employs a different method than the adult's section, as it's less about exploring the ""depths"" of your psyche and more about streamlining your feelings and motivations, and nudging you towards what makes you happy, ie what is important to you.  

I would recommend you to do your O levels first, and worry about your A levels later. Take small steps, set short-term goals. Start by putting in the work, enjoy the small victories, and then repeat. You can do it, believe me. If you take anything away from my comment, I hope it's that:

1. I believe in you
2. Balance between work and reward (something that you will have to learn, because no one is born with it)
3. Setting short-term goals and focusing on them, reward yourself when you achieve them. 

Good luck. "

d5tutgc,seriallain85,"I'm gonna ask something different from the rest of the herd. What is your passion or hobby? Can it be used to earn money? If it is a hard skill, even better. Develop that. Because that is your end game. 

I am not you and I don't know your exact circumstances but I can tell you if you think studying is going to make your life better, you can't be more wrong. Unless you are sure you know what your end goal is, don't study for the sake of studying. Have you seen university fees? Are the fees worth it? 

There are so many mindless people in Singapore that still go through the motion. Study PSLE > O > A > Uni. Finish Uni, work in ""dream job"". And here's the kicker, find out that the dream job is not really the dream job then end up doing something totally irrelevant instead. 

The world is changing so, so fast. What can earn money today may not be able to earn money tomorrow. IT, Bio, banking, even oil and gas cannot escape this cycle. The similarity in all these industries is that only the top 1% really earns a lot. And what do these 1% have in common? The passion that can take all burnouts. 

In my generation, the trend was to study banking, accounting and business. In my class alone, I can tell the business students all are unlikely to start their own business. Most are clueless and just hop into the hype. 

So what can you do ? Ask yourself what you really enjoyed when you were younger. If you don't have an answer, now is the time to find side jobs or go to the library to find out what you love to do in life. 18 is still considered very young and still a good time to make mistakes. As you get older, mistakes will be crippling. So now's the time for you to go out explore.

I'd suggest you take the local O-Levels and A-levels. Singaporean institutions do recognize the foreign certs, but they would also take into account that you were a local Singaporean who chose not to do local exams. They do this to prevent locals from beating the system by taking the easier exams."

Eventually, I used these IGCSE's to go to a JC abroad (UK), and got my A Level's Cert, which is therefore usable in applying to University here, or overseas (I'm thinking Australia maybe), so whatever the path you take, it should eventually work out in the long run!

I'm a drop out too at the age of 17. Found out that I was not up to ""studying"". Hence proceed to enter into the corporate world, so far so good. I'm age 26 right now and I've no regrets working at a young age :)

1st - hold on and be positive, reflect if what you've done if pursuing studies is what you want to commit. Go on ahead and strive well.
2nd - Depression is something that would either take you down or take it as a motivation ( pick a hobby, sports ) that will push you to strive better.
3rd - Take your time to think about your life / career / future plans, Singapore no doubt is a high rolling country and everything is expensive , but remember that you can have a alternative of working + part time studies if that is more suitable for you, some of the companies do provide fundings for the particular subject you are taking ( related or non related ).

d5tra9v,ChuanningTatum,"Hello! There've been many well written replies with good advice so I'm just here to let you know that if you're looking for any study help/someone to guide you academically for free when you're studying (be it local or overseas) you can drop me a PM and i'll ask around!

d5tsceg,ZanDisk,"Your plan is definitely plausible. 

""I plan to study most of my days off"", seems to suggest you hold a regular day job? However, to get a good grade on the exams such as to be worth the time and effort would usually require much more than that. Some structure in you learning would help a lot as well. The last thing you would want to do is to pull a half assed effort and be further crushed by disappointment and failure.

But on the other hand, attending classes formally and sitting for exams can be very costly. So you should really assess your current financial situation, and come to a better idea of your options. My feeling is that the greatest hurdle of your plan is your ability to finance yourself (through college), and your level of discipline.    
"
d5tszb1,gottaname,"Get your O level cert, get into a poly if you can, else get a diploma at MDIS or such. Once you are working, you can go parttime for a university degree.

Your aim is to get out into the workforce and work. Qualifications gets your foot into the door, but your work ethics and mental capacity plays alot. Go for a workplace which isn't toxic, would be hard but there are places with work/life balance. Sanity long term and good relationship with the management is a higher piority than having a high salary but all the stress in the world.

As for your mental state of things, get a productive hobby/sport which you enjoy and do well at it. Excercise and eat healthy. Win small battles to win the war."
d5tw0xz,delayeduser,I think figuring out what kind of industry you want to get into before throwing yourself into studying might be good as well. Not all industries look at qualifications. But at least a O level cert might be useful. That's the basic requirement for a bunch of entry level jobs. 
d5tx2l4,stereopaper,"If you're planning to go to a university overseas then the IGCSE's and the UK A levels are perfect. I did the same thing that you want to do but I have to finish my NS. So count yourself lucky that the odds are in your favour that you ""save"" those 2 years. 

Honestly, the IGCSE's are not THAT hard, do you intend on getting tutors online. My 2 cents is BE CAREFUL. I've heard a lot about bad experiences from tutors online. For the IGCSE math getting a local tutor should be enough if they look through the syllabus with you.

There are more of us out there than you think there are ;) "

d5tzqic,Solyca,"Hey kudos to you for taking such a big step to get your education back on track. 10 months is definitely doable, as many other commenters have said it's important to place goals within that time frame though. Things like ""this week i'm going to do these chapters and revise x,y and z that I studied last week. 10 months of committed studying is actually equivalent to much more than that in school time. The one thing I'm concerned about is that you didn't list additional maths in your list of subjects. If you do intend on going to JC which is definitely in reach you should know that Amath is a requirement for quite a few subjects, H2 Math, H2 Physics etc. If I'm misreading your intentions do let me know. All the best!"
d5u14mi,xiangusk,"Hi can you look into -> [this](http://www.all-gifted.com/allgiftedhighschool.html) and explore if you can use SATs to apply for University in Singapore.  

Edit: You don't need a cert to earn money if you know how to sell something. You do need a cert in some professions (engineering, teaching, etc). "
d5u1uld,nova9001,"I am not particularly sure of the education system in Sg since I came over for uni studies. I think you are still young enough to make a path for yourself (never too late to start). It is good that you have some goals towards to but i would encourage you to seek help from councellors (your previous school, local HDB, or church). Basically check with them if your plan is valid and if you are actually studying for the correct certs.

Lastly don't feel down, life is not a sprint. There is much to learn from mistakes and I hope you find your path."

d5uhqxg,nyvrem,"You're gonna need at least the O levels to get anywhere in Singapore. eg, Full time or Part time diploma. You never really stated what you're interested to read in university. There are some alternate ways to enter University in the UK.

Take for example, University of London's foundation program 

http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/courses/foundation/uol-international-programmes/international-foundation-programme

One program I found that does not require any formal qualifications to start is this ~

https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/about/advanced-diploma-in-data-and-systems-analysis

But if you don't have an understanding of math, it might be a tad tricky.

There's also some options to study with a US. university via some online courses. finish up an associates degree from Singapore (online) then move over to the US, to finish your full degree. It's open entry - so you don't need to show O/A levels. Most likely need to show IELTS or some English proficiency test.

http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Your-Associate%E2%80%99s-Degree-Online

Penn State (pretty decent reputation) actually offers an associates degree online

http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/directory/undergraduate/associate

in the US context, an associates degree is like the first 2 years of a 4 year degree program. once you've done with it, you go to a university to finish year 3/4.

Another option you can consider in your position right now is to sign up with Open University Australia. They have a university entry program.

https://www.open.edu.au/courses/

Open U is open entry. You don't need to show any O/A levels. Just sign up for each module and finish it. Slowly progress. You'll need 24 modules to graduate with a full degree, or do some and transfer over to Oz to finish a degree on campus.

Everything I've listed is basically open entry if you're going to consider skipping O/As.
"
d5uk8xm,imocus,"Your English is excellent, a lot better than many university graduates :) 

You can consider a freelance job as a writer while you study, it can get you cash and there's no need for any qualifications, just a good writing ability. 

Go search for content marketing, blog writer internships, especially in startups, they are much more liberal and don't look at qualifications as much. 

Alternatively look at online sites where they pay by words written, Google for freelance content writing and you should find many of them. "
d5w75j7,perkinsonline,"Anything is possible, just persevere even when it seems shitty. I'm a lazy bum who did my degree then masters."
d5ynjrh,sweetnothingnessx,"I think if you are looking to have a (professional) entry level job in Singapore you should aim towards one of two paths - (1) getting a diploma or (2) a degree. This doesn't have to be in medicine or accountancy or any of the typical singaporean paths, but something that you're interested and feel you can see a career in (nursing, computing, hotel management, real estate etc). Some other redditors have suggested following your passion and not bothering to get a degree. That is possible, if you're into non-traditional industries and very sure of what you want to do e.g. entrepreneurship or retail etc. However, unfortunately, for all other ""professional"" jobs e.g. nursing that require training, given how Singapore's economy works, you probably need either a diploma or degree.

To this end, you need to ultimately 

(1) get a diploma through
a poly
NIE (if you're into teaching)
a private institution (there are many part time 1 year diplomas http://www.academiccourses.com/Diploma/Singapore/)

The prerequisites for getting these diplomas are usually O levels. Therefore, I think you should indeed take the O levels once you feel you are ready and have studied enough. But I don't know how to take this as a private candidate and if it's advisable to take this without going through some sort of school. Someone I know did 'A' levels as a private candidate and ended up much worse than if he would have been if he'd enrolled in JC/MI/poly because he simply didn't have the resources/structure of school and lessons. Since it seems like you can afford it (?) maybe you should consider enrolling in private schools outside to help prepare you? I know for A levels / degree there are many like MDIS/Pearson but I'm not sure about for O levels.

(2) alternatively, if you are aiming for a degree, you might want to consider overseas universities in particular America. American unis  ONLY REQUIRE SATs and not any other qualifications. SATs are relatively easier to study for than 'A' and 'O' levels. SAT I consists of english comprehension MCQs + secondary 2 level maths. It's gruelling (4 hour examination) but the content is very manageable without having O levels and singaporeans do way above their american counterparts. SAT II is a subject test, you choose your subjects you want to sit for and they have many guidebooks available in the library to help you with. And some local uni courses also take into consideration your SAT scores if you lack qualifications! I believe SMU is one example. But maybe you can do this after you take your 'O' levels while waiting for the results.

I don't have much knowledge on the matter so i hope the information I give you isn't wrong! All the best I really admire your determination. You sound like you've had a horrible past but I just want you to know that even though I haven't personally experienced it, I know people who have managed to overcome it all :) You can do it! Even if the steps seem really small and slow but you'll get to a happier place. Please don't ever give up hope!!"
d5zgm15,,"* Hello! I took a conventional O->A->local university route so here's my advice. Don't study for the A-levels on your own. Do well for ""O"" levels, enrol into a polytechnic course and graduate with a diploma first. If you do well, you can enter a local university (I have many friends who took that route). If you can't enter a local university, at least you'll have a diploma which will guarantee you a certain starting salary. Many MNCs will promote someone who works hard, even if that person does not possess the necessary paper qualifications. With a diploma, you could also enrol into SIM and obtain a degree part-time while working to cover your school fees. 
* I don't advise studying for the A levels on your own. I'm an honours student from a local university who came from a shit JC but ended up doing better than my peers from the top JCs. I found the A levels immensely difficult. Without my incredible JC tutors, I would have scraped through. Many of my classmates did very badly, and could not enter a local university. Several went to private universities, and one re-enrolled into a polytechnic. Personally, i think the polytechnics are a better bet. "
d62jdga,Yr_virgin_is_mine69,"Late for the party but here goes. Read through some of your comments and if I hadn't read the thread, I would not have thought that you were drop out. Nontheless, really good to see people picking themselves up and improve themselves. Jia yous for your future endeavors! "
d5tzpxz,idetectanerd,"let uncle advise you.

first of all, i'm really happy that you woke up awhile back and is on your track! not to say that you are also very young so there are so much opportunity ahead.

to be honest, uncle here (i'm 30+ almost mid 30s), when i was young, i listen to others for what to study. those people are in their 50ish now and what they told me was to become engineer.

i took their advise since i'm good at computers and programming, took up this ultra boring subject and hey guess what? i excel in radio and now working for telecom. they pay isn't great but it is definitely better then other engineering except energy sector. ( our pay are roughly near 70k for people who are in this industry for 3-5 years and of course hardwork). but the problem here is that uncle did not listen to myself when i was young. i like programming as it is extremely easy, much easier than EEE itself, now green eye seeing my peer getting better pay for the knowledge i also know. >:(

what even worst is that other industries such as accounting, finance, shipping etc are doing extremely well and they are getting the similar pay as what i'm getting now.

i'm trying to get across you is that, what you study now is your future job, do you see yourself in that field?

next would be that it is great if you have your hobby as work but there are danger to it that your future customer may not like your work and demand changes which cross you. ended up you might lost interest in that hobby which sucks.

listening to others is good for reference, not as a decision. because you at 18 now KNOWS better what is for the future ahead than me who can only do and predict the next 20 years ahead. you should decide that kind of work you would like to be end of the day.

there are some sections that are forever needing people and not really tough job yet very secure such as accounting. every company need to account their $$, they may not need professionals in other field which can be outsourced. it may be extremely boring and tired to count and count but the money you take back is so good.

lastly, take a job that can fetch you good money should be what you take end of the day imho as long as it can fuel your hobbies. work is just work, enjoyment is what you want as a person.

wish you good luck!!"
d5tn9oz,ineedhelpplease17,"Hey! Thanks so much for the positive feedback. I know I am doing the right thing by earning myself an education, but I'm just unsure about the route I'm taking. I dropped out when I was 14, quit studying when I was 13. Do you think I can actually do it in 10 months? My sister is very discouraging, but she's in a similar position as me and isn't very educated.

I'm definitely looking into studying overseas! I took a two month trip to the UK and it was definitely an eye opener! I'm not joking when I say that the moment I stepped foot into my house, it's like the life was being sucked out of me. I definitely want to explore and experience the diversity that life has to offer, which is why I'm trying to study my butt off to earn myself that opportunity! :)

Of course, SG universities are also on my list. Heck, anything is fine for me now. Beggars can't be choosers, right? But I'd love to know more about your experience right now V.S. your friends overseas!"
d5tnxkk,ineedhelpplease17,I'll definitely try my best!
d5tzixf,AwkwardSheep,"This person has a point, there are plenty of fresh degree holders that did well throughout school who ended up have trouble finding jobs.

If you have a hobby or passion in a specialised field (baking, cooking, making video games, art) then I'd say going to a specialised school and developing your passion in those skills might hold better prospects than pursuing a more common general degree. For example, DigiPen's BSGD (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Game Design) and BAGD (Bachelor of Art in Game Design) have 100% employment rates within a month after graduation. 

If you like concept or environmental art, you should absolutely check out Feng Zhu's School of Design.

There are a lot of alternate options you have available to you that don't involve going through the typical education system. Regardless of what you choose to do, I wish you the best of luck!"
d5u608m,myepicdemise,"Your advice is golden.

>In my generation, the trend was to study banking, accounting and business. In my class alone, I can tell the business students all are unlikely to start their own business. Most are clueless and just hop into the hype. 

To offer business courses at the undergraduate level is kinda questionable in the first place. Top schools like Harvard offer business courses to allow mid-career professionals to network and make transition to a new endeavor. On the other hand, students freshly-graduated from JC and Poly courses have nothing to show for, which totally defeats the point of such courses. The local unis are giving a false sense of hope to the students and making them think their business degree is highly sought after."
d5u3uyu,dieaready,"This is so true. Take time to sit down and figure out what you want to be doing in life, not just short term, but long term goals, then think through how you will work towards it. So many people waste their time without know what they really want in life. It is good that you have a current short term goal of finishing your education, but would that fit into your long term goals? Higher level education shouldn't be the be all and end all of your life's goals, as on its own it doesn't do much for you."
d5u6zgg,ineedhelpplease17,"I've little hobbies/interest. When I recently picked up revision, I discovered a liking for Science and Medicine.. so there's that. I understand it's an incredibly expensive route to take but I'm not sure if I'm cut out for engineering, accounting or the likes.

Regarding making mistakes and all, I'm not sure about that. I'm under a lot of stress to not make anymore mistakes, and to do things right.

Honestly, I really just want to leave the country."

d5u0lp0,,"I second this, as some people have had this misconception before."
d5tnetb,ineedhelpplease17,"Huh, I never thought of that. Honestly, I just feel trapped in the country's education system. The fact that you HAVE to take mother tongue, and you HAVE to do this and that. It's flawed, and it's so stressful that they don't have any other routes rather than the traditional. For example, if you're a highschool dropout in America, you can get your GED done, etc.

d5u7873,ineedhelpplease17,"Yeah, that's a good tip - about the small goals. Sometimes it's daunting to look at the bigger picture, so you're right about focusing on taking small steps to not lose sight of what I want.

I'm also going to be really honest. I do want to migrate, or at least spend some of my years outside of the country. I recently made a two month trip to the UK and it was the best time of my life. I just feel.. so trapped in this country. It's not the people, I don't know. I can't be free here, it seems."
d5tnlj0,AuReliusDotA,10 months is more than enough time to prepare for o levels from scratch. Just make sure u put in the effort and u can easily enter jc. Jc is much harder though 
d5ulcd8,90DaysNCounting,"I sincerely admire your courage and dedication, and it's evident from the fact that you have a plan that you're serious about it.

Don't want to put you off but have to be careful seeing as you stopped studying at 13 and now you want to do O levels in 10 months.

Presuming you have retained knowledge up to Sec 1 well, that still means you're trying to squeeze about 3 years worth of learning into less than one.

I think you should start, and then see how you're progressing; if things are not progressing as quick as you expected or if you feel you need to backtrack to a less advanced stage I think you may need to be flexible and consider doing so.

I mean I'm sure some top students can do it but even then it's going to be quite painful; I think most of us average mortals might need a little more allowance than that."
d5u265w,sandara3,Digipen's programmes are degree level; I don't think you can apply with just O levels.
d5ubnfg,rule_by_committee,"Maybe consider nursing as a career? It's a skill set that's in high demand, almost anywhere in the world, and has lower entry barriers/costs than medicine per se. "
d5v9e1b,seriallain85,"If you are very serious about leaving the country. With the limited information I have about your situation, nursing is your best bet at the moment. 

1. Get your O level done in a year. 

2. Register to go NYP / NP nursing (there's 2 nursing schools now)
Nursing is considered a dumping course. The requirements to enter with a O level cert is amongst the lowest. 

3. If you are low in cash, sign bond and you get paid to study. But if you can afford it, obviously don't sign the bond. Just listing your options here. 

4. Graduate from school. Work approximately 2-3 years in SGH if possible whilst considering where you want to go. The next step will be a degree which can also be sponsored. The degree you choose will affect where you can go so think carefully here. Obviously Australia one is recognize in Aussie while UK one is recognize in UK. Some countries will recognize degrees from other countries. Its your job to find out which is :)

5. Learn an extra language if required to migrate to country of choice. 


There are many, many,many, many Singaporean nurses that are now in Canada, Australia, Europe, etc,etc. (Singaporean nurses are severely underpaid) Obviously if you are migrating to another country, the advantage will be to learn the languages of the country. Gives your Citizenship chances a boost.

Everything in nursing can be considered as ""free"" if you are willing to sign the bond. Of course the country of your choice would prefer a younger nurse than older one. So you have to weigh the benefits/cons yourself.  

The final hidden advantage of being a nurse is SIA has a strong preference for ex-nurses :)

Good luck and work hard!

There's no shortage of locals wanting to enter NUS/NTU/SMU, so no doubt there's a high chance you'd be at a disadvantage even if you get straight As.

d5ts4iq,angelsl,Just note that the international O and A levels are easier than the Singapore-Cambridge version and many international universities _do_ know that it is so.
d5u19r5,xiangusk,You must make sure someone is giving you the money to do it. It is expensive and please don't take a loan to do it. I paid my masters out of my credit card. It was a hard time and my masters was not as expensive as the undergrad.

This thought really kept me going. I was forced to take science in secondary and JC. My MT was really bad too. C6 for O-levels and an 'S' for A-levels. But I kept going and ditched science for my true love in the humanities in uni. I'd say SG universities are actually really flexible. Flexible enough for me to have switched majors from engineering to humanities halfway through. "
d5toiz3,ginger_beer_m,"Secondary school, if you dropped out of sec 3 or 4. If you only have a year or two there, then might as well finish it. 

Self study might work but people tend to lack the motivation to do so..  Especially if on their own. 

Private school... Eh I dunno. Like you said, they tend to be too expensive. 

Edit: ah I read your other replies. Like what the others said, doing a private O level might be the best at this stage, then enroll into a JC or poly. From there, get that A level or poly diploma, and if you want, go study abroad. However going overseas tend to be quite costly if you head to the traditional western destinations (UK, Australia etc) .."

d5vbwyk,fattybob,"My no response was referring to me not having any direct info regards getting work overseas or how to get there, but it looks like you've got a lot of guidance here, good luck.
Also, very important, think about what you will be looking for in ten and then twenty years down the road, not locking you into a route of course, but think about the skills you're learning in any course or job and the options later, there are a lot of people that just hate their jobs - but oddly enough, most of my colleagues (we all travel and work overseas generally) all love your jobs and work - perhaps it's the constant change that keeps us enthralled - I also know that it's not for everyone - some people are happy at home / near family etc which certainly  has it benefits "
d5u8p2c,stereopaper,"What do you mean by studying overseas? For uni or do you want to go to school there for a foundation year? I'm assuming money isn't an issue for you? 

I homeschooled myself, I have some textbooks you can have if you have you registered for your IGCSEs. Also it's best to identify what subjects you are bad at? What subjects are you taking? "
d5ueb78,loregorebore,"If your family can swing it, leaving the inflexible sg system is the way to go. 

Do a foundation year or 2 in australia or canada, then go to college there. Thats a common route for quite a few of my friends from china. It is also easier to emigrate if you do that, which is a bonus. 

This is a huge monetary commitment. Dont do this till you have worked out your problems and are ready to try to handle life as an adult. Probably around 40k/ year all in. Money you dont want to waste!

Advantage- you get a fresh start away from prior bad influences, in a more forgiving and encouraging atmosphere,and waste less time. 

Dont be discouraged if this is not possible.  But i will still try to leave and work overseas when possible. Singapore companies overemphasize standard academic qualification a lot so you will find it increasingly harder to compete if you try to join their race. Best to work on creating your own event. 

Good luck. "
d5ur3qb,,"You definitely need money, what you could do is apply for temporary foreign worker visa. I've seen lot of students from Korea do this which is why I'm suggesting it. 

Granted, you won't be working at professional job, but it will be grunt work to be honest but at least it gets you out the door.

Once you are out the door, and you got some money to support yourself, apply for Permanent Residency, and find a job in the mean time to get sponsorship (this is the tough part).

However, I've seen my friends who are from Korea that have successfully gotten PR card while working menial hourly wage jobs.

Where there's a will, there's a way! Lot of young Koreans are leaving Korea, and even going as far as Germany to become auto mechanics. I'd say that such solutions also exist for Singaporeans and any other country.

Canada always needs more workers and people in general (because the country is too damn big and population is sparse relatively compared to other countries).

Best of luck!"
d5vobim,wanahlun,"It will be very much helpful to look past school and studying. Studying may not be the conventional style of academically, e.g. via internships without the need for degrees or diplomas. Chefs, mechs, artists.

Don't want to let yourself getting caught up in the rat race chasing papers without knowing how to put them to use."
d5ubalv,code_wombat,"For somewhat cheaper go-overseas-and-experience-life options, you can google for ""work and travel <insert country>"".

US / UK/ AU / NZ have them, and they're mainly targeted at young people who want to travel around the country while working menial temp jobs usually in F&B / farms (eg. flipping burgers, making hotel rooms, picking fruit etc). These countries issue you a visa that lasts for X months while you work, so you'll travel in your off days or in between odd jobs.

The caveat is that usually these programs usually only accept recently graduated students of unis (and maybe polys?). So it's an option to see country X *after* you graduate.

Good luck !"
d5vewhj,idetectanerd,"i don't care how much down vote i gotten because i'm speaking the truth. people here generally believe in themselves more than what others would comment. i'm just gonna give a bit of life advise since uncle have walk more than most people here. 

the person who advised you for accounting probably saw what i saw, the unbalanced of pay system vs knowledge. great that you are a science person but the truth is that unless you are in a niche market in singapore ( i can only speak about singapore since i work here only), you gonna suffer and have to keep retraining yourself to upgrade, afterall science is always changing.

other subject is boring as hell i agree, most were better and well paid compared to science in term of knowledge vs work done. for science, you need to know so much and in work, most of it doesn't apply unless you specialised like i did (telecom require engineering maths such as fourier series to understand fault in radio, programming to write software etc.)

medicine is a great subject, do take note that Singapore although is branded as a med hub, it is not really though, there are other country that has already reach what we have just done such as korea.

To be honest too, it is really awesome that you went out and look around, did you realised that although singapore is too much of a control country, we are extermely well protected in daily life and our work is quite secured? do not just compare with the better apple superficially, understand their system well enough then you compare it with ours. 

take your time, you are still young, you still can make 1 or 2 mistake in your work goal.

if you are really going out, make sure you are not emotionally attached to someone here like bgr. you will hurt yourself most likely due to that long distance. i supposed you are cute because you said you were once in a bad group so probably have attracted many eyes.

when uncle was young, i'm pretty much argo and angst kiddo, i acted on impulse and reckless. older people advise were kinda lame. when i grew older, perspective changed. what i see back then were some mysteries why i would have done it in the first place."
d5to69i,ineedhelpplease17,That's very good to know! :D
d5u5pso,AwkwardSheep,"Ah you're right, I've changed my post. I also just found out that SIT favors polytechnic students! TIL

Thanks for the heads up."
d5ukhxu,ineedhelpplease17,Nursing definitely rings a bell in my head! :)
d5to3c9,ineedhelpplease17,"Like I said, local unis are definitely not out in my list but as of right now, I'm definitely thinking of studying overseas. I see.. This is how it's playing out in my head: I'm a secondary school dropout. I've no life ambitions, and I've nothing. I might as well get a iGCSE and then A level certs. Someone, something out there will want me then."
d5u637m,myepicdemise,Yeah but it simply means that these overseas universities might be more lenient on candidates applying using the Singapore-Cambridge cert. A Singaporean holding an international A Level cert will still have the same priority as any other foreign student.
d5u0pm3,,"Unless you are a better self-learner, because ironically some people dont take lectures and tutorials well."
d5u7hho,ineedhelpplease17,"That's a discussion I'm having with my father. What I meant was the schools/preparatory courses for O-levels cost more than 10k for less than a year, and I'm not sure if I can take that when there are cheaper alternatives - i.e. GCSEs."
d5u72qb,ineedhelpplease17,Thank you!
d5u5y8f,sandara3,"Yep! most of the students there are from related courses in the polys. They do get the rare A level students or from unrelated courses though. 
"
d5toqa3,myepicdemise,It would be a problem applying to JC if your cert is not local either. The admission would be on a case-by-case basis. You may have to do A Level at a private school if you don't get admitted.
d5uiql5,angelsl,Yeah... my point is it may be marginally easier to gain admission with the Singapore-Cambridge A levels than the UK A levels.
d5u2qqy,fgd12350,I agree that some people learn better themselves but generally there will still be questions that they cannot answer by themselves and will need a support structure to help them
d5u95sr,myepicdemise,"Do you have a minimum of Secondary 3 Express education? Because bad news -- that's a minimum requirement by some of the schools offering O Level preparatory course. So even if money is no object, they wouldn't allow you to enroll. And I have to remind you again, GCSE is the path to the unknown. You could potentially waste one whole year and thousands of dollars because no local JCs/Polys are willing to look at your cert. You wouldn't want to regret in the future for having taken the easy way out."
cpyhxwm,,"Back in the days, my platoon did the most guard duties in the whole camp. We complained, we whined, we cleared it. Weekends, public holidays, right before an exercise, we did them. 
If you think you are doing too many weekend/ph duties, count them and compare with your mates. Voice it up the chain of command.

Back then we did so many duties, we created a excel list printed, counting the number of guard duties we all did and ranking who did the most and when etc.

Thats NS, hang in there."
cpxu7rj,dashrandom,"> And I as a dual vocationalist (something + driver) does work like everybody, extra sai kang, **does guard duty and never get to claim any off.**

Is that true for all dual vocationalists in your camp? Or does this only apply to you?

I'm pretty sure you can claim off for guard duty on a PH. Look at the SAF handbook. Any recent S1s or S1 clerks like to comment on this?"
cpxypxu,j_fat_snorlax,"Is everyone else getting the same treatment or are you the only one being treated this way. 

Are the duties always fixed days or is someone deliberately scheduling your duties this way? If it's the former and you're getting duties on public holidays you should be getting off in-lieu. If it's the latter, speak to whoever the fuck is planning your duties first and if it doesn't change, speak to their superior.

If nothing changes, go plot out your average working hours per month on a chart, as well as your peers' for the last six months and go talk to your OC.

You see them as your comrades, do they see you as theirs? If they don't, then why do you care so much? Don't ever report to camp if you're sick. Make sure you go to a polyclinic.

"
cpxz36c,naruto1014,"Another easy way is to go for a wisdom tooth check up at a SAF dental centre and get them to refer you to a hospital for extraction. 

A painful and sure way to get 4x7 days of mc is to pluck out all four wisdom tooth one at a time.  I went to NUH and pluck out  two tooth and got myself 2x8 days of mc. That doesn't include extending the mc elsewhere after it ends.

Hope this helps because NS really does drain a lot from you when you have a poor environment. (I had almost 4 weekend duties a month along with weekday duties) "
cpymfg1,robertsky,"You had it easy, imo. I was in an unit that was severely undermanned. Guess what was my schedule like for most of the time in the unit? 2 days guard duty. 1 day stand by at home. and the cycle continues regardless of weekends and public holidays."
cpyn6t0,gingerbreaduncle,"Don't do anything stupid that might get you charged.

Hang in there until ORD. Years later, all this will be but a memory while you live your civilian life."
cpys0h8,bxnlxxng,Tbh I love long weekend duties. I always volunteered for them. My battalion mates included so I can't be the weird one.
cpxrgyv,thasianone,"Hey bud, nearly everyone who has been through army would feel about the same way as you, about why trying so hard only gets shit in return. Hang in there. 

I would not say they don't value you but sometimes commanders are probably taking the easy way out and assigning it to people who knows they will do it. These are the people who may value you as a person but are unable or do not reward or appreciate. Sound off your displeasure, but don't do anything reckless that will result in further punishments (trust me).

Now of course, on the topic, the easy way to keng is to check yourself into A&E on a sunday night, and say diarrhea. That will clear you for a monday. This would take about 2 hours+ from experience. Normally I would return to camp after that, because it automatically gets you att-b for a few days, so that pretty much gets you clear to wed. And then, report sick on thus, but this is where it gets hard as M.O in camps tend to don't give anything.

Well thats all I can think of, but still, I would advise you to stay strong, and let your gf understand that you have no choice (which you really don't), and endure it all the way till ORD and always enjoy your off days. "
cpzivn4,slackerism,"Either your PS or CSM isn't doing a good job like mine. Or you haven't voice out enough. Not sure how long you have to ord but hang in there bud. Im in the same shoes as you cept. Being a 3sg has slightly more benefits. Such as 2 guard duties a month and 1 cos. Sometimes we get activated for 48 hours with nothing to claim. 
We don't sleep during guard duty cause sadly for 3sgs there's no such thing as rotations not for my unit/camp. Most of the time I'd much rather be a man if not for that extra cash that i really need. There are units that treat their people like shit and heavenly ones that stay out. Just grind through it unless you're fine being a 3rd class citizen. At least you don't have to deal with an OCs bright idea of doing stupid shit and having to tell the people under you and having no way to explain the stupidity of it.
all i have is my recon tab and 2 months to ord"
cpxwupe,ArchDragon92,"Yes, off can be claimed from your superiors if your guard duty falls on a PH. And again, the validation period of your off depends on the unit.

E.g. For my unit, the off I claimed expires 1 month from the day I claimed."
cpyjyy8,wunderfool,"Yes. All duties on PH are entitled to off-in-lieu, unless it's an extra."
cpxux9t,Depressednsff,"Sorry I forgot to mention, don't know just plain unlucky or what, it's always the day after PH or a long weekend, end up no off, book in on the day of PH, book out on a Sunday morning, then booking back in the night after. 

My coys dual appointment gets to claim off every month and me and the other dual voc gets jack shit while having to do shit work. 

Maybe I'm just another angst NSF with much to complain about. I know I don't have the best point of view in army even before enlisting, and even now and ever will be."
cpyr0lv,nightfucker,Won't let you pluck 1 at a time de. Maybe 2 at a time. But very sian during the recovery period one
cpyeus7,Depressednsff,"I don't even know if I have wisdom tooth haha, my situation is the same as you, I just had my duty this Monday then coming Saturday and the following Thursday. 

I gotta ask my friends since I generally didn't have much pain when growing my wisdom teeth."
cpxv3lo,Depressednsff,"Which is why I stop trying to bother anymore. That kinda keng wouldn't do much good, we have light duty and RMJs doing guard duty as well because of their so called lack of manpower but I appreciate your advice."
cpyg3gg,dashrandom,Talk to your other dual voc and ask him of willing to swap duties so you can have some off as well? I think that's pretty simple. 
cpysh69,naruto1014,"ehh really meh, my dentist asked if i wanted do one at a time lol"
cpyjj37,naruto1014,you can just go for the checkup! (free ma) if you don't have any that's a bummer then :/
cpyhp3z,CEROthesis,"Dude I know that feel. Iam a fellow dual VOC NSF too and guard duty in my camp is pretty bad too because of lack of manpower.I haven't had it too bad though as they aren't a lot of bad people in my company.

Hang in there man, kengsters gonna keng and selfish people only look out for their own interests at the expense of others even their ""friends"". You should lower your expectations of your fellow nsfs, most of us are here to serve and fuck off, expecting them to honour their duties as you do is unrealistic and in the ends only comes back to make you only more depressed.

First ask around and make sure you are indeed getting an unreasonable amout of guard duties, if the people around you are doing as much then bringing up the issue will only make you look bad.Make a list of the days you did guard duty for the last few months and talk to your csm/commander in charge of the guard duty allocation.Try to suggest starting a point system for guard duty personnel if it doesn't exist, that way people not doing sufficient duties can be easily picked out.

Of course it ultimately comes down to the environment and people of your camp.If the environment is toxic it just means the wrong people have too much influence , nothing much you can do except to adapt to it.

TLDR Guard duty especially weekend duty brings out the worst in people.

"
cpyt1at,nightfucker,"Where u do sia lol? I just did mine 2 months back i was only given the options of 2 or 4 at once. So were my friends. I did at NDC, my friends did at Alexandra and NUH. "

he asked if i wanted pull 2, all 4 or 1 by 1"
cpynin9,CEROthesis,"Congrats man.

Doing duties on Public holidays isn't so bad , in fact some people like doing them for the incentives. Most people get unhappy when they have to do too many duties or burn too many weekends or if their block out dates are ignored.

If you are unable to understand our frustrations over regimental duties, I can only say that you have been pretty lucky to be working with reasonable and nice people ."
dpd1nom,freedaemons,"Imagine yourself happy and fulfilled. What are you doing? Work toward that. 

If you can't imagine that, you are in fact depressed, mate."
dpd2um8,thexynapse,"What do you mean meaninglessness of life? For me, I used to feel the same way. The rigorous process of school,day in day out. I kept on searching for meaning till I realised that the meaning of life is to search for that meaning. It may sound stupid but listen here. No one truly knows the meaning of life. 

Are you male or female? If you're male, I'd assume you're in NS/ just came out. If you're female, you might be looking for a job. Well keep on searching. Remember that you shouldn't set goals too far ahead. Make stepping stones you can reach. The truth is, no one can give you the answer to life. We're all searching for it.

 I'd suggest picking up a hobby or getting a pet. They give you meaning and help you make friends. And if you're like me and have many interests, start on one. Always wanted that six-pack? Well go get it! Always wanted that pair of ultra boosts? Well save up for it!

You mentioned that you spend most of your time in front of the computer. Then make good use of it. Hell, learn Korean. 

Another thing I'd like to add is, don't say ""I'll do it tomorrow."" That breeds laziness. Instead, do it today. Now. Right now. Don't give yourself excuses. Make today a non-zero day. What do I mean by that? Today, be it 1km or 10km, going for a run is better than doing nothing. That one squat or push up will slowly lead up to 10, then you'll do more till you achieve your goal.Can't find a job? Call that company up. Even if it's one company, you turn that 0% chance into a 1% chance, if not higher.

Life is exhausting and you won't be guided the whole way.You need to learn and do it by yourself, because that's how you learn to not only live, but prosper."
dpd8n5h,SpockySkellintons,"Idk boi. Id say money, bitches and weed is all you need to be happy but that dont apply to Singaporeans.

Get a hobby, get the fuck out of your comfort zone. Do stuff you never thought youd do like drinking a packet drink without straw. Stop using the computer and go out. Take a bus ride into town or the 966 bus loop from woody to ECP loop back. Take the time on the bus to reflect on stuff.

Get on Tinder maybe? Ive met a couple of nutcases there before knowing my gf but i mean you could try ah. 

Im also passing my days just like that. Totally nothing interesting fuckin mundane- eat, shit, sleep that kinda stuff. But at least i got stuff to look forward to. Do you? I find being optimistic is the best way to stave off depression. 

Oh yeah you said you were playing it in hard mode solo? Same here even though my case would sound like 'rich people problems' but i assure you its not the case. Many people dont understand us or they pretend not to because they do not want to open ***THAT*** box. I understand. 

If you wish to talk more you can always pm me on reddit. If you were a month earlier we couldve met up and be really good friends."
dpdbjjj,Unusualist,"Is there something that you are aware of that prevented you from initiating and maintaining friendships? I saw that no one had mentioned this yet, and feel is a valid point to ponder.

I don't have many friends too, but for those few handful that I have, I put in quite a bit of efforts to talk, text, go out and eat although I am awkward penguin irl, etc. I think these helped retain the small but OK social circle that I have.

Apart from hardcore gaming/browsing internet, is there any interest that you may have? Interests are quite good places to start seeking for motivations and friends/acquaintances in my opinion.

I developed a strong interest in brewing my own coffee as an alternative to instant coffees and $1.10 local coffee drinks. Have the luxury of able to brew with my own apparatus at work, and found that I attracted some people to communicate with me especially those who share similar interests with me (coffee). I think it helped me get going at work to fill my social void as I am very shy to initiate talks on my own, and take a while to get comfortable with strangers. There are days I simply look forward to my next cup of coffee. 

The reason why I skipped online related interest, is because I think since you've found that those friendships you tried building online behind monitor screens don't last, why not give alternative options a try?

Saying so, I am willing to be a listening ear if you need one. Gamed heavily and lost a lot of social aspects of my life while growing up. Finally able to gradually kick the gaming habit due to work. I still game, but less and no longer hardcore. Drop a PM if need.

Wish you the best. "

another website is 7cups where you can talk to listeners ."
dpetbcp,betterthanchicken,Maybe everyone who feels the same way in this thread should arrange a meetup irl
dpd0z2f,UncivilisedMonkey,"With regards to the meaninglessness of life, I would suggest you check out some of Jordan Peterson videos on YouTube. 

However, the more pressing problem of finding new friends is a tricky one. From what I gather, most people you like to befriend would most likely reached their ‘quota’. If you didn’t catch them early, unless some specific circumstance arise, you probably have no chance of. We missed out, that’s that. I can think of no solutions, except for you to just keep trying. Step out more, join a social club, try to meet new people irl and see how it goes. 

Contrary to the notion of you can make digital friends, I highly doubt it. I think humans need physical closeness as a precursor to psychological closeness. 

Side note: For myself, aside from battling with the crippling feeling of loneliness, I occasionally get the courage to upgrade myself, physically-do some exercise, or learn skills that maybe useful in the future. Frankly, if you really step on the path of self-improvement, there’s not much time to spare thinking about how to combat loneliness... well until your old friend (darkness) comes to chat with you again "

A handful good ones are great enough and heck, even better. I used to have them throughout these 2 years (Come and go).

To be really honest, I can't think of any interest. Past  interests are now activities I do normally in my life now, no social interaction.

That is cool, simple happiness.

Everything starts online nowadays. Some leads to meet-up, some getting ghosted. I have never tried approaching a stranger just to befriend them, it is just is not a Singaporean thing I guess, they would think I have a motive or something.

dpd7csm,freedaemons,"Here's the secret: What you imagine mightn't actually give you the satisfaction you think it will. The greatest shortcut to satisfaction is a sense of productive self-determination. As long as you believe you can make yourself happier, you think you know how to do it, and you actually work toward it, you'll get along just fine psychologically. After all, if what you envisioned wasn't all you chalked it up to be, you can reimagine your future and keep moving on."
dq62voz,thexynapse,"Going to the gym is a great place to start. Set a goal for yourself. Work towards that goal and find other people with similar goals, or at the very least others who are working towards a goal. They can be fat or fit, it doesn't matter. Because working together will help everyone motivate themselves. Since you're going for NS, I'd advise prepping for NS. In fact, you might enjoy it. This sounds crazy, but I have a cousin who hit a roadblock in life, because he was bad at studies and pretty much most of what he did. But once he went for NS, he realised he loved the military and signed on."

Yes, there can be work-life balance in most industries, if you want to. If you learn to work effectively and efficiently and get the important tasks done right punctually, no good boss will stop you from leaving on time. Always remember you have a life outside work.

Bad boss? OT culture? Incompetent and can't get things done right? You still have a choice to have work-life balance; but at this junction, you have to decide for yourself if career progression is less important. Still, you have a choice. Unless you are in some shitty but usually high-paying profession.

Also, if work often feels meaningless to you, you might want to consider other options. Or try to find some meaning in your work to make work feel less painful."

And you will also have to take shit from shitty people (more so at some places than others) and do a lot of ""meaningless"" tasks because you're junior. Only after you put your nose to the grind for a good ten years or so can you then earn a lot of money *and* have a better, less hectic life.

If you're out to become outstanding and exceptional in your chosen field this initial perseverance is very important. Yes, you may have to work 12 - 14 hours a day, but you'll eventually learn to prioritise and unwind on off-days and weekends. If you can't get past it, well, not everyone's made to be the best at what they do anyway. You could then consider other options, but they may come with opportunity costs (usually money). "

It's really true, which is why the entire concept of ""work-life balance"" befuddles me. My life and my work are one and the same thing. I'd rather be doing what I love and investing in what I'm passionate about than just sitting around doing nothing.

Sure, not everyone ends up doing what they really love. Sometimes it's about the sacrifices we are willing to make to get to where we really want. Just think about what you'd really want to do if money were no object and go do that. (Doesn't really help if you're a directionless, basic bitch that says 'travel the world' though) "
dgudfr4,potatetoe_tractor,"Work life balance is doable for some industries, impossible for others.

For those in the financial and IT sector, ala white collar jobs , it all depends on your efficiency. Get your  daily workload done and you are golden.
For those in the service and manufacturing industry, it is a different story. The workload is always growing and OT is the norm. Bosses will also expect you to pull OT to meet production quotas /deadlines. Is OT mandatory? No, but your ""willingness"" to do OT will affect your next pay increment as well as your standing when the management is looking for people to axe from the roster."
dgub41u,Luo_Yi,"Work/life balance in SG?  Hahahahahaha.

Not too long ago my employer sent out a bulk mail advising everyone to use up their carry-over vacation balance within 30 days or forfeit the balance.  The email explicitly stated not to approach our Project Managers for a deferral because they could not override HR.

I scrambled to find a suitable trip and found two holiday packages (non refundable).  Unfortunately when I approached my Project Manager for leave approval he rejected it because ""we were too busy"".  When I pointed out that we were under instructions to use our leave immediately, and that I had booked non-refundable trips he told me that it was my risk for booking trips without seeking approval first.

I thought about it for a couple of days then sent an email to the HR Manager, and Project Manager outlining the brief history of this issue and advised them that as a contractor I believed the management practices they were executing were unfair to employees and that I no longer wished to be a member of their team.

After a few panicked emails and phone calls they compensated me for one trip and allowed me to take the 2nd.  So happy ending (this time).

But I pity employees in SG who are not in my situation and cannot easily push back against their employers when they act unfairly.

Edit: Regarding work/life balance... yesterday I worked from 7:30AM to 10:00PM because there were some critical activities at work that needed to be addressed."

companies where you have to OT to pretend to work hard have no concept of productivity and probably not going anywhere. jump ship asap. these kinds probably wont last a recession. (unless you are in glc or cs)

most mnc have good work life balance. 

and dont choose jobs like auditor etc. they have to work major OT during months where they close books.

dgtn0l2,alt_generic_acct,Of course it does.. Nah i'm kidding
dgum288,Snowstormzzz,"I think there's a serious OT culture happening, especially with the introduction of laptops and higher wages when compared to other SEA countries. A lot more companies are asking why they can hire someone in SG when they can hire 2/3 in Manila to do the job.

As a result, they expect us to do 2-3x more work than our peers in Manila, ignoring the fact that Manila has random holidays (Today is a holiday for them) and that the quality of work is pretty shoddy. Also, their wages have been rising by quite a bit since a lot of MNCs moved their call centers/shared service centers to Manila.

Add this in to poor bosses who believe that they pay you to work, not to life, and you will end up with poor morale, high turnovers and lazy staff (If I am expected to do 1 hour of OT a day, expect me to reddit 25% more a day).

Of course, the bosses won't see it as their fault, even if  exit interviews show that a lot of people are leaving because there isn't any work life balance. All they are interested in is to show the market that the company has plenty of cash, and they are hitting their quarterly estimates every single time.

Don't look at the negative aspects of NS, try to enjoy the physical activities. During your off time, go read a book, watch some TV series off your phone or tablet, meditate. Get your mind off being a soldier. That's how you retain your sanity. 

I thought an infantry posting was a death sentence, it can be bearable if you live life as a weekly struggle. Look to every mealtime as a small victory. Your time will speed by before you know it.

Don't do social media and focus on the task at hand. Talk cock with your platoon mates.

d70sp16,changsst,"Hey Bro, 

Which Phrase in the army are you at now? 

For the first 6 months I struggle in army too. Like you I can't seem to find my place in the army.

Mostly I contribute it to the change of environment. Living with military rules I felt confined and awkward.

I also kept hearing ""2 years only, suck it up and move on"" and I understand that don't help at all.

How it got better is when I changed my perspective. Instead of being overwhelm by the environment, I distract myself with thoughts of planning for my future. I find small pockets of time to plan what school or work am I going to do. Then find out what it takes to move towards that objective.

I told myself that all my peers are stuck in the army too, I can gain an advantage by thinking and working on my objectives.

Worrying and feeling frustrated I realised only trapped me in the present and the more I kept thinking of ""The 2 years in army"" the more frustrated I become.

Get to make one or two good friends along the way. It will help time pass by a little bit faster and better.

Realise all the struggles are in the mind. Work the mind.

d70smeu,flossdraken,"P-tagged (psych issues) NSF here diagnosed with depression, among other disorders, prior to enlistment. You should definitely reach out for help through the channels available to you. If you fear the army MOs being dismissive and refuse to refer you for specialist diagnosis, then seek to get diagnosed outside first – at a public hospital preferably, for credibility – and take the specialist letter to MO for appropriate escalation. They won't ignore a letter from a public hospital's psychiatrist. If you're diagnosed with depression and not just an adjustment disorder, chances are you'll be down PES; if your condition is severe enough to warrant C9-E9, you'll be around others with similar issues as you at work, so the stigma isn't that bad here. 

Don't be scared by the classic fearmongering tactics. As someone already mentioned, your future employer probably wouldn't ask for your medical records, and they have no way of checking because it's medical-in-confidence. Not so sure about public sector employers, but getting better/not letting your condition worsen should be your primary concern now. One step at a time. "

I also recognize some like-minded platoon mates and chill with them, started a part degree course during army and my other platoon mates did their GMATs to get to their desired uni. Pretty sick life after that, I bought weekend desk guard duties (for specs) for like $200, getting paid to study and started getting a little more positive.

Don't worry about your friends and dad. Mental health is still not very important here in Singapore and some people don't understand it because they don't have said issues (so they look at it from an ultra-rational point of view). 

I don't know how it is in your unit, but everyone says that the person on mc is chao keng, and you shouldn't think too much of it. More importantly, does it matter? Malingering is what they call lying about your health, and you obviously (from what you're telling us) have an issue. This is your mental health at stake, and if they still think so after you are *diagnosed* and *going for treatment*, then you should be dropping them like a hot pocket.

From personal experience, you'll be sent to MMI for a psychiatric evaluation (you will need to bring a relative along), possibly committed to an observation ward. Then after that comes regular visits to the psychiatrist, as well as counseling sessions at CMPB. This is maybe once every few months for the former, and about once a month for the latter.

One thing however, if you're already seeing a doctor for any issues, maybe you can ask for a referral to a psychologist from the hospital first, because while your problem may be legitimate, sometimes MOs don't give a fuck. Either that, or get a referral from a poly doctor."
d70x265,jaemian,"I can empathize with how you feel: I have someone really close to me who went through the same thing, and the process of helping him get through it almost ate me alive as well.

The first step is to accept that this is your new reality, and you will have to work your life around this new sudden confinement.

When people say suck it up, it does not means you just take it and live life for army. You have to plan to live your life **around** army. This means that although your life becomes a routine due to the regimental lifestyle, you need to find ways and things to add some rhythm to your life. Think back about your former self. What activities or hobbies did you engage in that kept you happy? If these past activities are no longer possible, then do something new. Read a book, pick up a new skill or volunteer at a dog shelter. You need to find something to do when you're not in camp that helps resembles some form of ""normal"" civilian lifestyle. Do not let army take over your life.

It is important to have friends to hang out with during your downtime (time outside of army). You mentioned that you pushed away your friends due to issues resulting from army. You're doing yourself a disfavor and being unfair to your friends. They are not responsible for incapability to transit to an army lifestyle, so try not to lash out at them. If it is due to their inability to empathize with your difficulties to army life, then unfortunately, majority are unable to comprehend problems related to mental health, as most Singaporeans have issues understanding something so intangible. This is something you will have to accept and cope with. Keep your friends with you. They can help you adjust to your new life by providing familiarity, but forgive them if they are unable to understand your problem. Do not continue engaging them in your problems if they do not genuinely try to understand your difficulties in army. You will only get more frustrated in trying to break the wall, beginning a vicious cycle of anger which may result further alienating your friends.

Ultimately, you will have to accept your life is changed for these 2 years, and plan to live around it, rather than lamenting in it. Always have activities planned during your downtime. Do not give yourself time to think and lament. If someone is unable to understand your problems and casually brush it off, do not take offense. It is hard to find someone who can really take the time and effort to help you through this difficult period, so understand that the road in these two years could be hard and lonely but you need to take charge of it. If you really need to talk to someone, please find someone professional who can at least empathize with your problems. It is alot more productive and less frustrating.

Good luck, these two years might look long, but once you hold control over your life now, you will find it flash by. You will also find yourself more resilient as a person when you go on your future endeavors. "
d71ta65,,"I personally went through depression when I was in the army. I want you to understand that this is only a temporary setback. It might not seem like at the moment but this will go away. Things are not as bad as it seems. But I need you to take some steps to help yourself. This is very important.

1) This weekend or whenever you book out. Please walk into IMH at Buangkok. There's no shame in seeking help. The people there are very helpful and understanding. Tell the doctor everything honestly. They will prescribe you the right medication. But you must take this step. If you are feeling ashamed or guilty of your condition, Do Not Think That. Depression is the flu of the mental illness and it's more common than you think. 

2) In IMH, the doctor might give you a medical cert or letter specifying about the situation. Please take this and give it to your commanders or MO. Again people are more understanding than you realise. You are not the first person in NS having depression. 

3) Book an appointment with a psychologist. This is just a fancy term for a friend and a listening ear. But this is no less an important step. You can ask the psychiatrist (doctor) to help you book that IMH. Or in some neighborhoods they have Family Service centers. Go to the site and book an appointment. They are quite good with timing so you can book a session in the evening. 

https://app.msf.gov.sg/Policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Family-Service-Centres

4) Please take of care of yourself. Please start to be disciplined about certain things if you already are not. Make sure you take your food at the right time. Do not skip your meals or showers and make sure you get enough sleep. I know this is NS and things might not go your way but it's important that you set a routine whenever possible. Do not procrastinate. 

5) Finally this will take some time to heal but it will heal. I need you to have a zero fuck attitude towards certain things. Stop caring about what people will think. What they think is none of your business. That's their problem. They can call you whatever. I had an asshole officer laugh at my condition, I just laughed along. That's just way things are. Your job is not to change them but better yoursf. Just go about doing your stuff. Do your NS duties diligently and religiously. This will help you focus and take your mind off self pity. Talk to people, make friends. See the humour in everyday stuff. Laugh it off. Someday you will look back at this as an achievement. 

It might not seem like it is but this is an opportunity. An opportunity to better yourself. You are a very valuable member of our society. We all care about you. You are important to your parents. You are important to all of us. You are doing a very important job.

d70tyaq,useme,"I have a friend who got downgraded because of depression. I never really got the full story but he started the process by speaking with an MO. Got posted to some office job and was much happier there.

After spending a few months at his new posting and was supposed to have ""recovered"" and resumed his original duties, his commander put in a report with some embellishment saying his was still under a lot of stress. He was able to stay at his new posting until ORD.

So it may not be the case that all people with depression are treated without compassion.

I'm no doctor but I do have some familiarity with depression and you seemed depressed to me. Regardless of your army situation I strongly advise you to speak with a doctor. If you don't want to see an MO then go to a polyclinic and see a GP.

>if I seriously am diagnosed with a problem and have to go to IMH to get a record, my future job prospects will be ruined, and obviously getting a record isn't good at all

You're employer does not have to know. So what if you have a record at IMH? First of all no one but the people treating you are allowed to access those records. It certainly cannot be obtained by the public. Secondly, every embarrassing medical issue you told your doctor is recorded. Did you really think twice before telling your doctor in those cases?"

Ok, you said about your issues and problem but did not specify what these problems and issues are.  You stated you hated the army life....that's fine and all as nobody likes it...but you never states what aspect of army life you hate and why.

I know depression is a real thing but still, you need to calm down and think (not feel) through all these 'problems' you are 'facing' and access them in the most logical manner.

Are you getting bullied? Discriminated? Persecuted? What is your 'problem' and 'issues' exactly? Depression is an easy 'blanket statment'. Since before army you do not have depression, what aspect of army life triggered this 'depression'? You should at least know about these things right?

Don't focus on how long you're going to take to ORD/ROD. Focus on short term goals like ""I'm finally going to complete this course in xx days"" or ""xx days till yy exercise is over"". Take it step by step.

You're becoming an adult, growing up and finding your self. Be very gentle on yourself and make sure you are taking care of yourself as best as you can. You are going through a difficult time during this transition and it is important that you acknowledge what you are going through. So, right there thank you for reaching out and seeking some help and connection. 

Maybe you can look up a teacher you respected to talk to about what are feeling. Teachers are often eager when their former students look them up and maybe they can connect you back with the person you used to be.

Right now you need support, but don't need to go to IMH unless you're suicidal or hearing voices or something drastic like that. You're in a tough phase of life so you do need support to get you through.

I myself took up to learning and playing tabletop RPGs as most of the books have decent amount of lore you can read to pass the time, and you could think on expanding on it in your own way while doing meaningless tasks, the more meaningless the better, more time I can use to design the next session.

I had another NS mate who played League of Legends and he's kept himself relatively sane by memorising the entire itemlist, effects and prices, and planning out his item build step by step while waiting for his post take over to come, and near almost every end of shift he'd have himself written out a small list and steps while he looked forward for the end of his shift.

Make short term goals for yourself to look forward to and the time will pass incredibly fast. But perhaps for starters, look forward to the end of the week, then adjust from there."

Don't fret, things will only get better. 

As for why you feel left out, you need to make a conscientious effort to embrace the ns culture of not using your brains, and drop the elitist mindset of only doing things when brainpower is required. 

Same goes for working life. Before you enter you'll think that you'll be doing something which requires brainpower but very quickly you'll realise that those jobs are either reserved for the 1% who are extremely gifted or come from rich families that are able to waste their life away doing jobs that dont pay well but is extremely interesting, while the ordinary peasants like you and me are stuck doing shit which does not require application of your brains.

It certainly cannot be obtained by the public. Secondly, every embarrassing medical issue you told your doctor is recorded. Did you really think twice before telling your doctor in those cases?

According to the doctor at MMI, the records are accessible by anyone from the civil service, so it does follow you to a certain extent. Moreover, if a future employer asks you to declare any previous medical conditions and you do not declare your depression, he has grounds to fire you and you have no recourse. The law for employees is pretty weak in this regard.

If you do see a doctor for depression, what you want to aim for when talking to the doctor at MMI is ""adjustment disorder"", this just signifies that you have problems adjusting to a military lifestyle and allows your superiors to do something about it with something black and white. It does not leave a mark on your records."

People need to stop encouraging behavior like this, simple as that. Otherwise they become enablers who allow people like OP to drift through life thinking they're sick when they're not.

But what does everyone do? They suck it up and go on with life instead of complaining how special they used to be. The sooner op gets over this stage the better. Pretty sure an overwhelming majority of the middle class have a low self worth given how oppressing things can be over here.

You either get on with it and become a contributing member of society or fall by the wayside. Its just how the society is programmed unfortunately.

And to add on, yes, the things I'm saying might be very harsh and insensitive but if it helps op become a functioning member of society instead of falling by the wayside by getting diagnosed with a mental illness that I'm glad that it was said. "
d718j32,BRuiden69,"I dont really get how you are assuming that everyone is just going to simply suck it up.It sounds really selfish of you to label those who are going through depression as people who simply cannot contribute to society while they are depressed,since depression is usually something that never fully does away and you are essentially calling these people's lives worthless.Honestly,you sound like one of those teachers with no experience who think that every kid if the same hence uses the same teaching methods on everyone,ostracizing the less gifted ones.I guess your opinions are a result of how you were brought up,but only the strongest survive is a old way of thinking that doesnt take into account the changes to our society.Those who suffer from mental problems are an asset to our society depending on how we handle them,but your attitude represents the one of Singaporeans who think they have seen it all and neither understand nor try to understand those who are different.I just hope that one day when you have experienced more,you wont regret being part of something which causes the mentally ill to want to negatively impact society instead of contributing to it."

clbmtio,dashrandom,"The reasons why many businesses fold in their first year of operations is because or bosses like these. You'll actually be surprised how common this behaviour is, so many people go into businesses with the notion of turning a profit (P.s. Not breaking even but actually going into the green) within the first 2 years. 

I've experienced a startup that is somewhat similar. When it comes to bosses attitude on things. When you place money instead of the well being of your employees first as a startup, you're doing it wrong. Money is important but the important thing about start ups is that they need to grow. To grow you need to retain talent. Behaving like this only scares potentially good employees away.

I don't think you have to worry much because large firms aren't all like your start up experience. There are proper procedures in place and all. "
clbqpl0,mrdoriangrey,"> **Was just wondering whether this is basically what working life is like and how SG managers usually are?**

You will meet horrible bosses and fantastic ones. It's the same everywhere, really. I've read/heard similar tales from people in China, USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Germany, Uruguay. It's not a Singapore thing.

I suppose the F&B industry is a lot worse off because smaller restaurants/cafes have to make ends meet. Also, the culture here is horrible for part-timers - little benefits and accountability.

I can assure you that things *generally* get better once you're a full-time professional.

> **Please be frank about whether I'm being too idealistic in expecting businesses to be run more ethically/optimally.**

Again, this isn't a Singapore-specific thing. Smaller businesses tend to go for profits because they fly under the radar easily and the profit goes directly to the owner.

So yes, if you're preparing to work for a start-up/smaller company in the future, there is a good chance that you will face similar issues."

I had some managers from hell who I dreaded seeing in morning, and others I became close friends with. Working life is not so different from other places except perhaps the intensity.

However, everything that happened within the business was up to ethical standards. Especially for an F&B outlet, not adhering to health regulations is pretty terrible. Not to say that there are no businesses who do it but if I were you I'd inform the relevant authorities about it."

You've probably also heard the phrase - ""As long as you don't get caught, it's okay."" and those are probably the phrases that govern the actions of many people these days. I wouldn't say you should expect every manager to be like that - I'd like to think there are still ethical ones around (makes it slightly easier living here)."
clbx3bn,Walaneh,"Can you elaborate on ""corner cutting behaviour"" which doesn't pass govt regulations? I'm curious. 

"
clbps0w,MeowgicTheCathering,"Any form of work which has a set of regulations to follow is going to break those rules one way or another. The only question is how often and to what extent. The reason for this is that regulations are written for an idealised world, whereas in reality things are rarely as clearcut and defined. It's simply not feasible to follow regulations closely and be efficient at the same time. There's a ""by right"" way to do things and a ""by left"" way.

dv1jxdl,aahfeekiee,"I dropped out of year 3 architecture course in poly because of anxiety + dire financial issues, then enlisted and now working part time until I get my results for reapplication into poly. 

There are plenty of jobs out there, entry level ones with low starting pay. Among these I have had jobs I enjoy, at hawker stalls, bubble tea kiosks, and also retail, where my bosses just so happened to be kind and understanding. 

On the opposite side of the spectrum I've also worked in blue-collar type jobs like housekeeping, where managers exploit their manpower, shout and curse at staff for minor mistakes and regularly schedule them for many many hours of unpaid overtime as punishment. 

I've also worked in pyramid schemes that often perpetuate the idea of ""get rich without going to school!!!"" that has really only worked for people at the top of the pyramid. These jobs are all definitely there, but there's more disadvantages to them then just a meagre salary.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that just because you don't expect a fabulous salary and an extravagant lifestyle, doesnt mean that your entry level job cannot can find a way to screw you over. By no means would I say that it is not possible to be happy with life getting by on an entry-level job, it's just that one can't *expect* just about any one of them to make you happy.

When you're talking about two things that change together, in this case (reading and writing) vs (improving English skill), you use the phrase ""the more"" twice.

You could try playing games with more text in them. For example, role-playing games (RPGs) tend to have a lot of dialogue. You could try playing games for younger people, like Pokemon, because the English used would be simpler. You can also try reading comics, since they don't have as much text as books. I think the most important thing is to learn from something that you find fun or interesting.

For the amount of time to spend each day, start small, like 15 minutes a day. Then increase the amount of time when you feel more comfortable. 

I'm learning Japanese from scratch. I practice mainly by reading comics and trying to understand song lyrics. I have a dictionary app on my phone to refer to. Maybe this would work for you.

Hi, I have problems with my English. I can't write or speak well. I graduated in 2012 and found an engineering job in 2013. After a year, I was depressed, could not sleep well and felt upset that I could not finish my work on time. I could not construct proper sentences for replying emails, writing reports and creating presentations. I started to stay at home every weekend and disliked talking with others. Recently, I quit my job and found a new one as a technician. I feel that I am very useless, as I have a degree but am doing the work of a technician. I feel sad most of the time. I try to make an effort to read something new everyday, but I just can't do it and feel like playing games instead. I don't know how to help myself. I also cannot express myself well. Can anyone help me? There is no one I can talk to. My husband can't help me as well. 

\-

Like what the rest of the folks here have been saying, my advice to you would be to try to relax a little. I know you are frustrated and anxious to improve, but small steps really do go a long way. Getting a good tutor might help a lot, and help you moderate your progress. I hope we have been of some help to you as a starting point. Good luck! :)"

In your second line, you have the correct idea, but *memories* are the noun form of memory. It is the thing that you keep in your mind, not the action of keeping it. You memorise (verb form) memories.

Have you considered going back to the basics? There is no shame and there shouldn't be any shame in approaching a language you are weak at from less difficult level.

Most of these are just tenses.

cn3c7qd,jumpforjoy_,"Hey there :) Just a question, is english your first language? Well, yeah I understand how you feel. It definitely feels terrible. 

Mm in my opinion, for languages (English especially) it doesn't really help to do workbook exercises once you've picked up the basic skills (spelling, reading, basic grammar).  What I feel may be more effective is to interact with English on a daily basis. In that way you'll slowly begin to ""know"" how a sentence should flow, or what forms of a word should be used :) oh I  think previous posters might have said this but: watch some shows, listen to music, read a few books which interest you. What kind of shows/books/music/games do you like? Mystery? Romance? Action? I can try to recommend some English forms of those :) 

What do you do at your current job? So sorry if you already said so in your post, I'm replying this on my phone so can't open it. Don't be too harsh on yourself for what you can't do: I believe that rephrasing things is a step more difficult, because you have to understand, then simplify the words.

The best way is getting into things you like; movies, shows, books and games.

He said that the best way to improve is to find something you're interested in and use that to improve your English and his example was porno and nudie magazines lol.

I gave two, well-documented, reasons why it appears the abuse is systemic, structural, in the sense that the structure of the work contract and their access to conflict resolution is limited. I understand that additional structures such as the one you mention exist, to address violence in the family and potentially towards helpers. There remains issues that some are not paid correctly, or are not granted the vacation days they are due, at minimum, sometimes worse. Compound this with their limited access to conflict resolution and this is why I argue that despite the low numbers, it is still a systemic problem. I am not sure that your “whataboutism” argument and demeaning my own points is a valid response."

e57cwf2,samglit,"You say well documented without providing citations, which I have been careful to do.

What is “some”? Just because there is a power disparity does not automatically make something “systemic”.  Are NS trainees systemically abused by their trainers, or is it failure of individual management?  Are wives systemically abused by husbands in single income households?

It’s not “whataboutism” to question definitions of terms that are not consistently applied to similar circumstances.

Are you aware of the education on rights provided to incoming FDW by their respective governments AND the Singapore one?"
e5798w5,Alucardeus,funny tho the article hardly touch anything about abuse of maid but instead Myanmar government wanted to fix their salary to minimum of $450 and 1 off days and therefore ban them from coming to Singapore unless they get these benefits. If it is more focus on Abuse of the maid received then maybe it is having bad reputation. The other countries like Philippines and Indonesia also did not banned their maid from coming into singapore 
e57b7eu,jeding250250,"The fact that they have to shows they're being abused. Indonesia and Philippines already have a minimum wage and Indonesia is [protecting their migrants that travel to Singapore.](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/bond-imposed-indonesian-embassy-hiring-maids-unnecessary-mom) and [the source for minimum wage](http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/higher-pay-indonesian-maids-next-year)



For Philippines they also have a [minimum wage](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/minimum-pay-raised-for-filipino-maids-here)

It's likely that if they didn't get their minimum wage followed they would ban Singapore as the most common abuse of helpers is salary issues(refusing to pay, late payments)

d82m2hm,Jhocx,"This gonna be long. 

Hey there. Am a fellow retainee here that graduated 2 years back. What I shall do is to try to share with you my experience and some tips that helped me through. 

You ask what should your next course of action be. In the short term you should probably focus on your pw, if I recall correctly the after promos period is the final leg of pw submission, so work hard w your group mates on that! Try to get a good result for pw, since it's going to reflect on your cert and it's one subject you won't have to worry about anymore afterwards. It's going to be hard, but until you get your results there's not much point worrying too much about your promo results, try to shelf away the sadness and focus on pw first. 

Like I said, not easy, but you gotta try. 

Subsequently when you receive your results and if you find out that you are retaining, it will suck, no bullshitting you there. I'm a guy and I cried by eyes out at home secretly. It's ok to feel sad but it's more important to pick yourself up. 

""Why do we fall? So we may learn to pick ourselves up"" 

Yes, Batman, but this quote made me believe that my retaining could be a good thing in disguise, if I look past all the negatives, and more importantly if I work hard to make it so. 

Several things you gotta do to do better next year
Identify why you got poor grades this year, was it a distraction, was it poor study techniques, was it plain laziness? Identify your factors and change it. Mine was a combination of cca and an addiction to computer gaming, and after I retained it was a huge wake up call, I quit computer gaming for my remaining years in Jc and I worked w my cca teacher, if I don't finish my work, I won't get to take part in my cca. 

It is also important to pay attention in lectures, and complete your tutorials. I used to just sleep through lectures and not do my tutorials, but minimally you should at least fill in your notes during lectures and finish your tutorials for class. If home is unproductive, try to finish your work before heading home each day. It helps in your second year that you no longer take pw and have that few extra hours to do your work while your new peers are in pw lessons. 

Next, on coping w the social pressure, friends etc. honestly, I think retainees judge themselves more than anybody else judge them. Yes I have met some teachers that truly believe retainees are scum (but that just made me more resilient in proving them wrong), but honestly your friends don't care and your new peers won't too. You just got to believe that. 

At the end of the day, an extra year is nothing. At age 18+, it might seem like the end of the world, but in the real world no one really cares that you're one year older with an A level cert. it's more important to get your good grades, and make this year worth it. 

Personally, I believe retaining allowed me to achieve decent grades that I wouldn't have been able to get if I promoted, due to a weak foundation etc. I have had fellow struggling friends that promoted while I retained, and yeah they went ahead to finish their Jc in 2 years but sadly couldn't achieve the results they wanted.

Feel free to Pm me if you need any more help, but jia you OP, it's definitely not the end of the world, many like myself have walked this path. (: "

d82jq5g,doc-tom,Keep your chin up. The average Singaporean will live until 80+. You have more than 60 years of life before you. Being retained for 1 year is not a big deal. 
d82pm1l,anonretained,"My friend retained

After his promos he literally shut down

First thing he did when he got home was to print a picture of Oxford's crest and paste it on the wall infront of his study table

He skipped school,CCA, everthing that was unnecessary  and simply studied at home for the entire holidays, only going to school for lessons. He skipped all PW meetings and only turned up for OP, he didn't give a fuck about PW whatsoever (he felt that the amount of time he spent PW was a contributing factor to his grades).

He aced the next 2 years, applied to oxford for PPE and got in

Moral of story being, get read to slog your ass off, it is possible to succeed and beat 99.99999% of the cohort even if you retain, even those that got into NUS medicine school/law school whatever "
d82k39c,_hazy_future_,"Read this story I found on writing prompts the other day. It's a story about regret and mistakes. Hopefully you can gain the same insights I had to help you with your dilemma.

d82k1g3,yihui86,"Go out for some fresh air and do some things you truly enjoy doing (i.e gaming, exercise). Honestly, you should not think too much on getting retained when you have not even receive the actual exam results. Who knows, you might scrap a pass for your paper.

In the worst case scenario, hopefully you will perceive it to be a good wake up call and a precious 'second chance' for you to do well again.

Don't give up."
d82lfj3,Sapphiresin,"If you retain, you better buck up. In the grand scheme of things, 1 or 2 years don't make a difference. We all end up in society, some NT/NA/Express, some JC/Poly/ITE, you +1 year here -1 year there in the end nobody really cares anymore.  

Just make sure everything goes uphill from there. You can do it.  

Dropping out is also an option, although I don't know enough about it to say much."
d82o0c3,Axewhy,Back when I was in JC the two retainees in my class were very chill and helpful people. They probably studied like crazy after being retained and we treated them like gods as they were the go to person whenever we didn't understand anything. 
d82kmzw,,"i dropped out after the first year because i couldn't enjoy the life there without my cca (stupid school rules about leaving council if you retain). 


but i have a few friends from different jc retain and then took the extra year to really build their foundation and eventually do pretty well for As. there're some who went for the 2nd try and really put in effort but to no avail. 


I think as long as you are truthfully certain about what the problem was (lack of time, didn't understand lessons, wasn't putting effort, etc) then youll have your answer if you should retain. The worst thing is to retain/dropout because you don't know why you're doing so. "
d82m5gl,ignoredtillendoftime,"Using my throwaway account here, I am currently a J2 studying in one of JC. I retained too in J1 and I can tell you that it isnt that bad. You have an extra year to study and it really helps a lot. But you must make sure you take advantage of the extra year. Honestly, if this extra year can lead you to getting into the course you want, I find it to be worthwhile. It is better to graduate with straight A then straight C. Use your experiences in your first year to help you better understand what methods of studying work for you and you can do better in your second year. Who knows, maybe you retained and eventually score straight A in all your subjects and get into a prestigious course like law or medicine. There isnt such thing as failure in life, there are only lessons to be learned. I took this extra year positively and I forged a lot more friendships and really improved on my academic results by quite a big margin. But that is for me and as for you, whether you are happy or have success is in your grasp."
d82mhlf,Acrux99,"If you are a girl, don't worry take it as a life lesson and study hard next year you still will be ahead of guys who got 2 year NS. If you are a guy, Fuck yeah! 1 more year of NS deferment. We all make mistakes, don't give up."
d82nmsc,Bellcurvegod,Retaining isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. The A levels were meant to be a 3 year program anyway.
d82o59n,NEUERDAWALL,"Your fellow batchmate here (I retained last year). Honestly, I would tell you that retaining isn't something that you should look at too negatively. Since you think you're already gonna retain, I'd suggest you concentrate hard on your PW these next few weeks to come, while at the same time coming to terms with your situation now. While you may be motivated to rush a lot of work in these one or two months, I'd suggest you not do so as you might burn out and it'll turn out worse for you next year. 

When get back to school next year, keep an open mind. Make new friends- they'll be important to you in the time to come. Try not to make the same mistakes as you did the previous year- like falling asleep in lectures and all that stuff. Look for your teachers for consultation for stuff that you're not clear in. You can also ask your friends in J2 for advice (that's what I did and it helped me a lot). 

While you may think that it's a year wasted, trust me, you'll still be better off than advancing to J2 and having no idea what's going on. This one year will help you build a proper foundation so once you go into J2, you'll have an easier time and can focus less on the J1 topics

Don't be too down and good luck! "
d83gpe7,light8686,"Sometimes a wake-up call is necessary for your future. I failed my Math for 'O' Level and went to ITE. My relatives judged me and said some nasty words about me going to ITE.

Subsequently, I went to Poly (Direct 2nd Year) after my NS with my ITE grade. After which, I went to NTU and graduated with a 3rd class honors. I hold a decent job and  pretty contented with life. If I went to Poly directly after my 'O' Level, I will not even consider for University.

d83wj36,Darkless69,"I took an extra year, repeating J2. Got straight Us for prelims in the first year. Second year managed to get into a ABC course in NTU. 

Don't give a shit about what others say about retaining. It's frowned upon by both students and the school. If you spend your time wisely, you can do much better. Granted there's little chance of getting straight As, at least you can get a spot in local Unis.

Do the tutorials during lectures. Do the TYS during tutorials. Consult teachers from day 1. Do prelim papers as much as possible. TLDR: do it and make every day count"

d8469n1,medicboy104,"Don't worry bro, time will heal all wounds and you will survive. 

I personally know 2 people that retained that ended up in medical school. One of them even retained in Sec 4 and it was really traumatic for him seeing all his friends go on to JC (IP school) while he was stuck in Sec 4. Yet, he continued along and now is going to be a doctor. 

It's all about your attitude. Just give it your best shot the next 2 years and make sure you leave JC with no regrets. Channel your emotions into your work and remember that in the end, you are not defined by your grades, job or achievements. You are valuable just because of who you are. Godspeed. "
d82kt7x,alphygian,"Retaining is not bad. My JC had a pretty high retention rate and no one (afaik) looks down on retainees, if you're worried about that. If you end up retaining, it's literally a second chance at JC so make sure to fix what you've been doing wrong. Most retainees I know do well eventually for A's. "
d82q530,decamarkers,"Take this with a pinch of salt since i'm not a retainee, my promos are still ongoing.

Retaining honestly isn't that big of a deal and if you ask me might actually be beneficial. Now don't get me wrong i'm not saying you should slack but some people just need more time to cope with the extensive syllabus in JC. As others have mentioned, this might also be the wake up call you need. My class has 2 retainees and both of them are actually doing at least above average academically.

In any case, even if you retain don't give up hope OP. The extra one year can actually help you quite a bit. I for one would actually prefer a 3 year course for JC seeing how much content there is to master."

once you get past the trainee/recruit stage and get into a unit, you technically have your own ""bunk"" where you can stay in, even during the weekends: just choose simply not to book out.

talk to your future superiors, let them know of your issue, army can easily let you have a living space when you are a regular, your food/clothing/accomodations will all be covered and you can easily save up money. if you are lucky, there are overseas posting available too (you get extra money for it)

if not, you are looking at 2 very hard years ahead of you where you are pretty much stagnant financially. cheapest rent possible is to stay with overseas uni students where you can share a flat and expect to pay 600-700 per month (at current rate that is, 2 yrs later should go up cos of inflation)"

* Learn to shut out your parents and live off them with free rent till you have earn enough money

* Find a job, but in Singapore you might not have alot of money to take back after rent,bills,food and many others

* Sign on, free housing and good pay

Since you suggested that moving out is a ""must-do"" I would suggest you start saving now and I hope you realise how much you might have to fork out for your own place. A quick search I did and most 1 rooms come out to about $800. Poly grad earn max 1.7 ""give you the best chance"" $1700- $800(rent)-$350(food)-$100 (bills) = $450. "

cq4yqsy,Barfwarf,"Hi OP,

As much as I would love to tell you to sign on like everyone else , I don't think they will accept you because of your mental issues. But give it a go if you really consider doing it, 

Pros of signing on
- They feed you with everything you need.
- you can even earn extras over the weekends.
(current NSFs and NSmen will know what i mean)
- Pay is fucking good.

Cons
- you'll practically lose out on social life.
 Meaning if you don't have a girlfriend now, it'll be super duper difficult for you to find one, unless you're those kind that chiong every wednesday, friday - sunday, or actively searching for one now.

Those are my opinion if you want to sign on,

Another way you can deal with it is to face it head on, talk things out with your family. I don't know if it'll work for you, but as a middle kid in my family, I'll always feel that my parents are venting their anger on me because of my older siblings and my younger siblings are always getting pampered. Until one day I shouted at them how I really feel, things got better. 
I'm not asking you to shout at them, but try talking to them nicely, explain to them that you're emotionally hurt deeply and that you're also human, regardless whether you're adopted or not. 

Running away from home in Singapore is so damn not practical, simply because rents are so fucking high.
If you're seriously planning to run, try talking to some of your closer friends, if you have a girlfriend, try talking to her as well. I believe if you're good to your friends in poly, they won't watch you die, unless you're those kind of quite CB one, then i don't think anyone will want to help. 

That is all that i can say for now. I really hope you can really sort things out with your family."

I got no choice haizz,I do not have money to go private poly because it is very expensive,secondly it is not recognize in companies when you apply for job in the future, I have managed to have a peace of mind until my father constantly started to mocked at me again and always looked down on me as usual. my parents almost everyday always finding fault with me because they see me always no happy but what can I do?and it make me temporary depressed at that time but not anymore as I have changed for the better and more motivated to better in life in the future. I am being in enlisted in a couple of months time, after my NS, I want to rent a room also? Reason?

Take my ADVICE, Do not SIGN ON just for RICE BOWL,UNLESS you really got passion in SAF, after NS then get a full time job, then from there work hard.

cq3nm4x,aerir25,"+1

1. Start saving up to get the necessities (a cheapo laptop for job hunting, office wears, etc) OR negotiate with your family to get a few thousands dollars as your kickstart fund for leaving the family (this means burning the bridge with them)
2. Find a job before you move out 
3. Move to somewhere nearer to your workplace to cut off travelling time
4. Share a room instead of paying for full rent, save at least 300$


Living in Singapore is actually not that expensive (for single and without any commitment), the biggest expenses will be from your accommodation and food. 


When you save enough, take up a degree or get certified to be tradesman (if you are handy). When there's a will, there's a way.

As time passes in secondary sch, you will also slowly find out who your true buddies are. 

Remember, suicide is never worth it. So much more to experience in your life at this young age. 

Are you doing your part to be close to your family? 

"
e8sm5e9,theinventorguy,"I believe you are an introvert. Do understand you do not need to be friends with everyone around you. People who bully are assholes, simple as. Like you, I am not close to family and I do not have many friends. However, unlike you, I am perfectly fine being alone. Having said that, I am much older than you are. I eat alone all the time, since my teenage years. Next time you see someone dining alone, think of what you think of that person. Probably nothing, because it means just that - nothing. Go pick up this book called 'Quiet' by Susan Cain. It will help you understand yourself better. If you need to share something, always revisit the internet. You will realize you are hardly alone in how you feel. "

e8spp37,onelastsalute,"Hey man, I was like you too. Surrounded by people but lonely as fuck. I didn't find good friends till like sec 3. It gets better.

Focus on yourself, explore interests and find something you love. Music brought me to get to know some of my closest friends in secondary school. You're more important than anyone else, remember that."
e8soitt,UnsolicitedFishball,"It seems like worrying about finding friends is excerbating your anxieties. Imagine trying to float on water, the brain panics and thinks thrashing about helps, ironically causing you to sink and leads to even more thrashing, like how being anxious about trying not to be anxious creates a never ending loop. If it seems like nothing is working then maybe you can stop trying to find a solution, and by that i don't mean committing suicide because that's technically a solution (albeit a bad one), i mean practice bringing the mind to the present moment and away from ruminations."
e8t02pj,0percentile,"I used to have this problem too, and I realised that in secondary school, kids may be young and unreasonable, and they can have irrational dislikes for even nice people like you! Heck, my schoolmates used to shit on even the nicest students for stupid reasons like changing their facebook profile picture all the time.

You can learn to appreciate your own company :) I realised that having so many friends can be tiring emotionally, and I’ve been disappointed and betrayed so many times by these “friends”, 

There’s nothing wrong to be all by yourself. Yes, it gets lonely and depressing sometimes. But if anything, I find that people who depend on themselves emotionally are very strong."

e8u8vhv,thexynapse,"I'll leave a couple thoughts in this comment. I don't know how old you are, I'm 16 so maybe you'd be more comfortable with someone around your age.

Everything will pass. Finding a hobby or something to do is really important. It sucks now, but embrace the suck. It sounds stupid I know, but every time you feel down, use that to motivate yourself. Prove them wrong. I remember at the end of sec 2, I felt like a failure. So many things I wanted to do, I couldn't because my grades sucked. I felt like a failure, why does everyone else have it easier than me?

I felt surrounded by people but alone at the same time. Don't worry about how people view you, they probably don't even notice. When you go to a mall, you probably didn't notice other people. So why would they notice you?

If you're getting bullied, please tell a teacher or your parents. I read that your parents treat you like you're 4. That's normal.

Normally, I find that social anxiety is caused by insecurity.Is it with your weight? Because that was the case for me. So I decided to stop lazing around and get over it. I lost weight, and I'm feeling better than before. If anyone ever looks down on you, prove them wrong. Set a goal, and keep pushing towards it. Don't stop going till you succeed. 

You're the main character of your own story. So you decide whether your story is going to be one you like or detest. 

"
e8wdl5p,gabeytong,"Hey dude, know what you're going through, used to be a fucking loser in sec 1 and 2 myself (am 18 now) , I believe you're probably socially inept, and yeah dude it totally sucks that you can't click with anyone in your school, I think the best course of action for you is to find a hobby and make some friends through there and develop your social skills, sinkies are fucked up and will ostracize anybody different from them, so try to make friends outside, go exercise, go find a cool hobby and make some friends outside dude."

e8tioxn,jxxlius,"Personally, I’ve had issues with making friends and acquaintances due to the bare fact that I’ve always thought I wouldn’t ever meet people’s expectations of me. You’ve gotta find friends that accept you for who you are, not just use you as a laughing gag, and siam away if you’ve got problems to deal with. 

Anyway, if you ever need someone to talk to, just drop a PM alright? Suicide is never the answer. There are always people who are willing to smother you with love and affection for days on end. 

Take care, friend. Everything will be alright. ✌🏽"

e8tkouw,Acrux99,"The only way to be more social is to socialise more. Easier said than done right? All O can say is you need to make that first step to being who you want to be. Yes 20years down the road Sec school wont even matter but here and now, it is very difficult to go through. My advise to you, join more CCAs, make it a habit to adopt a healthy lifestyle (sleep early and excercise) and just talk to people. Well maybe not random strangers on trains but the person seating at the desk beside you or infront of you. Ask them about their weekend and what they did and just listen. People lile to talk (brag) so as long as you have good listening skills its a small step towards socialising. Good luck."
e8tmleh,LittleEel,"Take the time to learn more about yourself - the good & the bad - and very importantly do work on being a better person and be comfortable with yourself. It takes sheer discipline and you may stumble – don’t beat yourself up too much during those times and keep moving forward. Your future self will thank you for being disciplined and treating yourself with self-care.

On another note… Secondary school tends to be like this. Don’t sweat it. I too got bullied a hell lot too, struggled and ultimately I’m still living in one piece :-)

You can talk to people on the internet but of course be wary, and never stop learning about the different types of people out there without judgement.

Godspeed to you, mate."
e8tmu1q,danielling1981,"I'll focus on the part where you treat people with respect but not received.

Firstly. Welcome to the world.

Where everything is not necessarily in sequence 12345.

What I'm trying to say is that, things that we expect may not necessarily happen.

It may or may not be you. But even adults encounter this.
Say good morning, say hi, say bye. Courteously, brightly, positively, you name it.
But you can get nothing. Nothing, no acknowledgement whatsoever.

But that's life and society in it's natural state.
Move on.

Tldr: it's society. May or may not be due to you.
You may do the bestest and rightest and still get nothing.


Now as for whether it's you.

Nobody will be able to answer this question as no one here knows you.

e8uk7ab,perfold7,"Hey man, 

I understand what you're going through, believe me I really do. I want to remind you of one thing though, some kids our age can be pretty immature at times. They might do stupid shit and not think of consequences, it's just that way. Perhaps they don't realise what they're doing and how it affects you. I understand it sucks, it's annoying. Sometimes you'll feel like giving up but you need to persevere. One day your peers will grow up and they probably won't be as ignorant as they are now.  

Good luck my man, and if you ever need help you can look for me (pm me bro)"
e8uxh4n,BleachedShoe,"I used to think why I don't have many friends back then. Then I came to realise it might not necessarily be a good thing. Friends will come and go. But maintaining your friendship is another thing. I learned not to solely rely on friends as sometimes you can grow out of your friendship even though you have spent your entire primary/secondary/poly years with them. If you are not a social butterfly, its okay not to be. 

I get teased oftenly by my friends during secondary sch as well. Eg. Fat, overweight, sleeping-beauty, emo, uncaring, unfriendly, throat cancer. 
Secondary school can be a bitch really. Since it is the time when we get to learn and explore more about our bodies and self.

I eat alone during my lunchtimes and I'm perfectly fine with it. I actually prefer it. I know some people would see people who alone as loners but truth is, we enjoy it. I enjoy it. 

When I'm with friends, it becomes another thing. There is this.. unseen peer pressure, both positive and negative effects.

 I enjoy the benefits of other company however, I prefer to be alone at times. I've watched movies alone, eaten alone, went shopping alone. Its actually been quite insightful for myself.

About the friends part, i used to think that the friends around me are just fake and toxic ppl but in actual fact i have came to realised that not all of them are like that. there may be some ppl around u who are genuinely concern abt u too, just that they express it clearly and sometimes they may “hide” under some jokes that may seem as mean or hateful to u 
i would say go with the flow, this period will pass by very soon! In the meanwhile try to talk to ur parents more, share with them about little incidents that happened and grow closer to them! Ur parents may be treating u as a 4 yr old because they dont know who u rly are, so show them u are not that little kid anymore!!

e8uab9o,thexynapse,"If it's because of your weight, then they're terrible people. Playful joking is fine, but if you express that you're very uncomfortable with the jokes, they just immediately stop. As to the one expression part, I guess you just have to smile more. It sounds stupid, but with happiness, fake it till you make it sometimes works. Just smiling will eventually cause you to smile subconsciously, and that will make you happier. I'm no doctor so I can't tell you how it works, it just does."
e8srqda,aexlle,"What i realize.. when i was in sec 1/2 i didnt really think twice on watever i said to ppl.. but as i grew older and influenced from my mum (to be polite, think of ppl feelings).. i started thinking twice and realize the coversations i have with my friends didnt felt like ""close friends"" type of conversations anymore cos i am always thinking twice at everything i say.. Which will cause conversations among friends to be boring cause i was always making sure i dun offend them in any way.. It became more formal than fun which made me start to realize.. it was harder for me to find friends when i started to have that habit..

Of course, im not saying that being rude/insensitive is the way to go lOL.. but like when we say someone is our friend, we should be able to talk freely wif no restriction/compromise/no trouble to chat wif them.. rather than thinking should i say this? nahh will offend them etcetc.

And i understand, there will always be cliques in sec sch.. if some ppl are in neither, some may feel left out etc.. so as what other redditors recommend, volunteer, meet new ppl. Friends doesnt have to be those among ur age.. Or do not think that u need a group of friends.. instead having 1 close friend is the best. 

Or find a hobby, search for ppl who does it too. maybe ur not-yet friend is interested too but dk yet nia hahah.

All in all, dun feel discouraged. You have yet to explore so many things. Dun let this affect you too much. All the best! we're always here for you :))"
e8shfbi,banniemd2b,"maybe you just need to find people who like the stuff you do, EVA or pokemon etc

e8tohx7,Remiskawaii,"I cannot tell or judge solely from your post. But the way I see it, if you arent a shit to people yet people still stray away from you, you probably are just socially awkward. Ie. arent behaving ""properly""or ""normally"" as the other people.

I have had classmates who arent shitheads yet no one talks to them because they just ""don't invite interaction"". For instance, there was this nice classmate who sat beside me but he barely talks, only talking when the teacher calls him. I didnt ignore him lr anything but I didnt exactly make friends with him either.

I cant say for sure whats the problem, because only people around you would know. Whether or not someone will tell you, thats another thing. Of course, if you arent interested in making friends, none of the above would matter.

However, if you really want to make friends casually in school, you have to realise its not just about being nice. You have to be ""inviting to talk to"" as well.

Like the other guy said, friendships take time to form, you don't have to rush it. I understand that you feel alone, I have been there too. Forcing friendships will only make it worse, you'll end up making friends with people who may make use of you or aren't truthful.

I suggest not to drop out because based on my experience, as I get older my motivation to study decreases. (Im also on my last sem, thank god) "

dlqf8ig,Operadrama,"I’lll probably skip the advice on how to ace in your poly studies since you have already mention countless time your loss of motivation to study, I would tell you that you best bet is to give yourself a chance to see if you like serving army = sign on as full time. I don’t think it’s a terrible idea despite people saying so many cons about it but I’m thinking it might work well for you if you are thinking of skipping a diploma certification. You’ll have a clearer picture of what you’ll want to do with your life as time passes but right now your primary focus should be having a job right after your completion of your NS to support yourself while you reconsider if you want to pursue a private diploma in the future.  One of my galfriend was a top scorer at Higher Nitec together with me and we moved on to NP for a business Diploma but she  dropped out after the first year because she showed no interest to study too. Today she’s got a job of her dream working as a childcare centre helper, so not too bad for her, at least she’s happy with her life right now. Don't stress too hard over this, follow your guts and go with the flow. Good luck ! "
dlpthrq,kkkanojo,"i have friends who encountered similar situations before and i am also experiencing something similar (lack of interest in poly)

my ite => poly friend dropped out at the end of year one and went straight to work (since he had connections in his desired field)

one of my other poly coursemates dropped and is now floating until next year to get another course

as for me im just struggling not to fail, but i think i have enough intership things on my resume to grab at least one job

these examples, i hope you can make use of them if you intend to drop out, but make sure you have a route to follow when you do, because it will backfire on you. graduate with full time diploma is more worth then juggling job + part time diploma"

>I'm really fine, it's just benzos and all after all. I have many 420-friendly people around me and we do just fine, but I'm just afraid of the people who are perhaps addicted to opiates and the such, and really do need help but are totally ignored. It's unfortunate that we view these people as the perpetrators instead of victims, so fuck that mentality.  
Such a mentality is akin to being born with cerebral palsy and getting mocked at, ""Eh, you got palsy you deserve it lah fuck off"". I have to use such an extreme example because it is exactly what addiction is like, it's like cerebral palsy or related afflictions, they're something we really cannot control.  
So to those mightier than thou people here, the next time you're doing volunteer work and meet people who are perhaps mentally stunted from birth or from age, we are the same. It's not something that we can consciously control. With the similar amount of love that you provide to the former group of people (and please do continue showering your love to them), that same amount or less of that love towards us may make more of a difference than you imagine.  
Unfortunately, this is Singapore, and it is much easier to shun drug users than to understand and help them.
I do hope that one day Singapore will be tolerant towards us, and realise that it's an affliction that we do not want, and help us instead of treating us like the leper that we are not. Having one's psyche messed up by drugs is bad enough, you do not want to affect said person's psyche while they are sober.  
So, if you know of anyone in a similar situation, do offer to help, do offer to lend a listening ear, do offer to be there. It'll make a whole world of difference. Inaction on a friend's/relative's/lover's part would constitute as much fault as the drug addict harming oneself. Many a times we just need someone to talk to, and we can temporarily pass on our cravings for whatever drug we're hooked on to.  
Here's to a more open and understanding community :)

Copied my reply to it here:

>Being *born* with a condition and making the *choice* to consume those kind of drugs are very different things. Yes, you cannot (or rather it's incredibly difficult to) control your addiction, but what got you addicted in the first place was your *choice*. So please, PLEASE, stop having that **victim mentality**, because if you keep thinking that you're the **victim** and that you need other people to help you out of the hole you dug yourself in, how then will you take full responsibility of your predicament and realize that ultimately you have to want to help yourself? Only when you put the onus on yourself to kick the addiction can other people help you the most effectively.  
So, I'm telling you to tell yourself to fuck that victim mentality of yours. I'm pretty sure things will get better after that and I hope you share my optimism :)

you make reasoned points (if somewhat emotive), but likely as it is, the people downvoting you won't give half a fuck about having a reasonable discussion with you. as it is, you come off as bitter, with a severe axe to grind that a topic you have strong feelings about isn't being taken as seriously as you'd like the rest of the subreddit to."

drgokah,rsg-retrivr,"> #Tampines double deaths: Married man kills ex-girlfriend before jumping to his death

> SINGAPORE - Unable to move on after their affair ended early this year, a married man killed his former girlfriend in her flat before jumping to his death from the 10th-storey unit, a court heard on Tuesday (Dec 19).

> Safety supervisor Chng Hong Nam, 49, was found dead at the foot of the block of flats at around 11pm on May 29. When police officers went up to Ms Serinn Tan Bee Leng&apos;s home at Block 520A, Tampines Central 8, they saw the sales telemarketer lying motionless on a blood-soaked bed.

> In an inquiry into their deaths, Senior Investigation Officer Vicneswaran Ramakrishnan told the court that Ms Tan, 46, died from a stab wound in her chest and two in her abdomen.

> She also had cuts on her forearms, believed to be defensive wounds when Mr Chng attacked her with a ""knife-like weapon"". The weapon used to kill her has not been recovered.

> The father of three first met Ms Tan about four years ago when he was working as a property agent.

> They got involved in a relationship and tried to keep it discreet, but Mr Chng&apos;s wife later found out about it.

> She asked her husband to stop seeing Ms Tan and even went to the divorcee&apos;s flat to confront her. When confronted, Ms Tan denied that she was in a relationship with Mr Chng.

> On Tuesday, SIO Vicneswaran told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that the affair ended early this year, and Ms Tan got into a relationship with another married man, who was her supervisor at work.

> Despite this, Mr Chng still contacted Ms Tan as he wanted to meet her, but she always made excuses to avoid him.

> The pair agreed to meet at her Tampines home on May 29 and Mr Chng later jumped to his death after stabbing her.

> Residents alerted the police, and officers who found Ms Tan&apos;s NRIC in Mr Chng&apos;s possession went up to her flat. They found her lying face up on a bed, with stab wounds, as well as bruises around her wrists and ankles.

> SIO Vicneswaran said Mr Chng could have restrained the woman with some cable ties, as they were found at the foot of the block.

> Neighbours the officers spoke to said they did not hear any suspicious sounds coming from the unit that evening.

> SIO Vicneswaran said this was because Mr Chng, who was bigger in built than Ms Tan, could have gagged his former girlfriend before stabbing her.

> He added that Mr Chng sent a message to his wife and jumped off the 10th-storey balcony.

> In the message, read out in court on Tuesday, Mr Chng apologised to his family members and stated that he was ""not a good father"".

> Ms Tan&apos;s sister and parents were in court, but they declined to comment when approached by The Straits Times. The coroner will give her findings on Jan 19 next year.

drgq03o,bookworm669,"The murder victim isn't the main victim here??

You are undermining the murdered party's situation here simply because they've been murdered, and therefore aren't around to experience the aftermath of things anymore. 

You can't measure murder as simply a life lost, and a person no longer around to experience the realization of that. You have to factor in the magnitude of every experience the person otherwise would've had. You steal all of that from someone when you end their life. You extinguish all the potential they had to live for and you also kill everyone else whom that person might have become. Every past experience that person ever had, any life lessons they learnt, any aspirations they held, all of that invalidated and gone in an instant. There is an intangible but *immense* gravity to that.

It's distasteful to downplay the act of snuffing the life and light out of a human being simply because said person might not be around anymore to *feel* murdered.

We dunno what transpired that day that led to the first man stabbing her and then jumping, but it’s a stretch to say that none of her actions in the lead up to this contributed to the tragedy. She is partly culpable.

The family however, lost the father and the Mum will have to bring up the three kids on her own. The children will forever bear the stigma of their dad murdering his ex-lover before committing suicide.

Culpable? Nothing she did warranted what happened. And saying ""give her the benefit of the doubt"" is redundant when you end up partly blaming her anyway. So she got involved with married men. That somehow means her murder means less? Cheapens the value of her life? As if she's supposed to know that psycho here is gonna snap and kill her and himself?

I have to agree with u/bookworm669 here, she **is** the biggest victim here. The wife and the kids, yeah, they lost a husband/dad/provider. But they get to move on from it. Given time, they'll heal.

I think it all depends on what issues you believe in as well.

If you can’t imagine what pain they’re going through, why on earth are you chiming in on opposing legalisation? “Inspiration” really? Do you think people going through pain care about being an inspiration? Why should anyone have to “fight”? And who gives you the right to tell others what to do?

Aka 'please live your miserable life to its natural end, extend it where possible and suffer for others .. who have the same condition and also aren't supposed to be allowed to decide their own fate'. What's wrong with this person?

"
e47sacu,Mockingbirddd,"Euthanasia is not glorified suicide. It is logical and well-thought through suicide. 

The difference is huge. It is important for society to help people who choose suicide if the cause is emotional and temporary. We can help them back on their feet so they will not choose to kill themselves.

However, in the case of Euthanasia, the cause is both logical and permanent. If there is no way we can stop their suffering, should we not help them if they choose death as the way for them to end their suffering?

So it is ok to made the patient starve to death but it not ok to end his/her life and save him/her from agonizing pain?
It is ok to keep them sedated with morphine till they pass away?

She mentioned ""I cannot imagine the pain that terminally ill people go through, but I believe that if they put up a good fight, they would be an inspiration to others who are battling the same illness to keep fighting."", do she think terminally ill people give a shit about how their threshold of pain will inspire other people? My father had a very high threshold for pain and had never seen him complain over pain ever, but in his last few days ""fighting with lung cancer"" i could see how difficult it was for him.

Yes, her opinion should be automatically invalidated because of her age. I like how some people here think.

[The original ST article on this issue](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/number-of-suicides-among-seniors-hits-record-high) simply pointed out a trend in rising elderly suicides. [The follow up article](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/973kx7/multiple_reasons_behind_elder_suicides/e457xcy/) mentions depression, a lack of social support, physical illness, financial problems, fear of becoming a burden, social disconnection and a lack of knowledge of avenues of help as possible reasons for the trend. Nowhere was euthanasia or terminally ill patients mentioned.

Until [this joker's letter](https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/consider-legalising-euthanasia) appeared. He addresses the original ST article with his example of ""a senior in his 70s or 80s who is poor and has advanced cancer."" This person, should he die, will not be counted as a suicide case because he died to an illness. The example is not relevant to the trend of elderly suicides at all.

Rachel's main point is that euthanasia should not be made available as a solution to the problems mentioned in the original 2 ST articles. The causes behind the rise in elderly suicides must be dealt with instead. The irrelevant side point on terminally ill patients should not be there at all, but she wrote it in because it was mentioned in the previous letter."

Also, the issue of who gets to decide when euthanasia can be administered? 

Do Patients decide? Then how we do ascertain if the patient is in the right state/clarity of mind to make the decision? And what happens in a situation where the fatal dose is administered and the patient has a sudden change of mind? In this situation is the physician culpable for manslaughter? Are legal waivers valid in this situation? Could this be misused?

Do Family members decide, if the patient is incapacitated? How do we ascertain this is not misused, and in the patient’s best interest? What’s the legal angle to this, and do we relook at the AMD?

There's been a case in Belgium whereby the doctor was pretty overzealous with an elderly lady who was depressed (eg SBS Dateline documentary).

Inclusion of waiting periods and two certifying doctors to a council + psychiatrist involvement seems to be the only way to safeguard vulnerable people. People still have the choice but they will need to fulfill criteria to be eligible is the best compromise for less abuse.

e47zwve,xShaD0wMast3rzxs,"In a way, sure. However, I assure you it doesn’t help the people going through said suffering. 

Imagine having terminal stage cancer. The tumour(s) is/are pressing against your bones and nerves and you’re in constant pain. On top of that, chemo has made you bald, and you throw up every hour or so. 

Now that’s just a baseline example. Some of these people would prefer putting their affairs in order and moving on peacefully. Is it cowardice if they decide to end things then extend their suffering further only to still face mortality eventually? Would it help if someone went up to them and said _”why don’t you fight? Don’t you want to be an inspiration?”_ I don’t think these people deserve to feel worse than they already do, by being exposed to the naïveté of a 19 year old undergrad—telling them why they shouldn’t have the right to end their suffering.

Anyway, that’s just for terminal illnesses. My personal view is that everyone should have the freedom to choose to live or die, regardless of illness. We should be the masters of our own lives, not the government. Of course, life should be encouraged where possible, but I disagree with government regulations taking away said freedom."

I am a supporter of legalising euthanasia, but only for the right reasons. What I find unacceptable is the sheer number of people that try to pass off flawed arguments as legitimate ones. The prime example being attempting to discredit her opinion based solely on her age. If 19 is too young, then what about 29, 39, 49, 59 or 69? Where do you draw the line for what is an acceptable age? How did you draw this line?

e48cp2g,PartTimeBomoh,"DNR is NOT euthanasia.

With DNR, you are simply allowed to die by natural means without being given a trial of resuscitation after cardiac arrest. Often times this is offered when it is felt that resuscitation after cardiac arrest would simply prolong suffering without a reasonable expectation of recovering, or result in an unacceptable quality of life thereafter. But to die by DNR, you need to have a disease for which the natural course is death.

That does not happen in euthanasia. You can be a lot less sick, you can be perfectly healthy aside from a sick mind, and still die by euthanasia.

That’s just the difference in standards of how “sick” a person has to be, which is close to a measure of how irreversible a disease process has to be, before one is allowed to die.

Solitude isn't feasible for the average person, a healthy person needs social interactions to stay sane. Just know that you are the most dependable person you have."

For the friends part, it's good to have some cynicism but dont let the cynicism eat you inside out. I have a similar worldview but I try not to let thoughts like this (on top the fear of rejection for being gay) get in the way when building relationships with others. It's a struggle but we all gotta try. Or else we may end up being socially isolated as we age... it's not fun being a lone middle-aged/elderly man with social workers/befrienders your main source of social interaction... "

Did you expect your friends to telepathically sense your sickness and teleport to your doorstep to help you? 

Did no one pay attention to this part? What the fuck is going on in these comments?"
e5f6u23,UnpredictableApple,"Yeah, I realized this growing up. It’s better to know everything and depend on yourself. Always ask for help but at the same time be independent so when there’s nobody there for you, you can stay strong and pick yourself up.

I still believe if you’ve helped someone through a similar tough time, they will return the favour because they understand the situation better. Unless they’re a selfish asshole or having major problems of their own.

Also, it’s not that people don’t care, they just don’t understand how serious the situation is and since it affects you and not them, it’s perceived as “not that bad” on the alert scale.

Hope you hang in there and don’t let the negative moods get to you. Depression strikes unknowingly and can start a vicious cycle. Keep hopes up and you’ll get through it! Jiayou!"
e5f233z,fauxVision,"Yes. Life is depressing in and of itself.  Our existence is forced onto us. We are all forced to exist without our consent. Since suicide is illegal, we just gotta live, and since that’s the only choice, might as well make the best of it for yourself. You gotta create the life that you want. Definitely, you can’t expect circumstance or people to always turn in your favour but you can chart your course to betterment through constant trial and error. For instance now you have this awakening that those friends during good times aren’t true friends and that you cant always take for granted that people you think you can count on will be there for you. Life is about the survival of the fitness. Those who forge the most relationships, step on the most people, and force their way through life most aggressively within legal boundaries get ahead more than those who passively sit and do the minimal. Perhaps by aggressively seeking out more friends and forging more relationships you can eliminate those which do not benefit you and keep those that do. "
e5f4ncs,DuePomegranate,"It doesn't mean that your brother or friends won't help you when you really need it. If you had a cancer diagnosis or something, I hope that you have people who care about you enough to help.

But asking someone to accompany you to the clinic when you have food poisoning... I think people can judge whether you can manage by yourself. What is that person supposed to do, just give you moral support when you are waiting? Help you clean up your vomit?

If it was my own husband who had come down with food poisoning, I would tell him to go by himself (taxi) to the clinic while I stayed home with the kids. I wouldn't ask someone to help me babysit while I go with him to the doctor. Just being practical. "

If she were stuck in jail, she'd call up an old friend from secondary school knowing they have her back. At this point she's practically Singaporean and has an extensive social circle here from work and volunteering. Still, not a single person she'd trust to bail her out of tough situations. 

My hunch is that in SG, people don't tend to make close friends outside of school, so if you've missed that boat it's really hard to find people who'd fight for you outside of family. "

Quit smoking dude man, if you can't do it yourself, go to rehab like my father did. He stopped smoking and is now a better man health-wise. Even if you quit a few days you can already see the positive effects. You should go search up what just stopping a few days does for you. I know you are in a shitty situation but i'm not going to give you cliche advice. Just forgive yourself for every mishap and try again. Back to the topic about reliance on others, don't be heartless either. We are social beings, we will never survive without interacting with people. If you deprive yourself of this, it is equal to mental torture. Pick out the good ones and prioritise them. It goes both ways regarding friends and its a slow build up that will pay off.

I'd always been the fun one in the group and i unknowingly revealed my emotions a little when i was at a gathering and naturally, my friends were thrown off and didn't know how to react.

Buy insurance, diversify your investments, work to be independent of external help. Pick up healthy habits to stay healthy.

At the same time, work towards solving the problem. Practice and put up a friendly face to make acquaintances. Attempt to look for a life partner. And don't forget the only people who will love you unconditionally, your family.

Another practical method is to help others so that people are indebted enough to help you when you need help yourself. Realistic right? But kind helpful people always receive help in turn, and that's an exception to the chinese phrase you mentioned."

e5gqjil,yanqi83,"Hi. Hope you are feeling better now!

It's totally understandable why you are feeling blue now. The money situation, feeling unwell physically, and you are not living with a loved one who can accompany you to the clinic. It's ok to feel this way.

That being said, I believe you'll get out of this state soon enough. Life fluctuates, having a down means you'll get a up too.

If you really yearn for a life where you have several people who really cares for you, you have to be that kind of person who genuinely attracts those type of people. It takes continual effort on your part, it doesn't appear out of the blue.

You need to really put yourself out there and get to know many people, select those you click with, then take time to bond, be there for them (otherwise it won't be fair right?), and continually touch base with them etc. Yes, you will meet many transactional 'friends' or people who don't reciprocate. This is why you need to learn how to be a good judge of character, of others (filter them out!) and also yourself (ensure you are giving joy to others too). It's a two-way street. 

Balance is the key. You can be somewhat independent, yet comfortable enough to ask for help and emotional support when needed.

Hope this gives you some insight. "

Just a little advice for you from my experiences:

Remember that you’re never alone and always look at how you can improve yourself (not gonna ask you to be extra optimistic and all but instead, channel the negative energy to improving yourself and perhaps expanding your social circle) We can’t control others, but we have the power to change ourselves for the better.

In this case your brother could have been super busy and stressed about work/acads and did not fully comprehend the severity of your condition which was why he refused to accompany you, and not because he does not care about you.

we stay together with friends and family because we have a good time with each other and support each other.  the distinction between what we call genuine and transactional may lie in the nature of what we receive - tangible vs intangible. why ""transactional"" sounds sucky may be because in such a relationship, what both wants from each other are purely material things, and all emotions are disregarded. and well, humans crave validation and self-actualization, so it hurts to be reduced to mere objects. when we're dealing with intangible matters, our feelings and sense of self gets validated. that's probably why we don't mind relationships even though we just want the other person to make you happy or just want to make the other person happy to feel good about ourselves.

Maybe the people around you do care, but you just don't know it. You have to make it known to the people who care about you the severity of your situation and that you need their help. Your brother probably felt it wasn't so serious that he should stop whatever he's doing to help you. Perhaps he would've come to help if he thought you couldn't handle it on your own.

e5h6vcy,sguser,"You feel like this because A) you live in Singapore and B) your narrow social circle subscribes to that culture.

In Singapore, a man dying on the street will be ignored or at best, filmed to submit to Stomp. If he's lucky, a foreigner will be on hand to help him. This story has come up again and again locally. Read about a volunteer - yup, it's a foreign citizen. Always.

In *some* other countries, strangers literally give up their lives to help others. You can read about tragedies like school shootings, where teachers and even students, yes CHILDREN, die protecting other students. Such difficult events, thankfully, don't take place often, but they reveal the truth of character. Not everyone's like that. But more widespread offshoots of this same fundamental character shine through in positive circumstances like charity and friendship.

/u/LunarBlessings is correct but his heart is broken. That's exactly what you find all over Singapore. Let's dodge the difficult, meaningful discussions by distracting ourselves with technicalities. We're technically right. We follow the letter of the law, but not the spirit. Let's type mountains of text discussing technical minutiae and not spend a single word addressing the emotional state of /u/fool168. *clap* *clap* *clap* Did you need proof of Singapore's cultural woes? Exhibit A: done, right here.

So what if practically all altruism is transactional at a pedantic level? WHAT DO YOU DO? Do you help those less fortunate than you? Would you take a sick friend to the clinic, even if it's inconvenient? Would you cancel your date with a girl because your brother had a bad fight with your parents and needs a talk?

OP: Genuine friends are rarer than gold and more precious than diamonds. It's a cliche, but true, and applies to finding a girl/boy of your dreams too.

If you want to find them, you have to dig. It's hard work. It will take a long time. You'll get a lot of mud, coal, and shit. But if you find one, even one, it's worth it all.

How to dig? Another true cliche. To make friends, be a friend. Be the person you want others to be.

Here's the tricky part that people don't talk about. You can't change other people. You're searching for those who are likeminded. That means you'll have to cut out people from your life who only want to use you for your wallet, body, or some other triviality. You need to read people, to understand what they are like in truth, not just when they are happy and well-fed emotionally.

Give everyone a chance, maybe two. You will be hurt, but don't let them hurt you more than twice. People who take advantage of you without giving anything in return are not worth your time. Keep them at a distance, and keep searching for true friendship. Keep being a friend to others. It's like finding a girlfriend. If no one around you fits, join new communities. (Warning: do NOT join a cult!) Shake up your social scene. Do you hang out with engineers? Try hanging out with artists. Or vice versa. Try hanging out with older people. Younger people. Participate in making your community better. Volunteer.

OP: You are right. You have only yourself to depend on. Isn't that wonderful? Your current deadbeat ""friends"" - THEY DON'T MATTER. You can go and find real friends, make your life better. It's all on YOU. If you choose, you can have a wonderful life for yourself, surrounded by wonderful people. Have an awesome day.

e5f73g6,thecrustycrap,"I used to feel that way, until i got a taste of reality. When you are living life with a part time job while you see your friends pursuing their degrees, setting up their own businesses, you slowly become an adult when you consider your future, you do the necessary. You hold onto your future, no one else is responsible for your life.

I want to say that I can understand how you feel, i was in normal acad, scored shitty grades and entered an engineering course in NP with really high COP(20+) and scored a shitty GPA. I really hated studying, it took me a lot longer to understand concepts than the rest. I drifted around after ns, that's when it hit me that I cant stay like this forever. I couldn't enter local U, but now im studying private and doing my best, even though i really suck at it.

I only have a few close friends so I prioritise them, always ask about their lives and when they're feeling down, allocated a part of my budget each year for their birthdays and helped them with assignments and stuff. Ultimately they didn't treat me the same way I treated them and I realised there's no point making someone your number one when you're not even in their top 10. And this wasn't malicious on their part, they just had large social circles and friends that they liked more than me. And if you keep doing unreciprocated favours for your friends they may even come to resent you because they feel bad about the increasingly lopsided relationship that yoy initiated but they didn't ask for. "
e5f23jh,NecroHexr,"This is pretty silly advice from personal experience. For about a period of 6 months, I had a pair of friends I would care for. Answered their homework questions, messaged them to ask about their wellbeing, and on their birthday, planned something nice for them.

Well, they took everything for granted and snubbed me. Not the first time someone has done so and won't be the last.

e5h8r5s,LunarBlessings,"I do not understand your points fully. I will just try my best to address what i think i know. 

Singaporeans certainly do not ignore a dying man on the road. 1 or 2 cases that goes on television or stomp does not count and neither do they negate the other cases of people helping each other that dont get on stomp.

Strangers risking their lives to help one another. The points i have made so far addresses this. It definitely does not water down their heroic actions. 

You give me the impression that you think i am attacking them. I am certainly not targeting people who help others.

Discussing the minor details was never meant as a distraction. I do not understand why when you were pretty straightforward in your points so far, suddenly decide to swerve into sarcasm territory. My point has always been “If you want to receive help and EXPECT to receive said help, make sure you have helped others. Else you absolutely do not deserve to get pissed or upset when you don’t receive help. In the event if you do receive help from a stranger, give them a thanks or whatever so they can feel good about it and everyone wins. The cycle continues.”. My target audience was never to people who have figured it out but to people who are absolutely trash and cant seem to understand why they have no friends.

Whether OP has done so or not i do not know and have stated so. My original comment was to u/sageadam. It was never meant for OP but if he finds something in my words then good for him. If he got fucked multiple times by friends who sucks, im not the comforting kind. On the other hand, I’ve seen friends who were in OP situations and usually they are shit friends you don’t want to be with. Again, not attacking OP.

Have i helped my friends even in times on inconvenience? Yes.
Did they help me when i asked for it? Yes. Of course there are those that dont but those are people you cut off or reduce resources to.

I agree with your other points to OP. If you want friends, you have to put in effort :)"
e5had28,Kwaychup,"I actually know many Singaporeans who rush to help strangers. Sometimes I do so myself (although I frequently succumb to Bystander Effect). Maybe I'm rare case but I actually have this kind of positive social circle. 

It feels really good to help others. I feel useful, accomplished, like an agent of goodness. I feel like I have lived up to humanity's ideal of being a good neighbour. Thats the emotional value of helping. 

This kind of value can be subtle, and not something you consciously calculate before helping. 

Again I stress that theres nothing wrong with all of this. We should help as much as we can, and savour the good feeling. 

Also, maybe, i'm just talking a load of crap. Hahaha. Please feel free to disagree with my opinions. "
e5f42yn,LunarBlessings,"People love to believe theres true altruism. But of course it doesn’t exist. People help others always to expect some sort of return. If there’s no return, they get upset. No “thank you” or any sort of response of gratitude? Then i don’t feel so good helping you. I might help you again but the chances are even lower.

But not everyone can accept this truth and hence will lie to themselves to convince themselves that they are “selfless”

Help goes both ways. You want to get help you must be willing to help others and invest equal time. Else end up like OP where I’m assuming he helped some friends and now they neglect him. Of course there are many other reasons but this is the most common one I’ve seen and heard. 

Happens all the time. Have you helped said friend enough for you to be pissed about said friend not helping you when you are in need? "

e5hfnu9,Shinryu_,"Marriage can be for so many different reasons damn. It could be that the guy not wanting the girl to leave by effectively ""locking"" her or vice versa. 

It could be satisfying their or own family or to further their own agenda for example, this person is the daughter's CEO of a big company and marrying her can effectively raise the guy's status, political power and influence in the company and it will be better if the current CEO died and he takes over his big business or maybe even remain in a high position as the family would look bad if the husband is working in a low level position job. 

If I'm going by if it's transactional if they just married, yes. When you are married, you are effectively telling everyone that your spouse is yours and no one is allowed to do anything to her except yourself.

Those are just some scenario but ultimately, anyone who looks for a partner ALWAYS lists down a certain set of qualities they like such as being pretty, handsome, kind, nice ass or tits etc. "

e5h15iq,AyuTrex,"Finally, I've found a person who agrees and thinks the same way I do. 
I too firmly believe there isn't such a thing called true altruism, and my rationale behind that is exactly the same as yours which is that as long as people are expecting a response or feel better(even a little bit) after the act, that is a gain and thus not selflessness.
Hell, even the phrase of ""putting yourself in other people's shoes"" which is intended to educate people being more considerate, is also asking that said person to think what would happen to him/her if they were caught up in a bad situation.(thus thinking about themselves and not others)
I've pointed out this to many people when we talked about this topic and in return they've always asked me the same question. Then what would be an example of true altruism to you then?

I've thought about it and since feelings/emotions are the main mechanism as to why true altruism does not exist, only then a non-sentient being(devoid of feelings/emotions) can be one. A being who does not feel/gain anything from performing an act of good will, that being will be selfless because it has no consciousnesses/feelings to feel good about itself after a ""Thank you"" or how people will see it in a positive light, or a mental pat on the back. "

It doesn't make sense that they unconditionally love you but you don't to them.

But really, there's also a point when the other party isn't invested in an ""acquaintence"" relationship either, so the key point is to recognise that point and know when you're not welcome, and take your exit.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, maybe I haven't met the right people. Maybe, almost for sure, I'm just terrible to be with and nobody has anything to gain from being my friend.

I do know I am full of problems but isn't that what friendship is for? I don't care about your issues and you don't care about mine, we are friends and we take care of each other no matter what kind of stupid shit someone pulls."

For people who are born into dysfunctional/broken families, they naturally wouldn’t have many people to rely on. That’s just one of many examples I can give.

If its a 1 or 2 time thing it is extremely easy to shrug it off and continue your day feeling good about yourself even just a little. Try it 50 times or 100 times with the other person not responding. No gesture to show thanks, nothing at all. See if you will still feel the same. 

You do not give a friend a birthday present without looking for their response. No one puts a birthday gift at their friend’s doorsteps and no expect any form of response. 

Relationships/friendships are always transactional. It is not WRONG. It is the perfect way for both parties to be happy. You help me i help you has always worked. Those that commit less than the other will be the ones unhappy. 

Helping that stranger once or twice is nothing worth noting about if you are not in a hurry. Try helping someone when you are in a hurry only to see them ignore you afterwards. Do this 50 times and you will realize that you always want something in return. 

Edit: In response to your point on“.. being taken advantage by others ...”. That is a matter of your own character and whether you can detect if someone is a shit hole. Not everyone is a shit hole. People who are shit tend to display obvious characteristics. If it comes from a friend who you trust a lot then you will have to prepare to not be stepped on next time. People who are stepped on are usually extremely agreeable and do not enforce their own opinions. Even after they know they are taken advantaged of, they will still continue to help once or a few times more. That itself is a core problem that they have to fix on their own. No one can teach you how to say “No”. Its a self-realization. "
e5h2ul9,LunarBlessings,"Yes i do agree that a being who does not gain anything would be considered as selfless. But thats impossible for me to empathize with. 

Discussing these with friends usually lead to these conclusions - Silence as their image of themselves shatter from realization or they get really defensive and the discussion boils down to convincing them transactional is not wrong. Or that they simply just refuse to listen and the discussion ends. 

People love to believe transactional is wrong. It becomes something ingrained in them via the media they consume or schools or some mentor they had. 

The most laughable statement being “I like to help people and expect nothing in return :)”. Yea right buddy!"

e5fjlqc,AwkwardSheep,"> I don’t get why people keep making excuses for OP’s brother’s bad behaviour

What are you on about? In what way is it 'bad behaviour'? Do you know what his brother was doing at the time?

What if OP's brother was at a big job interview? Taking a test? Helping a friend with something important? What if the brother's had to leave work a few times to help OP with their various problems, and was being pressured by his boss not to leave again? Surely food poisoning isn't so severe that you would suggest OP's brother should've dropped everything and rush home?

Besides, OP in no way indicated that his/her brother was standoffish, nor that he had been a bad person in the past. Just that he simply couldn't come home this time because he was busy with something.

Sounds like you got caught up in OP's sob story and had a lapse in empathy yourself.

"
e5fd1bl,pussyfista,"And why do you think he has these issues?

The root of OP’s problem is him not being well off enough financially and as a result he doesn’t have any friends to depend on especially when he’s sick. He’s also a smoker, which contributes to his deteriorating health.

So quitting smoking not only improve his health and financial situation, it could also indirectly help improve his friendship with others.

It not impossible for you to just be that suey to always meet terrible people okay. Or due to circumstances of so use to letting people walk all over you that you keep falling back into familiar patterns.

e5f62v1,sageadam,"If expecting a simple appreciation such as verbal thank you counts as expecting something in return, I agree with you then. 

But there are examples where people take care of their disabled child, spouse, friend and even strangers on voluntary basis who do not have the mental capacity to be appreciative or capability to give anything in return. I think the fact that most people expect something in return for their help, even simple gestures, makes those care givers even more admirable. "

e5ftgeg,927normie,"You're right in saying that there's nothing wrong with transactional relationships. In Psychology, social relationships under the Social Exchange Theory can be classified into either transactional and communal. Transactional relationships form the bulk of our relationships, whether it be with friends, colleagues, acquaintances etc, meaning that the basis of a relationship is dependent on what each party has to offer for each other. On the other hand, communal relationships are more unconditional, in which case you do something without expecting anything in return, because your relationship is already of a certain level. Usually this is the case with family, and sometimes close friends / partners who transition from transactional relationships to communal ones."
e5gkbd6,eggsandkayatoast,"I see, you've been through a bad episode of bad poisoning, so that's why you're taking it quite personally... I think you've misunderstood me lol. I don't disagree that we should help someone in need if we can (esp family), but I have an issue with your reasoning that if we can't help at that instant, we're selfish people who deserve bad karma (sometimes it's true, but as others have mentioned, there could be other reasons. The brother could be selfish for all we know, but others are simply providing another perspective). Also it seems like the concept of severity (ie. cancer vs vomitting) still jumped over your head. Wishing (bad) karma onto others isn't exactly magnimous on your part either, but if that boosts your sense of self-righteousness, then whatever 🤷"

Given a situation where friends enter into a communal relationship and Friend A helps to comfort Friend B to relieve some emotional stress. Some people will say Friend A did it without expecting anything in return, in which case that'll be Friend B comforting Friend A back. Friend A is still doing it because of social obligation/responsibility to his friend B, because Friend A knows that since they are friends for so long, he/she has to comfort Friend B. That obligation/responsibility is the same as what a person would do for his/her family, so that he/she won't feel bad by being seen in a bad light if he/she chooses to neglect their family(This can be applied to the friend example as well). This is my view on it and I like to hear yours."
e5ffetj,CaseyMcKinky,"If taking a factor out of the equation results in ""solving"" a problem, I don't think it is an overstatement to call it a root cause.

e5f2w14,aborted_foetus,Absolutely agree!
e5f9s9x,aborted_foetus,Why? All I am saying is that the existence of vows does not in itself guarantee action 
e5jq9ri,927normie,"Haha I'd like to think that you don't really 'enter into a communal relationship' (except in the case of family) because it's a natural progression of friendship. Not all relationships will reach this stage and no one starts off being unconditional in their relationships. 

With transactional relationships, you'd be more concerned with keeping track of how much you've given and received in a relationship because you wouldn't want a situation where you're giving more than you're receiving back or vice versa.

With communal relationships, you're purely concerned with the welfare of the other party without thinking about any benefits that an action brings you (even if it may benefit you). In a way, because communal relationships evolve from transactional ones, only transactional relationships that are deemed equitable by two parties would then progress into a communal one (both parties satisfied with how much they've given and received from the other). Although there's still giving and receiving in the communal relationship, you're not as concerned with keeping track of it. 

In your example, I don't think in a communal relationship, you'd worry about the fact that you'd be seen in a bad light if you didn't comfort your friend/family but rather you'd be concerned with the actual well-being of the person and wanting them to feel better. 

Idk if I may have missed the point you're making, feel free to critique."
e5ffvkh,xiangusk,You need to postpone any plans to propose in the next ten years. 
e5pacvn,AyuTrex,"Thank you for the additional clarification. It is very interesting to see the use of technical terms to properly classify how a relationship can progress into another status depending on equity of both parties. And I definitely do agree that for family, it's special in a sense that it's straight into a communal relationship.

With regards the example I gave, let's assume that it has nothing to do with being seen in a bad spotlight, more towards something like feeling good about himself/herself after comforting their friend. I personally feel that as long as we have feelings, there will always be a tiny part of us that feels good after doing something good, be it for a stranger or a close friend or even a family member. People generally deny that mental pat on the back by saying they do it for others' interest, but I disagree with that because if I were to put them in a situation where they did not help, they would probably feel like shit. And for a negative feeling scenario to exist, the other probability can only be a positive one, not indifference(in which case is needed for true altruism to exist, selflessness without any gains even emotionally)."
clxe7ci,DingyWarehouse,"Your main concern should be with the recovery of your wrist and not whether your BMT will be extended. IRL no one gives a damn whether you completed your bmt or vocational training.  I'm not being rude, I'm simply telling you the truth. You do NOT owe your health to anyone.

Remember - should you be spat out with a permanent injury at the end of 2 years - no one will shed a tear for you."

During this FFI, the MO will decide through your current health if you're eligible for BMT. What you do to maintain poor health is none of my business. But its through this FFI that is most crucial if you have any intentions to ""skip"" BMT forever. "

Cause your arm is fucked up. You should just rest it out man. At least your treatment is paid for and you are receiving a small amount of $. (Plus if you slipped on the floor in BMT, don't know if that counts as a service injury. If it is MAKE SURE THEY GET THE INJURY REPORT FILED!

Don't injure yourself permanently for something that is going to last only 2 years. 

> and I can't get out of home

IIRC you can leave 3 times a day while on MC for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But don't take me as a primary source. 

Sometimes, life just sucks. But remember, this too shall pass. Although there is nothing I can do, I urge you to just hang in there. 2 years is 2 years, nothing will ever extend it without you wanting it to. (except DB)"
clxghxo,coffeebroth,"so you OOC-ed from pec C9? wow. that's a story right there.

yea, it sucks that you might have to recourse, but normally if you are lucky, the unit will not send you out until later in your army life.

clxdul4,rainbowyuc,"This might be small consolation, but look at it this way. So you may have to extend your BMT, but your total NS time isn't extended and in the end, NS is just a small phase of life that you really want to get over with (unless you actually want to sign on). Think of it as a 3 week holiday from NS, most of us would've killed to have this break when we were doing NS."
clxf3sv,dekid_,"Short answer: it depends 

Here comes  the long one (thats what he said):

Anyway, depending on your  company; tons  of shit may or may not happeb.

Firstly, if they OOC you. YES YOU  MUST  RE DO BMT.

Secondly, if they do NOT OOC you. NO YOU DO NOT NEED TO RE DO BMT. 

(Pes c BMT is STILL considered BMT coz you still will fire rifle, go field camp, throw grenade)

However should  you up pes, your unit is the one that  decides whether or not to send you for BMT AGAIN just for the sake of leadership course (SIT test) and what not. 

A simpler way to look at it is.

Never clear bmt = recruit

To add on, you should understand the commander's point of view. There is absolutely no way they will let you skip your MC just to go back for training. They are liable for you, if you have any further injury, it reflects badly on them and the SAF organization. "
cly9u7b,calyce2,"Hi I was a PES C recruit too, now currently serving the rest of my service.

It doesn't help at all with the military regimentation and strict discipline, as well as NSFs being the punching bag for everything under the sun, even for mistakes that are no part of their own. NSFs have little power and always have to abide by orders from the higher ups.

The army and national service isn't made for everyone and not everyone can be bound by strict military regimentation and environment. Not everyone can thrive in a military environment and there is little wonder why so many people try to keng down-pes, feign mental illnesses and other psychiatric conditions and even try to get exempted from the army.

Many people have stated that in times of crisis, they would leave Singapore instead of defending it. So why force everyone to go through harsh training that disrupts their education/work life? Others wrote that people get punished because a single person does something wrong in their squadron. NS may break people beyond repair.

Essentially, depression and mental health issues are poorly-understood, especially considering the impact they have on our lives. So people who have problems don't know how to sound out, or feel that it is unsafe or unwise to do so. (And having depression makes it even harder to speak out anyway, due to its very nature.) A major disruption to a daily routine, such as joining national service (or getting a new job, or moving to a new country, or whatever) is often enough to bring everything out of balance. If the sufferer feels alone and isolated enough that they don't feel they can talk about their problems with anyone else, then suicide might seem like the path of least resistance.

So there is ""something wrong"" in that clearly this is a situation that should not have come to be, but making it right requires huge and sweeping systemic changes both from the top down and from the bottom up."

He says that nsf are easier to talk to as compared to the other regulars. and since he was an outcast, the other regulars sort of spread stuff about him so even the nsf doesn’t talk to him much. I thought only girls do this kind of things. Im just saying, even if he commits suicide, they will be guilty and sad for awhile but I think they will return to their behaviour not long after.

So the balance between stopping the suicides and risking doing something half-cocked that might make things even worse is something that has to be decided, and certainly by smarter people than I am, because I have no idea where that balance is either.

National Service is one of several major disruptions that could cause mental health issues to rise, and not the only one.

If any minister's sons were to have commited suicide during National Service, the parents would surely and clearly not let the matter off with just an investigation. Neither would SAF be allowed to just answer to the parents with a simple investigation. Namely they have to answer to the press on regulations, guidelines, mental wellbeing etc. 

If a nobody commited suicide during ns in camp, it will just be written off as an investigation which was probably lead by maybe mental health, relationship problems, money problems etc. But if an affluent person's son commited suicide during ns in camp, the parents would want to know what caused it; superiors, peers, workload, environment etc. The press would also try to pry all sorts of info they can. Then SAF would also be pressured to provide a proper recap and followup of what led to the suicide of said minister's son.

Also, if you have authority, power and connections in the public sector in Singapore as a minister; you won't try to use that to pressure the organization on what caused your precious young son to commit suicide?
Those parents who have already lost their young sons, though didn't have that authority, power nor connection, have already shown us that even they willingly went beyond whatever their means to fight for the justice their sons deserved; much less a minister parent?"

You know, the standard small-penis shit that sgts like to shout at recruits. The ah beng got pissed off and shouted ""Eh I trying to listen right, you want me to learn or you want to tekan?"" And this guy's voice was a bit shrill, but VERY loud, much louder than the sgt yelling at him so everyone there could hear him and even the sgt instructing us paused for a second.

e6ybsg4,ivatyw,"This is like the 377a controversy. Jeez. I have no comments on that, however this mental health issue hits close to home so ...

As some here have already pointed out, the right law to help with suicide is under Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. (Or any other mental issues for that matter, if you are facing any please know that you’re not alone in it, we can face them together.)

A law where “actual prosecutions are rare” just means that that law is redundant; we can live without it. The Penal Code is solely meant for punishment. Check the dictionary. Penal means “relating to, used for, or prescribing the punishment of offenders under the legal system”. Like many, I fail to see how this underscores any meaning to aid, rehabilitate or encourage sufferers. As for maintaining a moral ecology, having sufferers try to make their suicides more successful... wow we are going to have truly a more innovating environment. I will not argue whether criminalising suicide is right or wrong, but this law is senseless, out of touch, and definitely in the wrong chapters of the law book.

Personally, I would not even give a second thought about some obsolete law if I felt truly hopeless. What will some string of words do to me when I am already considering the thought of ending my own life? It certainly would not stop me. All I have to do is make sure I succeed. In that moment before death, all I can think about would be that there was no other way. Trapped. Helpless. That I could not live with myself anymore. Everyone around me would be better off without me... There would be no space left in my mind to think about the repercussions, such as how my family would be suffering if I did end my life. There would be even lesser space for me to think about some stupid law. 

The presence of this law will not prevent sufferers  from actively seeking out death.

After all, no one can prosecute a corpse. "
e6y5pq2,prime5119,"Idk what to go with this. On the right side it is useful in prevention because it make you think twice of the consequences of self harming seriously.

People who have *just* been arrested (like what he said, if they’re treating it as straightforward criminal nuisance vs. attempted suicide) and require/request for immediate medical treatment post-arrest can - and are - warded in hospital, handcuffed to the bed and under police supervision. I’ve seen a few of these cases, and I’m sure any ER nurse would be able to tell some stories as well.

e6yt262,phoenixparksg,"Thanks, this is good where they expand the Mental Health Act to address this. It means that there is state intervention is now being addressed for attempted suicide cases. "
e6yfmzo,samglit,"The way our laws are setup, we can't give a mandatory treatment order to someone who hasn't committed an offence - that seems right, e.g. if you're an insane, uncontrollable masturbater, but quietly so, in your own home, and no threat to others, the state shouldn't be busting down your door to send you for mandatory sex addict treatment.  


I have mixed feelings about the 1 year imprisonment threat, since the mandatory treatment order is usually couched in a way that says - complete your treatment or go to jail. This is more cost effective and less intrusive than forcing the patient to stay full time at a psychiatric hospital.  However, not sure how well this is perceived by someone who's already suicidal.  Not talking about it would seem better than publicizing it constantly?"
e6yddjf,Reddit-Loves-Me,Maybe they were afraid she would attempt again? 
e6y6hia,phoenixparksg,"Having a breakdowns in public is not an attempted suicide case. If she had a mental breakdown, she will be referred for treatment. Handcuffed to dialysis machine??? Handcuffs like firearms are drawn from armoury by duty personnel on shifts. They have to be returned like the firearms as they are controlled items and cannot be given away as they will be prosecuted. 

No police officer or Police Force is going to allow a police Office to stand by the dialysis machine while the handcuff is supposedly used for this. 

Criminals or suspects that need dialysis are sent to Changi Prison Hospital. No need for handcuffs as it within prison and there are restraints for difficult people.

We don’t have to go all out to take them to a doctor, hang out everyday etc, just a text from time to time to let them know they are not alone is good too. "

Also doesn't help that mentally ill people are encouraged to be upfront and honest about their condition, yet society disregard them at the same time. Claiming that they are just weak individuals that needs to get more sunlight and exercise. Or just get a job as if employees are all willing to open arms and accept a mentally ill individual. It's a tough spot and unfortunately there is no way to educate the public who thinks they are too smart and better than everyone else cause they were born into a good family.

The idea that everyone would need to have “sympathy”  and conform to your standards of victimhood is utterly stupid, all you build and get are a bunch of delicate snowflakes. Show me evidence that she was coerced into sexual intercourse and raped, and ill agree with you and suggest that the alleged perpetrator should get castrated and thrown in jail to rot for rape. Other than that, do not come up with all these statements full of feelings and emotions, such discourse of microaggression only leads to victimhood.

e75bjxo,ahmad_firdauz,"Anecdote from personal experience and from conversations with foreign friends in HR departments: when there are allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct, HR will almost always side with the female worker. Even if allegations are unsubstantiated, guy in question will often get blacklisted. In fact, it is not uncommon for the guy to be laid off, especially in smaller companies. Why? because scandals are expensive and outweigh whatever profits retaining the male worker can bring. Some companies like [NBC have gone to the extent of making it mandatory for workers to report any inappropriate relationships or risk getting fired for 'covering it up'](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/26/nbc-issues-hugging-guidelines-staff-wake-matt-lauer-sexual-assault/)

Sexual abuse and coercion can and does happen. When it happens and it can be proven, we name and shame the perpetrators. If it cannot be proven and/or it is shown to be an overreaction on the part of the victim, we name and shame anyway.

Similarly, when *some* workers abuse their sexuality to get ahead professionally, that is slut-like behaviour that deserves to be shamed."

e75bgqj,caritas6,"Guess I'll try.

First of all, none of us know the details of the matter, so all our comments are *entirely* speculation. Given this, would it not be more charitable to withhold judgment. There are so many comments assuming she was ready to cheat on her boyfriend and sleep her way up the corporate ladder and is only sorry she got caught.

It is not difficult to imagine an uneven power dynamic where a junior staff person could be coerced into a relationship. And it is also not difficult to imagine a young staff being uncertain if HR would take her side or her superiors.

Further, even with the worst possible motivations, do people really think death is an appropriate punishment for cheating and that she's entirely undeserving of sympathy. There are people more or less celebrating an attempted suicide who need to take a good long look in the mirror.

We all desire forgiveness for our own mistakes, why are we so keen to be vile to others. If that was us, or our sister, or our close friend, how would we hope others would react?

This is also cyclical. Anytime a suicide happens there’s gonna be a huge torrent of mental health awareness only to die down and the cycle repeats again. Mental health is a complicated subject, and could use all the nuance that is needed to understand this issue fully. It isn’t a sexy topic either, and it’s gonna fade into the background easily, so people ought to continue the conversation even when there’s no important incident happening.

e3ap56c,XanPercyCheck,">i find it interesting that in a topic about the problem of elderly suicide

It is natural for people to die at that age. The failing organs, close to 100% chance of cancer, severe depression, and other standard symptoms of ageing are just old people's bodies trying to tell them ""I'm supposed to be in the ground right now, the hell are you doing?"""

e39w62a,FourteenOhFive,"Frankly though: as far as I know, the human body isn't genetically ""designed"" to live ~~forever~~ so I agree with you on legalising active euthanasia.

But your point on:

> ...They tend to feel like they can't contribute... 

I believe is the main issue. I think the feeling of becoming a noncontributing member of a group/community/society is bound to hit hard on any oneself's psychological well-being, regardless of age.

Especially so in a high paced society like Singapore. Where we are in an environment of rushrushrush-workworkwork/studystudystudy from since the moment we are born.

Once we hit the age of retirement(the *real* type of retirement, where you don't work anymore.) that's when the depression shit ***really*** hits the fan."

e3a1ljo,_regan_,the last sentence is really well said. only limitation i can think of where euthanasia should be allowed in sg would be for terminally ill patients who are suffering in pain with no possibility of recovery.
e39wjtk,,"No problems with your arguments. Think you have made some solid points. The tough part is how we can keep our senior citizens engaged and to allow them opportunities to still contribute positively. I don't think Singapore is doing enough in this regard. 

However, I gotta say that I am still not yet decided on how I feel about the legalisation of euthanasia for the non-terminally ill people. There are valid arguments on both sides and it is something that I am still trying to fully comprehend. Sure, euthanasia for terminally ill, but for perfectly healthy individuals, I find it difficult to accept. 

At risk of moving too far away from the thread, may I also interest you in this documentary which I have watched recently? It highlights the moral dilemma associated with euthanasia. Heartbreaking. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCRpuTRA7-g"

Oh that's true. In the perspective of ""progress for our nation"" in Singapore, we need all the help we can get, with healthy, able-bodied citizens of Singapore.

Difficult to imagine how the development of Singapore may turn out, if euthanasia becomes more readily accessible - even for healthy individuals. Anyway, thanks for that documentary!

e457xcy,Jammy_buttons,"Twice in his life, Mr Ho, 70, has thought about ending it all.

Once, years ago, the former businessman wanted to throw himself from the top of a hotel because of financial and domestic woes.

He changed his mind when it occurred to him that the 10-storey hotel might not be high enough to ensure his suicide attempt was successful.

In 2014, he went to the top of a 22-storey HDB block. This time, however, his attempt was thwarted by his inability to climb over the railing. He also realised he did not want to bring shame to his family.

Mr Ho, who did not want to give his full name, said he considered suicide because his problems seemed endless and life held nothing to look forward to. ""I thought death would be the solution,"" he said.

Unlike Mr Ho, other seniors who are gripped by the same sense of hopelessness do succeed in taking their own lives.

The number of people aged 60 and older who committed suicide peaked at 129 last year, the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991, the Samaritans of Singapore said last month.

In the past decade, the lowest number was in 2008, when 92 seniors took their lives, and the highest prior to last year was 123 seniors in 2016.

However, given the rise in the number of seniors in Singapore due to an ageing population, the suicide rate among those aged 60 and older has, in fact, decreased over the years, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.

It is understood that the Samaritans suicide figures cover Singaporeans, permanent residents as well as foreigners.

The suicide rate among Singapore residents - Singaporeans and PRs - over the age of 60 has generally been falling over the decade, MOH figures show.

In 2007, it stood at 22.4 for every 100,000 residents aged 60 and above, and the rate was 16.4 last year, with slight fluctuations in between.

Compared with other developed societies in the region, Singapore's elder suicide rate last year was slightly lower.

In Japan, the suicide rate of seniors aged 60 to 69 was 18.8 per 100,000 people last year. In Hong Kong, the suicide rate for people over 65 stood at 24.2 per 100,000 people in 2016.

Still, elderly people remain the group most vulnerable to suicide in Singapore. This ties in with the global trend of elder suicide rates being generally the highest in populations.

Samaritans figures show that those aged 60 and above accounted for more than one-third of deaths by suicide last year.

National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said a key difference between elderly and young people is their different stages of life, and the amount of help or resources they feel they have.

""While a large proportion of young people are likely to have access to the financial and social support of family, in particular their parents, and see themselves at a stage of life where they believe they have some control over how their future will turn out, the same cannot be said of the elderly,"" said Professor Tan.

Experts say the reasons for suicide among the silver-haired are multi-factorial and complex: mental illness such as depression, a lack of social support, physical illness, financial problems, fear of becoming a burden, social disconnection and a lack of knowledge of avenues of help.

Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation, said the elderly are unable to cope with major life changes.

""When the elderly feel overwhelmed by changes and losses, fear nothing will get better and find it meaningless or useless to carry on struggling, that's when thoughts of suicide may arise,"" she said.

For Mr Ho, death seemed alluring when all the central pillars of his life collapsed. His family business went into bankruptcy and he had multiple chronic diseases. His home life, with a wife who was herself burnt out, and an intellectually challenged son, was not happy.

In the meantime, Mr Ho's friends got older and died. Lonely and depressed, he would check himself into hospital, saying he was suicidal.

The turning point came when his frequent hospital admissions and comments on suicide caught the attention of hospital staff, who referred him to the Institute of Mental Health and Tsao Foundation for psychiatric help and counselling.

He was also offered day-care services and sent to live in a nursing home near his house where his family members visit often.

Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health charity Silver Ribbon, said training in basic mental health knowledge is crucial for professionals in the health and social service sectors so that they can recognise the warning signs.

Counsellors say it would also be helpful to address the barriers that prevent the elderly from talking about suicide or from seeking help.

One major barrier could be the law itself. Under Section 309 of the Penal Code, an individual who attempts suicide can be jailed for up to a year and fined.

Though it is rare for a person to be charged with attempted suicide, advocacy groups such as the Association of Women for Action and Research have called for the repeal of suicide laws, saying they deter treatment, not attempts.

A committee, co-chaired by Second Minister for Law Indranee Rajah and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin, which has been tasked with reviewing the criminalisation of attempted suicide, among other things, aims to complete its work this year.

Mr Kelvin Lee, manager at Touch Caregivers Support, said that in addition to formal care services, more accessible modes of help in the community should be mobilised.

Two years ago, Touch piloted a Community Enablement Project in Ang Mo Kio to draw seniors out of their homes through activities so they can engage and watch out for one another.

Residents who once struggled with depression are now reaching out and befriending elderly neighbours.

Another barrier may be the lack of awareness that there are drug and non-drug options that old people can turn to for help.

Professor Kua Ee Heok, senior consultant psychiatrist in the National University Health System who is known for his research on suicide, said it is often linked to depression and therefore long-term prevention of depression is key.

Said Prof Kua: ""Studies have shown that non-drug approaches like using music, art, gardening and mindfulness can help reduce depressive symptoms, and we should encourage such lifestyles."""

The only scenario i can think of where euthanasia is viable is if you have a debilitating illness which leads to completely losing your cognitive function. Such things can be planned beforehand. Otherwise, the elderly deserve a second chance! Especially in their golden years. Gardening, walking in the park, talking to other elderly, are also ways to enjoy life.

looks like a consistent band of both absolute numbers and per capital with a slight upward trend since '97 with a drop in 2017 being an outlier. elderly numbers both in absolute and relative percentage of total suicides is absolutely rising year after year from the last high of 2012 where an exceptional number of 467 suicides were recorded with highs across every age group.

e460g40,MeleeTheMalay,"It doesn't have to be an either-or situation. I think we should have both subsidised counselling/mental healthcare and the option for euthanasia after. All life is precious but free will and protecting the elders' dignity shouldn't be sidelined either. 

Physical suffering aside, I'd say sometimes elders with poor financial circumstances (be it themselves or their children) slowly lose their will to live because they can't afford the increasing amounts of healthcare  required as they age. Just thinking out loud here but I wonder if making healthcare on serious illnesses more affordable may indirectly alleviate suicidal tendencies by relieving their fear of burdening their loved ones financially. "
e465got,Bearswithjetpacks,"How about the elderly that can't do any of the things you've mentioned, and yet have full cognitive function? They don't even have to be the elderly.

My dad was 59 when he passed away from lung cancer that became metastatic and affected multiple body systems. He could barely stand and had to be helped by my mom to use the toilet. At some point, he fell because my mom couldn't support his weight and broke a couple of bones. A couple of weeks before he died, he was struggling to breathe, and couldn't eat because swallowing was torturous for him. Through his entire ordeal, he was fully lucid, able to communicate his thoughts to the people around, each word excruciatingly pain for him to utter. Yet we were told we could only administer so much morphine to ease his pain, lest his respiratory function deteriorate.

I hope that's enough to convince you that there's at least one other reason why euthanasia is something worth considering, if not mandatory in determining if we are ethically ready to deal with the future of this country.

Edit: I'd like to add that I fully agree with making access to psychiatric treatment and medication easier, and bolstering education on mental health in tandem for people of all ages, and especially so for the young. The stigma of being diagnosed with mental illness in singapore is still disturbingly real. I wouldn't put it past many students, middle-aged people and even the informed young adult to taunt someone suffering from depression, schizophrenia, social anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder as ""xiao"" or ""gila"" - and that's an extremely disheartening thought, that while the western world seems to be embracing this concept of mental health, we're still rooted in archaic perspectives and stereotypes. We're going to see (if we haven't already been caught with our pants down) the number of youths/adolescent attempting self-harm and suicide shoot up dangerously in the near future, and this will happen because we as laypeople chose not to acknowledge the signs even when the rest of the world has begin to combat the impending epidemic."

Some aren't even aware that these avenues exist, because their quality of living has always been stagnated at whatever point they're currently at, and they simply resign themselves to that fate. All one has to do to see this for themselves is to seek out one of the many 1-room rental flats scattered around the many estates and open their eyes and ears.

I've seen grandparents pass. It was fucking horrible. Mind going, rolling around in bed, no teeth, unable to fend for themselves or even think clearly or leave their bed without multiple nurse's aid, mistaking family members for other people long gone, muscles shrunken with disuse, diapers on, mindlessly struggling, breath rattling, fighting.

On the flipside: I do understand that it probably shouldn't be a drive-though service. ""One injection to go"", because someone's feeling bad for a day or two might be a huge waste.

Yes, everyone should be allowed to decide when to end one's life, but you probably shouldn't decide this on a whim. Switzerland's procedures, requiring sessions with a doctor first, seem right to me. Kinda similar to an abortion: It's for you (as a girl) to decide if you want to have a kid, but a lot of local laws require you to go through some (neutral! If the process tries to sway you that's BS) consultation process first.

These are the main arguments against Euthanasia. Otherwise, conventional and medical opinions tend to lean towards having no qualms about an individual choosing to end his/her life in dignity so long as it is an consensus reached among trained medical staff. 


Personally, I don't think this is something to be dictated by law. The decision should lie solely with the individual, or in the case that he/she is unable to provide consent, their next of kin **or** primary caretaker. "
dxzti9k,Operadrama,"Ex vet staff.  I have seen pets making great recovery after a serious illness or infection and being sent back home with the family, but at the same time I’ve seen a fair share of  animals that didn’t make it through the ordeal. There are owners who refused to put down their pets despite the grim prognosis from the vets. Cases like very old cats with chronic kidney infection for years, and their time has come but owners chose not to PTS because it was cruel and they feel that they or the vets are not the one to decide whether the animal should be free from suffering and would rather leave things to heaven’s hand. When you have a clear look at the situation, realizing that the animals are no longer able to eat, unable to control their pee and poo , drooling excessively on their deathbed, not responding to any medication and any calling or simulation from the owners anymore, you’ll be glad that euthanasia option is available. It was painful for me to watch patients living in pain and grasping for their last breath while some owners I met were in complete denial that their pets are in immerse pain, wishing they just need another few days of rest to get back on their feet. 

I would leave the judgment to the qualified vets who knows better at reading symptoms, making a well assessed prognosis and determining if further treatment is necessary, and I will trust that their basis for recommending euthanasia is done at the best interest for the animal to minimize the suffering. "
dxzkx99,LifeSad07041997,"I would support it if the patient is old and has been in coma for too long for any hope of recovery and wake up. If you're young, there's still hope that there's a possibility, since there are cases of patients waking up after 10 years of being in coma 

But of course it would have to be the doctor to recommend it, and a full agreement in the family to euthanasia otherwise it's a no go. 

(I'm taking a example from the Korean drama 'live', which in the show the co-actor's mom has been in coma and in life support for a long time and the father tried to disconnect but failed but the doctor later recommended euthanasia. The son's wife agreed, but son is still second guessing and prepare himself.)"
dxzvmov,Bloody-August,"I'm a cancer survivor. I know friends who have died of cancer. I am fully supportive of euthanasia. The pain I've gone through and the suffering I've seen/heard my friends gone through, it's really better to let them die with dignity. "
dxzhty7,Reaperosha,"Euthanasia is such a floodgate topic. Although  I support it as a means to end suffering, I don't think we can simply incorporate it into our everyday lives.
 From a medical point of view, Doctors are the ones responsible for euthanasia but usually after the patient has signed a document stating/allowing so.
From a nurse's/emergency response personnel poi, not resuscitating can also be seen as euthanasia.
If we talk about euthanasia, how far do we go between failing to save a life and allowing that life to die because it cannot be saved.

 Basically, euthanasia, allows the death of a person to be committed by another human person for the express benefit of the patient alone. The benefit here, is the removal of suffering if continuing to live becomes hard. Then comes the legal headache.... How far is suffering? Vegetable state? Needing medication/treatment to stay alive? Suffering of the family for maintenance or simply being around the patient? What about the signed document? How far can the document go in court if a son wants to fight for his father but the doctor and courts decide to grant the father's wish?

Furthermore. Euthanasia and murder. Not very far apart. One is legal(in some countries, Australia have just recently visited the topic and are coming up with legislation for it) and the other is not. Both define the acceleration of death of a person by another. The difference is the term medical. If death is a medically approved notion for poor health then it is allowed. There's also a really heavy element of ethics and morality but which sensitive topic does not."

Until legal euthanasia comes into play. Advanced Medical Directive is the best advice when you are still sane. It clearly tells the medical fraternity not to revive you or intervene if certain conditions are met. It removes the burden from family and relatives who naturally will intend to prolong and not be viewed by others as ending a life.

Instead, I think another factor as to why euthanasia is still not coming through is that the leaders believe there is a significant potential for it to be abused by the rich in order to obtain larger amounts of inheritance from the deceased in a dishonest way. You just need enough money to persuade the panel and in cases where millions of dollars worth of inheritance is at stake, you wouldn’t mind forking out a fortune to force it through.

Also, another factor could be that it is ingrained in our culture that care-not harm-should be applied to those who are vulnerable. Taking someone’s life away just because they are not worth being taken care of anymore can easily be made to sound like a heartless act."

obviously other cases are really clear cut, but the problem then becomes how can we specify criteria which allows for it, who gets to decide (the person the most informed- ie the doctor, or the person who is in control- the patient), and how do we manage evolving circumstances or changes. "

First, you can address the problem in many practical ways. You can require the decision to euthanise be contingent upon a doctor's (or doctors') expert medical opinion(s). You can link it with the existing advanced medical directive structure, so a patient can make the informed decision ahead of time such that their decision cannot be gainsaid. You can make the family members declare that they aren't up to no good, or criminalise their actions after the fact if they were. 

Second, it ignores the inverse perspective. How many offspring are frittering their resources away taking care of ailing parents who have no hope to live past a few months, who have no treatment options except palliative care, and whose quality of life has degenerated to the point where no sane human being would call it ""life""? Is this not the status quo being misused, to everyone's detriment?

The AMD indeed does not take away your life instantaneous, and you do indeed still suffer for your remaining days. However,  to be terminally ill with imminent death (criteria for the AMD, supported by 3 doctors) and kept alive by machines for prolonged periods could indeed be prolonging your suffering.

You can already do this without legalized euthanasia. The onus is on you to prove that the medical response team deliberately let the patient die.

dxzlfx4,ceddya,">One argument against euthanasia for terminal illnesses is that the better solution is to provide competent palliative and hospice care. There is no need for people to be suffering intolerable levels of pain.

Palliative care is not a panacea that cures all pain. Not only, the amount of opioids (i.e. morphine) needed to give some comfort can further reduce quality of life via the side effects. In some cases, it actually hastens their death.

More importantly, pain isn't the only thing that can reduce one's quality of life. Things like losing mobility or the agency to act independently are not things that palliative care addresses.

>And there is a danger that, since euthanasia is much cheaper, insurance companies and hospitals will push for euthanasia by making palliative/hospice care worse.

You don't see palliative/hospice care worsening in countries that have euthanasia.

>Furthermore, I'd ask how you'd respond to the fact that suicide is impulsive and nearly always regretted when it fails

People who commit suicide generally are those who have not explored all options through treatment. For those who regret it, I think it's fair to say that it was an impulsive decision.

Euthanasia requires that one has exhausted all treatment options and has approval from multiple independent doctors. More importantly, the wish to undergo it has to be explicitly stated and conveyed by the patient. In such cases, undergoing euthanasia is a calculated and carefully considered decision.

I honestly don't see how the two are remotely similar for the example regarding suicide to be applicable to euthanasia."

dxzshov,BreathOfTheOffice,"It's not just pain, it's the loss of their quality of life.

I've been to kidney centers, talked to the patients. Plenty of them still have their quality of life, and are happy there.

I've been to hospitals, talked to the patients. Many still have their quality of life, and were generally happy to continue living. There was one who came in for a CT scan, his entire family with him. He was at the point where we had to carry him onto the CT bed, had to be attached to a urine bag, and just stared ahead blankly. He didn't look happy, his family didn't look happy, but they were still seeking treatment because they had hopes he would improve.

I've been to hospices, places where many of the patients family doesn't even visit anymore. The vast majority were like empty husks of the people they were. They lay down or sat in a room, not making conversation, staring blankly at a television and waiting for their next meal. A sad sight to see is a gross understatement.

dxzlzfq,Reaperosha,"Ya I know what you are saying. Not disagreeing.  The point I am making is there is no written law in Singapore (that I could find) regarding euthanasia.

dxzntuu,sa_ranoutofideas,"Yet, we will return to the scenario where there may be some people who possess sufficient money and power to coerce the panel of doctors into acceding to the request of carrying out euthanasia AND are completely unwilling to seek alternative options for the required people so as to receive their inheritance (which may or may not disproportionately increase their wealth/power). How can this be prevented from happening?

I am not disagreeing with you btw. I just want to discuss this further and gain more insight to this issue. A solution might perhaps be to install a medical ombudsman of sorts between the people and the panel of doctors to provide a ""second approval"" on the request for euthanasia. However, a ""second verification"" might not ensure that the process of seeking a request was not perverted  with bribery. 

Moreover, in the event of a legitimate case for euthanasia (under whatever parameters that may be established for the legality of assisted suicide/killing), a longer verification process will inevitable mean a longer period of time that the person for whom euthanasia is intended for, is being forced to live."

dy1hk5s,sa_ranoutofideas,"> We can only hope that a patient is smart enough to help themselves and their doctors won't be too evil.

You see, the problem here is that there is too much room for error here. For abuse *not* to occur, *both* these conditions must be met. Hence, abuse can occur if *either* of these conditions are fulfilled. For Euthanasia to be legalized, we need to lower the risk of **both** these conditions:

* Patient is smart enough *i.e.* The patients have been provided with abundant information and ample time to assess any possible repercussions from their decision. 

* Doctors won't be too evil. Let's define that as: The doctors are trusted to make the appropriate, moral (Let's ignore religion for this hypothesis) decision.

If we want to prevent beneficiaries of the patients' Will from using their power or wealth to coerce doctors into acceding to the request of Euthanasia, a separate and independent (ideally, also anonymous) committee to approve the doctors' learned decision can lower the likelihood of the beneficiaries being successful. This is because they would have to coerce/bribe all the parties involved and we are increasing the number of parties involved in this process.

Initially, I thought that the increase in waiting time for the approval of Euthanasia would be a bad thing but I have now changed my mind. In this scenario where there is an abuse of the process, if the patient was in a great deal of pain and wanted to end his life, he would probably be granted his request (Stay with me here; I am working under the assumption that Euthanasia would be legalized to allow for the termination of life when the patient has been shown/seen/proven to be experiencing intense pain). Hence, the beneficiaries would only need to resort to coercion/bribery when it is not so straight-forward and there is a plausible conclusion of the request for Euthanasia being denied. In cases such as these, increasing the number of people involved in the process will ensure greater diligence and reduce oversight in the matter. I agree it is not a fool-proof solution because as you said, humans are involved and we are not perfect but once again, I'm looking at reducing the likelihood of the process being abused / increasing the risk for people attempting to abuse the process that they will be caught in their attempt. Finally, a longer processing time (for the patient who wants Euthanasia but is not in extreme pain) will also allow the patient to attend a higher amount of neutral sessions with various doctors/psychologists to think longer about whether he truly wants to go through this decision.

That is just my two cents. It turned out to be longer than I thought it would be lol.

e31rjqo,localbear,"Sounds like a typical kid's game. The only one who needed counseling was the kid who understood the word ""die"" literally."
e30h75y,Jammy_buttons,"

SINGAPORE - A primary school has told parents to stop spreading rumours about an incident involving some of its students on a school bus, after fears of a ""suicide game"" began to escalate.

Principal of Rosyth School, Madam Elis Tan, wrote to parents on Tuesday (July 24) after rumours circulated online about a game created by students on one of the school's buses, in which students receive ""happiness"" points for good achievements like receiving praise from teachers and lose them for bad behaviour such as not doing well at spelling.

On July 3, a Primary 1 pupil told friends he no longer wanted to take part in the game but they told him he needed to ""die"" from the game before exiting.

While all the others took ""die"" to refer to the end of the game, the Primary 1 pupil understood it literally.

He told his parents about it when he got home, and they informed Rosyth School, which then investigated and found out that nobody had been hurt during the game.

Students were told to stop playing the game.

However, various versions of the incident had begun circulating in various parent chat groups, causing alarm to some.

""The purpose of this letter is to clarify the incident,"" wrote Madam Tan. ""The school... would like to appeal to parents to stop circulating unverified accounts of the case.

""The students have been counselled and advised against the compulsion of others in the playing of games, and the use of loose language, which may be misconstrued and result in fear and anxiety.""

Businessman Seah Kwang Peng, 40, whose daughter is a Primary 3 student at Rosyth, received the letter on Tuesday.

""This is the first time the principal has sent such a letter out, so I assume the inaccurate chatter must have gotten too loud,"" he said. "" It is good that they've clarified it before the online rumours get out of hand.""

On Wednesday night, Rosyth School sent a message to parents, saying that it had just become aware of another rumour and was preparing a response to it.

The school did not explain what the rumour was, other than that it involved Primary 1 and 2 students playing an unsafe game.

dxqkkln,KiraWang,"Hi! I'm a trans girl currently taking HRT and transitioning. IMH actually has a Gender Clinic that was opened last year, and going by that route allows access to government subsidized medication and blood tests. Here's what you need to do to get access to the medication that you need:

1. Go to a polyclinic to get a referral to the Gender Clinic. This was easy in my experience - just use the most typical explanation even if it doesn't 100% reflect your experience (i.e. ""I feel like a woman trapped in a man's body"").

2. Wait for a few months till your appointment with the Gender Clinic. There are currently two doctors staffed at the Clinic and they are extremely professional and know their stuff. Don't feel worried about sharing with them. The one you consult will then refer you to an endocrinologist (mine is in Tan Tock Seng Hospital).

3. The endocrinologist will order a thorough blood test to check if it's safe for you to start HRT - most of the time it is. Once that's done, you can buy your first batch of medication.

And that's it! It's not that difficult to do it by the book, to my surprise. The cost is fairly manageable - a $70 charge for the once-every-three months consultation, and medication itself costs less than $30 per month.

If you need to be extremely extremely discreet for some reason, it's actually decently safe for most people to DIY, although I'd recommend against it. Here's a list of GPs that may help if you really need it: https://imgur.com/lbEpD2o

I wish you the best on your journey to be your true self!

P.s. as for the naysayers asking this person to reconsider, post-transition suicide is largely caused by societal transphobia, and detransition is still possible if the person regrets it (but very, very rarely happens). Please take a step back and reconsider your personal opinions on trans people - ownself check ownself. After starting my treatment, I have never been happier, and wish I had started earlier - but I did not, because of 20 years of internalized transphobia taught to me by society."

This is also different from those that  are sexually adventurous  or seeking to experiment or just curious - bi etc. That’s pretty much influence and to some extent lifestyle.

I'm not trying to ""bash"" the trans movement or anything, but I really want to make sure you've thought this through.

Will you feel the same way in 5 years? 10 years? It's hard to say, and there's no right answer, but you should definitely be entertaining these thoughts. If this is an easy decision for you to make then I'd argue that you haven't thought about it enough. According to [this](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf) paper, 42% of MtF people have attempted suicide, and this is in line with most of the other sources I've read.

You should definitely bring this up with your parents if you haven't already done so. I'm not trying to belittle your struggle, and by no means telling you not to attempt it, but I ask that you seriously think about what you're doing, as a lot of these effects can't really be undone.

Why this matters is because sometimes, they might refer you to doctors that aren't as experienced. I believe the polyclinic you go to and which medical group it belongs to also plays a part in which hospital you will be assigned to. In a strange twist of fate, the psychiatrist i was assigned to was the very same MO that was presiding over my SAF 
medical board meeting. While he has, by his own admission, seen a lot of cases like mine, his ideas are still a bit antiquated.

edit: added more details"
dxviqdo,polyetheneman,"if you’d like to go the private route, feel free to hit me up. you’d need your parents consent to start HRT though, costs are pretty high as well. 

wishing you all the best, i started transitioning medically when i was 18 as well. never regretted it a day in my life and actually last week was my 7 year on HRT anniversary! just hmu if you want a korkor to talk to or anything :)"
dxqbx1b,perfold7,"Hey, I know I'm going to get a lot of heat for this and I'm sure that you've already thought about it but are you *really very* sure you want to transition? You can't turn back ever again. Many people regret it. 
Make sure it's a decision you won't regret"

dxqqmvq,Tytaniss,"Thank you so much! You have been the greatest help thus far...

My school counsellor is in the midst of arranging a session for me with a professional regarding NS matters, but I'm not too sure if s/he will be specialised in HRT. I would really like to try experimenting as soon as I can so I am really grateful that you have given me the option to at least self-prescribe. Considering that you already have past experience with HRT, do you have any advice regarding frequency and dosage of intake?"

dxrk6v0,iamcathyy,Man that's awesome...I've been ordering online for over 10 years so far. Tried to go legit once but was turned away from IMH and they just flat out told me that they don't deal with transgender people.
dxtetz7,TimmmyTurner,"> IMH 
not sure if you're joking or for real"
dxqio4x,lisuga,i think you have to get a doctor to officially diagnose you with gender dysphoric disorder first to be exempted from ns.
dxqkli6,Tytaniss,"That is something I am also concerned about. My school counsellor is recommending that I seek a professional regarding this, but I am also afraid that I won't have too much time for more than one counsellor. Besides, I've heard that some transgender teens have done self-prescriptions as well."
dxqkbjs,Tytaniss,Thank you!
dxqigr3,lisuga,pretty sure the high percentage of suicide attempts among trans people is mostly because of transphobia and not because they regret transitioning? speaking as a non-binary person.
dxqnqrr,Tytaniss,"Thank you for being objective. I don't wish to be inconsiderate and air my dirty laundry regarding my past(it's not pleasant but it's not too terrible either), but my current surroundings don't play much of a big role into how I'm thinking. In fact, my coming out on social media recently hasn't garnered me much support from my schoolmates either, so I think it's fair to say that this is not something that I have suddenly thought of on the fly. I'll acknowledge that I'll probably not have enough social support(I only have a few friends from sec school, but we aren't in the same JC) and that it is going to be tough. However, I have harbored these thoughts since sec school regardless of the people around me, and considering that it is actually harsher in JC because of the lack of close friends, I am confident that I can face the future without my thoughts changing to where it would be societally convenient for me. "
dxqgtbi,always_say_birb,"Just some food for thought here. 


OP is 18 years old. Not a full grown adult in many peoples' eyes, perhaps, but surely capable of some critical thinking? Transition isn't a decision to be taken lightly for sure, but would just like to pose this question: do you think they are taking this lightly? Don't you think these concerns have occurred to them before? I'm sure you mean only the best intentions, and that care for others is something to be applauded! Not sarcastic. 


However, there is often a tendency in the public to view trans/LGBT people (especially youth) as somehow less able to think critically and make their own decisions. Might your concern stem from such an assumption? Just something to think about. "

dxqhbnn,HisPri,"Trust me, we will question ourseleves to the end of times. 

There is a meme that only transexuals think about their gender so much and constantly doubt themselves "
dxqcpuk,Axziol,i agree with these. The suicide rate of post-op trans is high. Most likely because they felt that they are in the wrong body and it feels worse after the op. 
dxql72j,KiraWang,"I actually decided on Kyra in the end, but can't change Reddit username ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
dxtnqtq,KiraWang,And what exactly about my comment is not believable?
dxqk9ul,Tytaniss,"I know how convenient it is at my age to declare that I am transitioning to escape NS, but that is the least of my concern right now. I won't say that I'm exactly OK with NS either, but I'm scared of having to conform too considering I will have to be around men. I have a school counsellor recommending that I get some kind of form from a specialist that refers me to more suitable vocations."
dxqkqc4,SepthSilver,"You're probably quite right, but as shitty as it is, they experience the effects of transphobia because they underwent the transition. That is not to say that the bullying etc that they might experience is in anyway their fault, but it is one of the realities of their life that they're going to have to face, and as such should factor into the decision making process."
dxqmq4t,Tytaniss,Thank you for the defense. I think I've gotten more flak than answers here. Maybe I should have gone to a more specialised local subreddit instead.
dxqlx77,SepthSilver,"I too am 18 years old, and just a few months ago I was going through a pretty bad time regarding school, and was considering dropping out. A friend of mine was considering suicide after his girlfriend of two years dumped his ass and hooked up with some other guy. Of course now looking back on it our behaviors were somewhat ridiculous and showed a complete lack of foresight, but nevertheless at the time our issues felt very real. These examples are completely annecodatal, but I think that any age(but especially youth), we are susceptible to becoming trapped in a certain way of thinking, and not giving due considerations to all possibilities. 

Of course I don't know anything about OP's situation other than that he's 18, but it appears that he's done mainly online research, and hasn't approached a doctor, therapist, or anyone with experience with this kind of situation. Hell a simple google search lead me to https://transgendersg.com/support/, which seems like a place where he could discuss his issues with people that know what they're doing. 

HRT fucks with your body. You will go sterile, and the breast growth is permanent. Outside of that there are also side effects on your liver, kidneys, as well as various cancer risks. If OP is going to go through with this, it should only be done after a lot of thought, and a little bit more planning that ""ok i'll buy these drugs, stick them in my body, and hope for the best""."
dxqk0e3,SepthSilver,I think that life becomes a lot harder post transition though no?
dxqdxd0,CarryingTrash,"In fact, the suicide rate before transition is similarly high. "
dxqgy64,HisPri,"That is a lie that was spread by TERF. 

Pre-op transexual has a much higher rate. "
dxqehxe,Cubyface,And tbh 18 seems like too young an age to be certain about any decision much less one that has a lifelong impact. Have you talked about your decision with close ones?

dxqm06l,lisuga,"sorry, i wasn't trying to accuse you of trying to escape ns! i know how tough and scary it is to go through ns as a trans person. i'm rooting for you and wish you all the best!"
dxqlof3,KiraWang,"Being trans is never convenient, and people that accuse you of transitioning to only simply avoid enlistment are stupidly close minded. I made the mistake of serving with dysphoria, and wasted another 2 years of potential HRT."
dxrvlv7,fatspitz,I'm jelly. Was from a time where had to serve as 302 :/ even though on hormones. Seems like it's better now.
dxql0f9,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,"Trans people can still be visibly trans (and not ""pass"") even before transition. For example, there are MtFs who use makeup but do not go on hormones or undergo any form of surgery- some of these MtFs can still pass (look like typical women) using only makeup, but some don't. You speculate that it is more difficult to ""pass"" as either gender after going on hormones, but the speculation is debunked by the reduction of the suicide rate from pre to post transition. 

Edit: there are also pre-transition MtFs who choose to look like men to avoid social stigma. However, many who make that choice struggle with unresolved gender dysphoria as a result, that makes their suicide rate much higher than those who choose to transition and try passing as women."
dz43ah0,anakinmcfly,"\>  they experience the effects of transphobia because they underwent the transition 

That's only a part of it. A large number of trans people commit suicide because they can't transition, Leelah Alcorn being one prominent case. Dysphoria does a large part of the work. Whereas suicide rates \(not lifetime suicide rates, which are cumulative and which your linked paper referenced\) fall drastically upon transition, once dysphoria is mostly or partly resolved."
dxqq2yq,Tytaniss,"Maybe I should have specified that I was currently seeking help from a school counsellor. 

I think I have a pretty good grasp of the potential consequences of transitioning as quoted from my other reply on this post, ""...my current surroundings don't play much of a big role into how I'm thinking. In fact, my coming out on social media recently hasn't garnered me much support from my schoolmates either, so I think it's fair to say that this is not something that I have suddenly thought of on the fly.

However, in regards to HRT, no matter how much online research that I have done, physically experiencing it is probably the only way to understand if I can handle it. 

Although it is my fault that I did not consider local transgender communities, there are reasons why I would rather put it as a last resort:
-It is mentally exhausting to convey whatever I have told my school counsellor to another counsellor.
-I would rather arrange a session with a professional instead of having to be referred to one after seeking help from said communities. School counsellor is in the midst of arranging a session for me anyway.

Maybe it was too rash of me to jump to the decision of taking medication before seeing a professional, but I have thought about this long enough to be able to accept the fact that I will have to bear consequences of the hormonal imbalance. Whether it is bearable or not is only entirely up to me to decide.

I don't want to seem like I will abandon this post but it is extremely tiring having to argue with others about ""if I'm sure about this"", when the main purpose of my post was to ask for help. Thank you for your concern nevertheless."
dxqkf0q,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,"Nope. MtF people pre-transition have much higher suicide rates than post-transition. 

Post-transition, they still have a higher suicide rate than the general population- this may be due to factors like persisting social stigma, and unresolved emotional issues. But it's a significant improvement from pre-transition. Across the internet, people keep severely misintepreting the above findings. They think that the post-transition suicide rate being slightly higher than general population = transition being bad for mental health, even though it's not remotely the same thing. In fact, the study that produced these massively misunderstood findings, recommended that the post-op transition suicide rate can be further reduced through family support and reduced social stigma, so it is a study that is very far from discouraging transition. The recommendation makes sense when you consider that post-op suicide rate is lower in socially accepting nations than transphobic ones.

The general trans suicide rate is high due to many factors, but mainly due to gender dysphoria. OP already has gender dysphoria. Hormones wont give OP dysphoria, in fact it is meant to reduce dysphoria by aligning a trans person's body image with their physical body."
dxqk8t1,HisPri,"Yah, life does become harder once we start the transition. 

But we are trans from the start. We don't decide that it is a good idea to transition. Who wants to play the game of life in extreme difficulty?"
dxqmm06,Tytaniss,"You are partially right; some things may not be the same anymore. However, you are also missing the fact that there are also other things that will change to be what the person has desired. Transitioning will never always turn out as a positive experience, there are some sacrifices to be made as well; that is what makes it such a big decision to make. As vague as my answer can be, it may be the best reply to those who do not experience the same issues."
dxqg6f9,always_say_birb,"This exactly. Being trans can bring with it a host of issues, many to do with social rejection and societal misunderstanding of their condition. That is often a big contributing factor to things like suicidal ideation etc.


A bit disheartened to see so many people here questioning OP's ability to discern for themselves whether transition is for them. "
dxqm9u9,Tytaniss,"This is something that has bothered me for some time, and I have only recently decided to see a school counsellor for some of my emotional issues, not only this one. Since primary school, I have never consulted or talked to my parents regarding my life, and I am still finding it extremely hard to start doing so. Considering that I have lived this long without parental guidance, I find it extremely awkward to seek their help. However, I do request that my counsellor convey our discussions to my parents, that is at least something I can do for them."
dxqnyuz,Tytaniss,Thank you!
dxqnyro,Tytaniss,"Thank you for your reply. If you don't mind, could you describe why it was a mistake? I am still considering if I should defer or not and any insights will be extremely valuable!"
dxqo3sm,SepthSilver,"I wish you all the best. With regards to your original question, from what I've found it appears that you have to go through a GP first to get a prescription. Apparently you can get Diane35 and Progynova from as young as 14. It is possible to order online but that brings with it even more risks. Good luck, and I hope things work out for you."
dxqgd70,CarryingTrash,"In their defense, 18 is a little too young to make a life changing decision like that. Of course no one here knows how much thought OP has put into this, but better safe than sorry I guess."
dxqls3e,Tytaniss,">

I don't know how to send a mass reply to everyone who has commented so I may repeat some of my points. These thoughts that I have, of being born in the wrong body, have been with me since the start of secondary school. I won't go into much detail, but the gist of it is that I preferred(and enjoyed) trying to conform to female ideals. I prefer displaying femininity over masculinity, and I believe it is a preference that doesn't require too much thought: what you see is what you like. I'm sure you have your own preferences that you may struggle to find a reason for.

As a self-conscious and anti-social individual, I have spent time that others would with friends, to instead observe and decipher how society acts. I'm well aware of the prejudice that the LGBT community has faced, especially trans people which is the group that I am in, and this is exactly the reason I was scared of asking; because people may not treat my wish seriously. 

Transgender hormonal therapy, which is the process of ingesting hormones to be more inline with the desired gender, is not as consequential or drastic as gender reassignment surgery, and I hope you all can understand that this is the first step for any serious transgender. After all, if we don't take the first step, how would we know if it would turn out for the better or worse? I am currently seeking a school counsellor regarding other emotional issues and have talked about this situation with her. 

Thank you to all who have taken the time and effort to reply!"

dvq3jwa,Jammy_buttons,Could be ST editors asked him to do it to remind peeps not to off themselves?
dvq5t7l,glublublub,"Not the original commenter, but several things irk me about the article. Firstly, his characterisation of ‘young people’ throughout the article tends to lean towards a somewhat condescending notion of adolescent suicide as a product of frivolous snap decisions and social anxiety. While these factors are certainly significant, the article neglects to consider the more structural and quasi-rational reasons youths may commit suicide, which may not be, as the article’s narrative thread purports, because they don’t feel ‘as worthy’ as their parents, or ‘over broken relationships, getting into trouble with the law, as well as difficult social situations’. 

In fact, despite stating in the article that less than a third of suicides among the young are associated with mental illness, he focuses the paragraphs immediately following that statement with an explanation of the mental illness side of the equation, without elaborating on the two thirds of ‘suicides of sound mind’. By doing so, he side-steps (or only lightly touches upon) a lot of the problematic structures undergirding Singaporean society (the societal focus on examinations as a determinant of self-worth, the highly conservative nature of Singaporean society and the intolerance of alternative lifestyles experienced by a generation with a perhaps stronger need than ever for a sense of individualism) and the influence of emergent digital trends which affect the current generation of digital natives more so than any other group in history (constant bombardment with negative global news and freer platforms of criticism for their own local government for instance perpetuating a greater sense of worldly alienation and scepticism, social media acting as an ideal platform for finding negative echo-chambers whereby such thoughts only multiply). 

A lot of young people nowadays don’t think of suicide necessarily because of circumstances like break-ups and failed tests; there is a looming sense of existential dread and worldly scepticism which I would say affects this generation to a significant degree, and can result in thoughts that life is simply just not really worth it.


In the concluding paragraph, he notes that ‘young people must understand that their lives are not determined by the number of likes on social media or the grades they obtain in school’. This is an incredibly condescending portrayal of youth suicide, and clearly demonstrates the fact that many in their parents’ generations genuinely don’t understand these feelings, and so attribute it to Instagram likes and bad test scores. As I said earlier, no doubt a significant number of people are affected by the issues presented in the article, but he neglects to talk at all about other perhaps larger and more complex factors underlying teenage suicide.


Secondly, his treatment of the emotional/mental side of suicidal thoughts and depression is somewhat poor. He begins first by stating, as the **first** (and thus implicitly most important) answer to the question ‘what is wrong with suicide?’ is that it’s illegal. That does not help anybody experiencing genuinely invasive suicidal impulses; at most, it may make them seek treatment out of fear, but it also reflects a governmental lack of concern with treating the underlying problems relating to suicide, and their solution to preventing it is to punish those in their most vulnerable state. I won’t go into a critique of this law here since the article isn’t taking a stance on it, but merely stating that it exists, but to use that as the first reason suicide is wrong shows a severe inability to empathise with those who may be going through such issues. 

In the next paragraph, as I mentioned earlier, even though he states that less than one third of suicides relate to mental illness, he literally only talks about suicide as caused by schizophrenia and depression, and does not discuss the remaining two thirds. This perpetuates again the notion that teenage suicide cannot be conceived of by a person of sound mind who has in some manner rationalised their thoughts towards suicide not because of circumstantial sadness, but genuine existential weariness. He also discusses the symptoms of suicide in very superficial terms, going into detail about being unable to concentrate on their studies, not getting sufficient sleep, and headaches and stomach-aches. While this may possibly prove useful in looking out for signs of depression, he does not mention the emotional, and in my opinion, more significant impacts of depression like a general sense of apathy, lack of self-worth, etc.

The thoughts I've mentioned here are admittedly anecdotal, coming from my own experience talking with friends about their depression, suicidal tendencies, etc., as well as my own personal struggle with it. In general, nothing he says in the article is *wrong* per se, but it's the same generic stuff youths have been hearing during school cyber-bullying and emotional wellness talks which have always, to me at least, only demonstrated an inability to grapple with the idea that teens may actually have very complex emotions regarding this issue rather than just a crippling unawareness of how to cope with basic life hurdles.

Edit: Read. Okay. Those parts were really terrible"
dvqe230,Bunglingmonkey,"Great read. I would say you're quite on point. Unlike the ""quality journalism"" we have "
dvqzr1m,acepincter,"It was very affirming to read your take on the article.  It remains a sort of media taboo to talk about an ""worldly skepticism"" and an ""existential dread"" that a young person might feel after examining the options and opportunities they are presented and found them lacking, inhumane or unfulfilling.  

Too often the conversation is dominated by the voices of adults and scientists shouting *towards* the ""troubled teens"" - and so rarely do we ever get a chance to read the thoughts and words of those contemplating it, possibly for fear that it would resonate perhaps a little too deeply.  To the troubled teen this must feel like everyone wants to tell them how to live, cope, think, and *no one at all wants to listen to them or their thoughts*.  That reality alone could be crushing enough to consider ending it.

I can't help but feel that we are treating only the symptoms, everywhere, while the causes continue to fester.  The truth, which we can't seem to accept, may be that:

We live in a world that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, and the best we can offer is to give them pills and therapies to take away their unhappiness.

The other two thirds, I would bet, are people who have come to learn this truth at great difficulty and personal expense.  So far, Dr. Jean Twenge is the only psychologist interested in *listening* to the cries of the troubled, hoping to find patterns in their plight that would give us actions to take.  

Last time I thought about killing myself was when I read about and saw the images of what my species did to the Great Barrier Reef, through neglect, short-sightness and hubris.  Is there a pill I could take to bring back that life, beauty, and splendor?

It must be mental illness, right?"
dvr3gdc,IntlMysteryMan,"You nailed it. Every word. As a man who once found himself in a field with a gun to his head pulling the trigger... It is about perspective, but ever so more importantly, purpose. 

Hope is a worn out and tired word. So are dreams, faith, etc. Give me something real, something tangible, that I can sink my teeth into, or even strike out against if I have been wronged sufficiently enough, and you have given me life.

We are asking our youth to be as ignorant as we were growing up, completely ignoring the fact that we made it possible and then taught them how to access all of the known knowledge in the universe with a few movements of their fingers. I’m past my prime and I am still struggling to wrap my head around what is going on. 

Talk to your kids. It is okay to not have all of the answers. It’s ok to fuck some things up. They will understand. Why? Because we set out to raise the greatest kids possible with the best resources available in human history and we succeeded.

(Possibly because of environmental factors, as Singapore wasn't doing too well many years ago)

What you learn during ur childhood sticks with you, because thats when you are empty of concepts and learning about the world. 

I would agree with you on your definition, however, for some people, their ""purpose"" in life is to be in tune with societies idealogies.

What is important is that we keep an open mind and accept everyone's viewpoints, because everyone has their personal perspective of what life is and what success/purpose means.

dtph9gw,TimidHuman,"The thing about this is that social stigma will still be there, that's probably why there are still many people who need help but are not seeking medical help.

Seriously we need to get rid of this stigma. People with depression or other sort of illnesses are not weird, or weak and should not be seen as inferior. It's just like a flu, everyone and anyone can get it, but if you leave it untreated it'll escalate into a major problem.

Though easier said than one, hopefully one day this stigma will be gone."

There were a lot of family issues at home, and he was also bullied by his peers for being “slow” and having a few tics. He’s been on anti-depressants since August, and yesterday was the first time in a long while since I saw him smile.

"
dtpnwq3,plumpig,"I started self harming at 9. Maybe it was a cry for help, maybe it was a bid for attention. But whatever it was, it was done right in front of my mum while wailing that nobody loves or understands me. I got slapped for ""being a nuisance"" and for ""creating drama"". 

The next year, I began acting up in school and got flagged to see the school's counselor. She was a lovely lady who tried her best but I clearly needed more than what she was qualified to deal with. So in this way I muddled on, with everyone but my parents seeing that I needed help, until I turned 14 and decided to illegally work part time to pay for my own treatment. Maybe that intervention came too late, or maybe my family's escalating drama played a role, but it took a hell of a loooonng time, including a couple stints in both the kids' and adults' wards at IMH, for me to work through my issues. 

I'm not writing this to poke at my parents - they had their own problems and just didn't have any resources left to deal with a difficult 10 year old - but to urge any parent, or teacher, or school counselor reading this to notice, really notice your children. Late-early to middle childhood is not too early for depression to set in. I don't mean to rush your child to a therapist the moment they say, ""mummy I'm soooo sad!!"". But observe your children, make yourself available for them, don't discount their feelings, and if something seems wrong, *get them help*. 

I know there's a stigma attached to seeing therapists but seriously, the stigma isn't really there when the patient is a kid. Nobody (I hope) looks at a troubled kid and goes, ""oh it's because kiddo is weak, kiddo just needs to pull himself together"". And even if they do, so what. A kid who's getting help is better than a dead one or one that's irreparably damaged because help came too late.

I think it's especially more troublesome and difficult to deal with when it's about kids. As older people, we have more knowledge about depression and are more likely to be able to self-diagnose ourselves or to actively seek help. As compared to us, kids may not understand what they are going through and not be able to properly voice out their feelings to their parents. 

That's why I was really impressed and happy when Doreen Kho noticed that sometime was amiss and actually went to address it. I hope that with increasing awareness these days, parents and children alike will not be afraid to speak out, to take care of each other and to seek help when needed. 

Thanks for the additional resources too"

You, on the other hand - actually suffering some misery for once in your meaningless life might do you some good.

The most important thing is to be honest and not to withhold any information. If you're scared that they won't take you seriously, you can look for those family service centres. When I was kicked out myself, the service centre I visited really helped me out, they got me my first cheap rented room on the night I visited them. They might definitely be able to send you to one of those foster homes for boys with broken families. We visited one of them, and the people who stay there mostly all your age
If you really need help I can definitely meet up with you and talk more about your situation. Shit is scary man, I've been there!"

Basically, i used tinder overseas and connected with this singaporean girl who has lived there her entire life. We met a few times when she came to SG. We've been texting nearly every single day for around 10 months and I think she's too infatuated with me. 

She's studying overseas now too and occasionally tells me of her suicide thoughts and says she has told no one else and will never tell anyone else. She'll keep on asking for affirmation and if i don't provide it, she'll tell me on the day itself and soon i'll see her saying life isn't worth living and she'll cry and share her suicide thoughts. I like her as a friend, but I always made it clear to her i'm not willing to do a LDR, and right now I feel she's holding her own life ransom and continuously asking me to show online affection to her. I'm VERY worried for her and i don't want to see her sad too, but not to the point of entering a relationship with her and in fact I keep telling her not to be too attached to me, but then she'll think ""does that mean you're not into me"" and the whole suicide thing comes up again. 

Would REALLY appreciate any advice. I'm very lost and have no idea how to handle this situation. Your advice can change a life. Thank you."

Back to my review, the comedy is considered cheap BUT I enjoy cheap humours as long as it is done in the right way LOL. I'd say if you are a simple person who enjoys simple movie, then you'd most probably like this movie. I laughed most of the time at their jokes, so did the other people in the cinema. If you are more into the critical side, you'd most probably won't like this movie as it can really be cringe-worthy heheh. but I like it that way :D Of course the books are always better. I've always been a fan and vivid reader of 'DoAWK' and to top it off, this is a great escape movie from typical science-fiction/action movies.

dib3rkn,throwingdaisies,"Asking on behalf of a friend -

My friend took up a job as a private tutor from an agency and she begun teaching this jc girl in chemistry. The class was supposed to start at 5pm but my friend arrived at 4.50pm at their condo. 

(For those who are unfamiliar, condos have security which doesnt allow any random person to walk into their premises. Someone from the inside has to confirm they know the person) 

She contacted the student's mum and asked for help with verification,but the girl's mum said, ""I'm busy,no choice you must wait"". The student and the student's dad was also at home,and apparently the dad came down,supposedly to fetch her but failed to do so. 

Then they begun the lesson which was supposed to last 1.5h, but the mum intersected at the one hour mark and said my friend couldn't teach because she spent 30min on one question (she spent the other 30 minutes on 6 other questions) and since ""she couldn't teach well, I will have to terminate her"" (in a rather lengthy, entitled text full of short forms) and so she refuses to pay for my friend's efforts (my friend printed worksheets and notes and went to revise the subject for it) nor for my friend's travelling fees. 

My friend approached her agency but her agency decided to not do anything about it. 

For the record, my friend has consistently remained in the top 5% of the college and the only ""U"" she got is the U in the word ""uni"". So it's v ridiculous the mum of the student will say something like that, and my friend is pretty upset about it because she got slandered and had her efforts went unpaid. 

Any advice on what she should do next? Thanks everyone!!

Tldr ; friend went to work for private tuition from agency, student's parent refused to pay even after my friend went through troubles teaching her kid, said my friend couldn't teach/don't know her stuff when my friend literally stayed in the top 5% of the jc the whole two years"

If you guys think it's because you're ugly.. you're not wrong, but you're not exactly right either. Girls are generally less likely to prioritize looks in their partners as compared to guys.

The most common answer is actually linked to that [article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) someone posted a while back. 

Short answer, because you can't offer anything. You're nice? There's another thousand nice guys in front of you man, queue up. You're rich? You just instantly eliminated half of the guys in the ""Nice"" queue. But there's another half who's richer than you. You're witty? Okay, you've moved up another couple hundred places, but you're nowhere near the top.

I'm saying that not to tell you that you have to be witty, charming, rich, good-looking and nice to attract someone. Realistically, she's not going to go for the richest and most good-looking guy, of course. No one is that shallow, and if they are, you're better off looking for someone else anyway. But if you have even one of these qualities, you stand out.

The sad truth is, the world sucks and everyone is selfish. They like people that can offer them things - whether it be validation, money, status, humour, etc..."

But I have to disagree with you on your last paragraph though. The thing is, the problems we have in life aren't gonna be solved in any other way *except* by confronting them.

The fact that you have to preface your post with that ridiculous disclaimer despite knowing full well that you are posting in a public space shows that the issue lies with yourself and not anyone else.

However, army life is not for everyone. If you can handle it, go for it because the economy right now is pretty shit. "
dibh0b0,rheinl,"first... it is likely you will need a car because army camps are damm ulu, there goes your lump sum. theoretically money should be easy to save in army... but for some odd reason you start spending more... cigarettes.. thai disco... dabble in some stocks but dont do well because you are surrounded by wrong crowd. extreme boredom makes you decide to do a part time masters after work... now you really can't give up that car and guess where that generous yearly bonus is going to? 

by the time your term is completed, you are jaded and want to get out... you have a masters but no relevant working experience... bank account not too big either.. feels like square one all over again but at least you had a good life exp right!"
dibed7v,sakeoftheshow,Signing on isn't a bad thing - just that some people don't like the hierarchy thingy in army. Not everyone is cut out for the army life.
dibfoys,MateenLOL,"Go jer..where you signing on? Army/SPF/SCDF?

Also I dont understand some people who say signing on sucks but then works in a mundane 8-6 desk job"
dibfakt,csm133,"Only potential issue I heard is that once you sign on and spend a lot of time in the army it may be difficult to find a job in the private sector (Skill compatibility) and that if you do, you may yourslef starting over from the bottom again. So it may be hard to leave the army once you sign on. 

But this is hearsay, so take it with a grain of salt
"
dibgcud,wasteofrice,"just know that regular life and nsf life is vastly different - that's probably one of the gripes some might have with signing on. this means experiencing more of the bureaucracy that you've already experienced as an NSF, and working with all kinds of people can be draining (especially NSFs)."

> There is a special focus on trade-ins as well. Trade-in old tech like laptops for cash discounts at CEE 2017, old backpacks for Challenger vouchers and used PEVs for up to S$300 of MOBOT vouchers. Looking to declutter? CEE 2017 may be where you should head to first. Be sure to read up on the terms and conditions first so you don't lug your heavy equipment over for nothing.

> On the other hand, there’s the PC Show, which prides itself as Singapore’s longest running IT fair. It’s even found itself the very prestigious Marina Bay Sands as its location, which will definitely give it a good name.

> You’ll find plenty of reputable names setting up booths here, and be overwhelmed with discounts aplenty.

> The PC Show sets itself apart with its theme, #Techgether, which seeks to showcase amazing tech so families and people can come together to learn and experience. As cheesy as the hashtag is, it's a nice way to package and direct the whole event. "

dibllyk,,can cfm I used this website for my krw exchange just 12 days ago accurate representation 
dibr3bt,stevenquartz,sorry forgive my lack of knowledge but what would I/D be? it's been three days but we just gave him probiotics today so would it be fine?
dibr0yg,stevenquartz,have been feeding him boiled chicken only bc he doesn't have a liking for rice :/ I'll try adding the rice next! he also has been eating his normal dog food along with the bland chicken though
dibrlzt,stevenquartz,"yes doggo has a nice bowl of water to drink to prevent dehydration :( but it's been a few days, so it's okay to wait out a few more days?"
dibef1e,Nicopii,"It's an accident, and they're quite adamant on blaming me. There's some errors I can admit to, but if I were to say, I feel that both parties to be blamed. I don't think my friend is a bad person. I think my friend's friends are people I don't want to associate with. Tolerate or not, can change or can't, I really don't know her well enough to know that. "
dibc3p0,Nicopii,"I don't even know how to start the convo. I only have a rough idea like ""Oh hey hi. Are you still angry at me""... 

Oh my god I don't know what I'm doing. I'm in this dilemma but it shouldn't be a dilemma at all. If she's crossed with me being this ""awful"" guy for unreasonable reasons, I think the right thing to do is to back out and move on, but still I still want to talk to her zzz. Like you know, pretend shit didn't happen, cuz it's quite petty. I want to drop it and continue as friends? But I don't think the other party (in fact rarely anyone) would even bother at all. It'll be so awkward, so stupid looking of me, and stir up another set of problems, but I'm just curious. Sigh. "
dibe407,Nicopii,"Eh, I'm actually facing a similar situation like you. Just that.. it's her friends who took everything too seriously and personally. Like I didn't even go out to offend them. There was an accident that nobody could have prevented and perhaps I handled it in a bad way, but I did what I would normally have done. They took it so damn personally like I'm a bad person. So they complained to my friend like I'm the biggest creep in the world, and my friend got angry at me??¿?¿

True dat I was really angry for the first few days. It's very petty of them, it's very petty of me. But at the end of the day, I feel it's a waste to have to walk away from people I enjoy talking to and hanging out with over this kind of stupid things. And that's why I feel like, idk just forgive her and try again. But not exactly the smart and right thing to do.. :( 

The situation really made me question myself a lot. But alright I'll learn :( "

dibc8op,ElyrionW,"No. The disclaimer wasn't meant as a contradiction, of course. My point is that it turned out to be a contradiction and is quite indicative of your inherently mentality. 

Of course I can't support whatever your psych is saying with ""evidence"" lol. But if he's the one who is treating you and has had extensive contact with you and that you are the one who is paying him for his time, I'd be inclined to believe that he isn't lying to your face. 

Not many people thrive in regimented environment but people put up with it because they are mentally strong or they choose to be mentally strong. There many problems in life that you will encounter as an adult that will be much tougher than whatever you faced in army because there are actual lifelong consequences to those problems. The army makes it really hard for you to run away because there are plenty of hoops to jump through to get downgraded but in the working world, it's much easier to just resign and go because you can't deal with the random bullshit. From that perspective, you're going to keep running away because it's much easier to do that outside. "

Just choose the most expensive ticket to buy and when you are asked to insert coins/notes, put in your small coins until the total value is $2 and cancel the thing.

dibdpi2,MrEleventhHour,Mint candy/medicated oil tends to help with nausea. 
dictp32,chiotkk,"It's a kind of dog feed specially for gastrointestinal problems. If not, just keep him on his usual diet without anything else special (like treats), along with plenty of water. As long as there isn't worms or blood in the diarrhoea it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Again, look for a vet if it persists for more than a week."
dibujfk,lunaelly,"I would not give him his normal dog food at the moment. Avoid any strong tasting food, and yes, no treats at all! Just feed him steamed chicken until he has gotten better. Also, you might want to cut down on the amount of food given. This is to let the stomach rest. 

As for him behaving normally, some dogs do not appear lethargic and will continue to act as per normal. This is a basic animal instinct, it is so they will not appear ""weak"". With dogs like that, once they start appearing lethargic, the time starts to tick down and by the time you notice them, it could be too late. I really would suggest your family to get him to a vet if he isn't better by the morning. 

(one of my dogs had diarrhea very regularly for months so I'm very familiar with my vet and doggy diarrhea & they really advise you to bring pets who have diarrhea in so they are able to diagnose and treat asap. She was also very bouncy and playful and did not act like she was sick at all. But she was found to be quite dehydrated and the acids in her stomach were really high.) "

dibowbf,chiotkk,Honestly no idea lol.
dibd8mq,chiotkk,"I'm trawling around trying to find answers too hahaha. If anything there's definitely gonna be freebies on top of your purchase (extra value for money), though I'm not sure if it'll be significantly cheaper at these fairs compared to normal retail prices. Also the fact that there are two concurrent fairs will probably mean a more manageable crowd, so there's that."
dibdn61,MrEleventhHour,"Imo It depends on what you're looking for. There are some electronics that are actually cheaper if you buy it elsewhere. If you see the same vendors from SLS at the IT Show, it's actually much better to go to their main stores at SLS. The crowds at IT shows really suck. 

During the previous IT show in march, I went down to the Audio-Technica booth expecting a cheaper price than what Stereo offered. Boy, was I wrong. They sold the IEMs at retail price and threw a bunch of useless freebies in. Made my way down to Stereo on the same day and bought my IEMs from them instead. "

In the grand scheme of things, how much does looks matter? At my age (I'm 17) it matters a lot, but since looks fade over time, is there a point in the future where it matters way less than now? When/what age was that point for you if so? I think I'm average/slightly below-average looking, and it's sometimes a little depressing especially when I go on social media, instagram etc and see others, since most people who are good-looking are attached.

dicoqdx,workticktock,"Oh god, I wish I were so young again.

I'll be honest, most Singaporeans seem to be quite shallow. I'm Singaporean too, so I'm not being biased or anything. Looks matter more than they should. They're right after all, first impressions do matter.

But your first impression is more that just how you look, it's also how you hold yourself, how you speak and interact with other people. Even at your age, your character can substitute for looks. However, don't expect your peers to feel the same way. But don't worry, people mature over time, and expectations change. 

In general, I feel that you're right - that your age group really values looks. Looks started mattering less to me as I broadened my horizons and met more people over time. Basically, growing up. It wasn't a definite time. You know by now that looks don't equate character. But you might not feel how true it is until you fully realize it for yourself. Some people never realize at all.

Another thing, unless I'm mistaken, social media has been scientifically proven to make you feel more depressed about your life. I'm at work now so I can't find the link, perhaps later when I get home. But it makes sense, you're viewing the highlight reel of other people's lives. Moments where they are at their best. Daily life isn't that way, and thinking you're not as happy as your peers seem to be isn't going to improve your own mood.

Anyhow, I'm not thaaaat old (i think? D= ), so that's just how I feel now. Who knows, my perspective might change again as I age =)

"
dib88vz,CervezaPorFavor,"Oic. I thought you were referring to just collection at the post office. 

I've heard of a few cases of ""attempted deliveries"" when people were in. "
dib97vc,floraltoblack,"Shit. This is sounding out way too much like me.. I honestly can't give you the answer since everyone is different but I'll just share with you my personal experience I guess. 

I know I'm an asshole but I get hot and cold with pretty much everyone I meet, regardless of how much I like them. It's just how I am I guess, my mood fluctuates a lot. I go through periods where I love hanging out with someone, then getting annoyed by absolutely anything they do. I honestly cannot help it, I don't want to be an ass to them but sometimes I just find them so irksome during my cold periods. Yet during my hot periods, I can talk to them for hours and hours on end. 

There might be an undiagnosed mental health problem with me, or maybe I'm just an asshole. Idk. If she's anything like me, I guess it's just up to you to see if you like her enough to push through the trouble. 

Quick edit: also to add on to my previous response. Might it be social anxiety? I used to text some people ALL DAY every day but whenever we actually meet up, I would turn into an awkward potato literally. It was so painful because we were great friends, but I really just wasn't comfortable enough with their presence yet to truly let go irl. "

dicdda8,Ipublic,"Sorry for the late reply man, yup i don't mind sharing my experience tho. 

So, yeah like you, my friend(A) was being rather sketchy not disclosing the company's name. Only showcasing one of their website, the aegle wellness tcm website for me to look at. But in the end, I decided to meet A at his workplace.

So it just happened that went I went to meet A at koufu, i chanced upon my other friend B. B is a friend of mine during ns. He apparently introduced me to elusyf during one of the talk cock session we had. The only difference was that B didn't pressured me into joining or meeting up with him. He was just sharing some infomation about elusyf. 

So when A and B saw each other and B pointed to me, I knew at that point they were working for the same company. At that point, I was feeling betrayed, i meant like why A wouldn't tell me the name. Why was he so scared of saying the name.

Nevertheless, i went along to the company to have a look. So, A settled me down and talk about the company and its history. A went to bring another colleague of his (C), to come and talk to me more in depth about the company. After the brief introduction, they brought me into another room for a more senior colleague to do an intro.

The Senior colleague eventually came, gave a talk about the company, its methods of earning and how to join them.

After the talk, A and I went to sit at one of the tables and A shared about his goals and dreams. 

Eventually, I declined joining and left the company.

So basically that was the brief experience of the day you would have if u went. 

My two cents is : MLM isn't a scam, its just a business model that is prevalent in today's society. It's the tactic and methods that most salesman under the MLM brand used that brings a negative light to the business model itself. Not everyone is cut out being a salesperson. Just like not everyone is cut out being a doctor, runner or a swimmer. Their method is to entice youngsters by using the get rich scheme, how to earn 3x your peers after uni or be able to financially retire by the age of 35 blah blah blah.

But then again who am I to determine what the society can do or not do. If u strongly believe that since you were born, you were given the gift of gab and is able to market yourself very well to get people to buy your products. By all means go ahead, MLM could be the thing for you. However, don't make the decision on the day itself, also give yourself some time to think about it, make a calculated decision. True, you may ended up at a lower tier of the pyramid scheme if u didn't sign up today but if you got the necessary expertise and capabilities, even those in the lower tier can earn more than those in the higher tier. It just that the difference of tier is just the how much commission the higher tier can take from the lower tier every time the latter makes a business deal.

Probably the person who asked you are one of the many innocent victims that fell for it. hahaha"

dicdz3k,lunaelly,"Only when the diarrhea has completely stopped would I say he's getting better. If you're convinced that he is getting better and his diarrhea is stopping, monitor closely for today. If by evening he is still having (even if it's just a little), bring him to the vet. 4 days of diarrhea is no joke. 

The vet will most likely ask you if he's eaten anything, might do some testing bc some virus will cause your dog to get diarrhea, then give him some pills to stop the diarrhea. Let the vet know that you have probiotics, though I think the one that they give is much better bc they will look at your dog's weight and advice you on how much to give. If your dog's condition is really bad (like mine was), they might ask you to stop all the food given for about a day and make you give him a special digestive can food for the next few days. 

I went to the Mandai Mount Pleasant vet clinic, if you'd like to know which clinic I went. 

Try not to give him any food for today and monitor 'til evening. If without any food he's still having diarrhea, most likely his stomach acids are working on his stomach lining. "

Yeah, I've minimised my usage of social media, however I still feel slightly down when I'm in public and I see some guy who's really good-looking? Then I start to think weird shit like I don't mind being 15cm shorter if I looked like him? Or something like no matter how much I improve myself, I'll never be that good-looking? 

Yeah that sounds really weird when I type it out, I mean I don't know when these thoughts started, I think I'm getting really worked up over my looks when it's something I can't change? Not sure how to stop thinking about it though, especially since even if I quit social media, whenever I go out and see someone better-looking I think like this.

Not sure about your perspective changing again as you age, but you and some people around your age and even much older that I've met all tell me to chill and say that looks don't matter because looks fade anyway, so developing a good personality is more important? Not sure what to think of that

dicrinv,workticktock,"No worries, I know I'm old. Just clinging on to the notion that I'm still young XD

It's true that looks affect how people interact with you. Attractive people seem to have an easier time in life. But with attractiveness comes problems as well.

For example, imagine you're rich. Assuming you're not an absolute asshole, you're going to have plenty of ""friends"". In fact, you'll have plenty of them even if you *are* an ass. And one day, when you suddenly lose your financial status, how many of them are left?

It's the same with looks, those who don't mind spending time with you despite your looks are the ones who matter. You might look good now, but it might not last. To be fair, some people still look good even when they age, and manage to make it last a long time. Not everyone can do that, and like you said, there's only so much you can do about your looks.

I think a more important question to ask yourself is, why are you placing so much importance on looks? If it's because you're lonely, attractiveness doesn't guarantee a partner - sure it makes things easier, but you can't be sure your partner is attracted to your looks only, or to you as a person. That can be a problem as well.

That being said, there's no right or wrong on the importance of looks. Some people just value it more, some people just value it less. People's opinions differ, and it's just how it is. I'm just presenting my opinion on how I feel about the topic =)"

No problem. My dog was so sick for months and having diarrhea repeatedly. I stayed up with her every night, brought her out to poop every hour (yes, even at 3am). She would vomit and cry throughout the night. It was so exhausting, I hope no-one ever goes through this.

Even after passing I was very bad at U-turns. Had to go to the higher levels of my MSCP to practice.


>Oh wait, I started in the last week of April.
Still super fast though.

Anyway I think non-SCDF 2B is very hard to pass. I don't think there's enough practice. I think I only managed to pass because we were given free rein to just go around the circuit on our own multiple times a day, so I could keep practicing at what I was bad at.

Which are you weaker at? My weakest was plank because it was very hit-or-miss. Managed to practice it so many times I ended up coming up with my own technique to nail it almost every time lol. 

Was pretty bad at figure-of-8 too, until I realized even at 20-30kmh you can really lean and you still won't fall. I went so low one time I even scraped the crash bar against the floor lol

diap2ze,airawear,What I just said lo lol. 
dib06zv,triface1,"For the plank, really accelerate when you're trying to get up the plank. You need good speed to stabilize yourself on the plank. Then when you're on the plank, you can play around with your rear brakes to slow yourself down. 

One mistake a lot of us make (myself included) is thinking too much about the timing, so we end up going slow right from the start. Slow + inclined surface means a lot of wobbling, and sometimes we wobble so much we immediately drop off the plank right after getting on.

My technique to stay on the plank at a low speed once you're up: Once you're on the plank, try wobbling your handlebar left and right quickly. Of course, YMMV lol"
dm24psx,Romanion,Thanks for the tips! Finally passed on my first try! Now dilemma what bike to get. Considering the MT15. Which did you get?
dm2yv8u,triface1,"Nice. 

I believe MT15 has a recall going on. Looks pretty cool though. 

I got the CB190R, which also has its host of problems. There's also a recall going on for some of the bikes. This bike has a very sporty look, but the handlebar is still high enough that it's not as uncomfortable as a real sports bike. Maintenance is also dirt cheap. Servicing only have to change spark plug and engine oil.

If I could make the decision again, I'd probably go with the FZ150i. Rooted in the FZ16 which is an old bike, but don't think it's as problematic. "
dm3brtv,Romanion,"I looked through the sg mt15 FB group and haven't found any issues so far. Everyone seems pretty happy about their bike. Mileage seems great as well at around 40-45km/h.  

I think maintenance for most 2b bikes are pretty affordable?"
dm3es3s,triface1,"My mileage hovers around 43km/l, except for one time it spiked up to 69km/l. Still not sure why, but the math don't lie lol

Yeah, I guess most 2b bikes are affordable to service, unless they have carburetors and/or are 2-stroke. Even then it's not *that* expensive. My friend who rides a CB400 says his servicing costs $100+ each time lol"
dm3x0we,Romanion,Well the cb400 needs 4L of engine oil so that might be the reason. 43km/l is pretty good. Didn't expect it to be so efficient.

She managed to borrow enough money for a flight there but the guy refused to show up at the airport upon her arrival.

>          A Singaporean woman who flew to Taiwan to meet her online lover tried to commit suicide by jumping from a multistorey carpark when he failed to turn up, according to Taiwanese media reports.
The Straits Times understands that the 37-year-old woman is surnamed Chew and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is aware of the case.
The incident occurred at around 12.30pm on Thursday (Dec 28) in Taiwan&apos;s Taoyuan city, at a multistorey carpark in Zhongli District&apos;s Yanping Road, Shin Min Daily News reported on Friday. She was reportedly standing on the parapet at the roof of the five-storey-high carpark.
Taiwan&apos;s Apple Daily news site said the police received a call about the incident and rushed to the scene, along with the civil defence force, which dispatched a fire engine equipped with stairs.
The police were unable to get near Ms Chew as she was in an unstable mood, Apple Daily reported.

I agree, but if good palliative care is insufficient, where is the compassion in forcing people to endure such diminished quality of life?

By all means, ensure strict regulation to prevent abuses, but I've never really understood why people support a blanket ban on euthanasia."

>         Dec 20, 2017, 5:00 am SGT I agree with Professor Chong Siow Ann that both palliative care and euthanasia have the same intent and purpose - to alleviate suffering ([A good life to the end, or a quick death](http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/a-good-life-to-the-end-or-a-quick-death); Dec 16).
Legalising euthanasia need not inhibit the advancement in palliative care. In Belgium, about one death in 20 results from euthanasia, yet integrated palliative care services thrive there.
Allowing the choice between euthanasia and palliative care need not violate the core tenet of ""first, do no harm"". Euthanasia would help a patient in the last stages of a terminal illness under palliative care die peacefully and avoid the traumatic experience of dying of dehydration or starvation.
It is a traumatic experience, even for the loved ones. I was distressed to hear that one of my terminally ill relatives was not given even water during her last days at a hospice three years ago.
Everyone aspires to a good life to the end. But it is highly unlikely that a patient with untreatable and unbearable pain, and having lost his desire to eat or drink, would live a quality life.

drk280g,,"I absolutely agree. How we die is just as important as how we live. 

I never knew much or thought much about palliative care until I started working for an organisation that does palliative care. It is not about prolonging the patient's life but it is about making sure the patient live with dignity and have a good quality of life till their very last breath. Apart from medical care, it is also about providing that psychosocial and spiritual support that palliative patients will need towards the end of their life."

religious fanatics?

same as abortion. 

talk 24/7 about how life is gift from god etc. anti abortion and euthanasia but wont spend time volunteering at old folks home/orphanage or wont donate for such causes to make beneficiaries lives better. 

worst is the creeping religion into secular space. some MPs started making speeches in parliament against abortion say what let the women seeking abortion be 'psychoed' into giving away baby for adoption instead. 

like this champion. never see him care about single parents with kids out of wedlock finding it hard to get hdb flats or how too make singapore more child friendly. (maybe i missed it.) but can come to parliament and talk about such nonsense.

Summary by SMMRY:

> Empirical studies of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in the Netherlands and the United States indicate that pain played a relatively minor role in motivating requests for assisted suicide.
> 
> The slippery slope argument contends that even a relatively conservative law like the Victorian model would evolve over time, becoming more permissive and with the right to receive assisted suicide extending to many others: from physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill and fully consenting adults to euthanasia for patients who cannot give consent - the unconscious, severely disabled children, and the mentally ill.
> 
> The slippery slope argument also raises a practical concern: If assisted suicide were legalised, there must be regulations to ensure that a patient's decision for suicide is informed, competent, and made without any external coercion.
> 
> I'm troubled by the potential effect that the legalisation of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would have on doctors should such measures become routine and we become too comfortable in prescribing and giving injections to end life.
> 
> Professor Ezekiel Emanuel writes: ""Providing the terminally ill with compassionate care and dignity is very hard work. It frequently requires monitoring and adjusting pain medications, the onerous and thankless task of cleaning people who cannot control their bladders and bowels, and feeding and dressing people when their every movement is painful or difficult. It may require agonising talks with dying family members about their fears, their reflections on life and what comes after, their family loves and family antagonisms. Ending a patient's life by injection, with the added solace that it will be quick and painless, is much easier than this constant physical and emotional care.""

drk1jbr,HornyCaitlyn,"I sometimes wished Christians could just set aside a whole Christian “sharia law”, just for themselves, on top of existing laws. Laws that exclusively apply to people of their own faith. So that people need not be subjected to Christian beliefs. "
drjufns,mammothboot,Wow...didnt knew this kind of Mindset was in the Sg MP. Which LKY strongly condemns. 
drkdumd,5urr3aL,"Just curious, what are your strongest reasons for why you feel abortion is necessary in Singapore?"
drki2fv,MagosBiologis,"The standard Christian view on abortion and euthanasia doesn't require any religious beliefs at all. It's based on the premise that human life is always precious and shouldn't be intentionally destroyed.

The standard Western liberal view that abortion and euthanasia are justified requires the premise that human life is *not* always something to be preserved, and that there are cases where human life should be intentionally destroyed for the greater good.

Both premises can be held by anyone regardless of the presence or absence of religion. But the typical online pro-abortion/euthanasia argument typically ends up with someone going ""lol religious fanatics"" without actually trying to justify their premise that it can be morally justified to intentionally end human life, or alternatively that human life can be creatively redefined in ways that are not acceptable in biology (""Sir, we've found a plant on Mars! That's alien life!"" ""Nope, it doesn't have a nervous system and can't feel pain, it's not a living organism."")"
drkig1l,MagosBiologis,"Incidentally, a slippery slope argument is only a fallacy when the chain of related events isn't justified. E.g. ""how can you let your child drink Coke, next thing they'll be snorting cocaine!""

When it comes to euthanasia, the slippery slope more of documented history than a fallacy. Some European countries like Belgium and the Netherlands allow the euthanasia of children. Children who are assumed to be too immature and irresponsible to manage their own alcohol consumption, sexual relations, employment, voting, or even medical procedures, but somehow assumed to be mature enough to choose their own death.

> #####By Won Ho-jung

> Incheon Airport and Singapore Airlines are facing protest from a family after a passenger reportedly suffering from mental illness jumped from the fourth floor of Incheon Airport&apos;s concourse while waiting for a transfer flight to Los Angeles in mid-December.

> The man&apos;s family claims that Singapore Airlines, which operated his flight, and Incheon Airport Corporation should be held responsible, according to news reports.

> The 52-year-old American man, who was travelling in Thailand, decided to return to his home in Los Angeles when his bipolar symptoms reportedly became more severe. His family reportedly wrote to Singapore Airlines to alert them of his condition and ask for special attention.

> The man&apos;s symptoms raised concerns among flight crew on the flight from Thailand to Incheon Airport, according to the air carrier.

> ""Our cabin crew managed to calm and control the customer, who was handed over to airport security staff upon arrival in Seoul,"" Singapore Airlines said in an official statement. ""Singapore Airlines apologises to the customers on the flight who were affected.""

> While waiting for a transfer at Incheon Airport, Singapore Airlines decided that the man needed special care and asked Incheon Airport for support. The man was put under the care of a security official at the airport on Dec. 18.

> ""We received a request from Singapore Airlines and agreed to allow the passenger to stay at a hotel within the transfer centre,"" said a spokesperson for Incheon Airport. ""We also kept an eye on him and did what we could, but at an airport where 200,000 people transit every day it is impossible for us to control any one passenger&apos;s movements.""

> On Dec. 19, the man was caught on CCTV cameras moving from the hotel toward the concourse. He jumped from the fourth floor down to the lobby on the third floor and was immediately moved to a nearby hospital. He remains in critical condition.

> Neither Singapore Airlines nor Incheon Airport said they have received an official notice from the man&apos;s family asking for compensation.

> Incheon Airport denies any liability, while Singapore Airlines told The Korea Herald that any official stance on responsibility is ""currently being discussed.""

The healthcare system (here and in most countries) is such that the burden is on the sufferer/loved ones who notice the sufferer's symptoms to step forward and get help. It can be hard to navigate the system if you're not familiar with it. PM me if you need advice on mental health resources in Singapore, including psych doctors/talk therapy.

To start with, [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/about-chat/mental-health-check/) offers free a mental health assessment by qualified psychiatrists. They will also write you a referral letter to IMH (which I don't recommend unless you are extremely cash strapped) or to a public hospital (SGH, if I recall). As for talk therapy, there is affordable counselling available at [Family Service Centres](https://www.msf.gov.sg/policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Pages/Family-Service-Centres.aspx) and I also find [Counselling and Care Centre](http://www.counsel.org.sg/) to be good. Also ask any psych docs/therapists that you consult with if they offer sliding scales to cater to your financial means.

There's always hope to prevent relapses or weather them better by seeking the appropriate help. Also, you're not a burden. I really hope you find professionals who suit your needs in Singapore. "

d79efev,damnmaster,"EMT for scdf here, just giving my two cents. 

This is a pretty fucked up case we got and to those who knew the girl, sorry for bringing this up, personally I really need someone to tell this to because it's really getting to me inside.

A few months ago we received a call, the call text already told us that someone had 'fallen' from 4 stories and the police were already dispatched. Female. 

As usual we got our shit and headed out. 6 mins later we arrived at scene, the police gestured to us from our ambulance to the scene but we already knew where it was, the screaming and crying was there. It didn't take long to see the body, a small girl face down, in the arms of who I suppose was her boyfriend. 1 metre away, her family, crying and wailing at her to wake up. We quickly shoo the boy away and the police attempted to get the family to move back and give us space. No can do, the bundle of tears in the corner refused to budge, crying and comforting each other as their daughter slowly slipped into the afterlife. 

We did our job, in and out, once in a while we hopped over strewn legs as the police attempted over and over again with increasing volume to get an understanding of what the fuck happened as well as move the family away from the body so we could do our job. Every once in a while, I would glimpse neighbours, even a couple of kids walking by and quickly running away, I don't blame them, her arms were like an octopus, doing CPR felt like I was squishing a block of meat. There wasn't any bones between her heart and every push spewed a bit of blood from her mouth. Then, a stroke of luck, CPR worked, she came back, her pulse returned, strong, even my paramedic was surprised, her face was badly damaged as she landed face first and she had lost a lot of blood.

Eventually we managed to load her into the ambulance and send her to the nearest hospital. My paramedic did carried on her work while I radioed ahead to warn them. (The nearest hospital did not have a trauma specialist and had to call one down from NUH) I check the IC to radio the information. Fuck she was only 14 years of age. I radio it in and carry on helping her breathe (She wasn't breathing) At the same time I used a suction machine to clear her nose and mouth. It was terrible, I could see her teeth moving around in a soup of her own blood and mucus, every time I put that tube in her nose it only brought back more blood. Suck and O2, suck and O2, I did that for the time it took for us to end up at the hospital. At the end I had a jar of body fluids to show for my work. I abandoned the suction machine and pulled her out before handing her over to the hospital. As luck would have it, the Trauma Specialist was already there, a previous case my friend brought in, amputation. 

We left feeling happy as fuck, my paramedic bought us a drink for a job well done. her pulse was stable and now it was up to the hospital to finish the rest. 

2 hours later after a few more calls we were resting in the station talking about the case. My paramedic told me that she had run out of the house after an argument. And that holding in her hand was a picture of the boy we assume is her boyfriend when she jumped. I shook my head and thought to myself *what an idiot, hopefully she understands this when she wakes up* And went back to relaxing on the couch. 

30 mins later my Ambulance driver comes into the room and informs us that the hospital called, she had died later on after we had left her. My heart sank, on the outside we joked as we usually do about our patients (It's a good coping mechanism to not take these cases seriously) But inside I felt like shit. All that optimism for nothing. A life lost because of such a stupid reason. I didn't know what I expected to happen but a small part of me hoped she had lived through this. 

I went home later that day, remembering a friend who had killed himself a year or so ago, I suddenly remembered every suicide, every dead person I ever went to, a moment sometimes with clues as to why and how they died. And that did it for me. I didn't want to see any dead people for a long time.

But life (or death in this case) carries on, going back to work, luckily the next few shifts spared me of any really gruesome cases and after a while I got over it. There are times I do sometimes picture her face, broken and bloody in my mind, or remember what my friend was like before he took his own life, or the man who thanked us for trying to save his wife as she died in front of him(And us) even though I know for sure she was gone. I remember them and they stay with me through the rest of my NS experience. 

I try to justify some of the cases, I tell myself that older people have lived a long life, they deserve to choose. But children? Teens? Fuck what have they truly experienced? A first kiss? Travelling to a distant land? Finally being independent? I could and can never justify it in my mind. And I don't.

Suicides are more prevalent than you expect, the ones the firefighters and police manage to pull back into the room are the ones I love the most because they are given a second chance. Yet at the same time I feel a sense of resentment and anger, why was no one there to pull that girl away? Why does this person get a second chance but not the younger ones?

"
d79bph9,Akajune,"I find it highly disturbing that the most upvoted comments revolve around 'talking' yourself out of a depressive episode; that somehow, you can 'look on the bright side'.

This is categorically dangerous and should not form the basis of any mental health advice whatsoever. 

What's more puzzling is sudden introspection about the stressful and unforgiving nature of Singapore society. A pointless and frankly non-sequitur line though of thought.

If we want to put a dent in the number of youth suicides, it shouldn't revolve around 'looking at the bright side' or complaining about how stressful our modern lives are. THey detract from proven, evidence-based population medicine.

Encouraging and educating our youth on ways to find professional help should be the priority. Strengthening our public mental health infrastructure should be a priority. Not fucking waxing lyrical about life being a goddamn RPG for fuck's sake."
d79ugr0,Hope83,"From the replies I see here, there is a terrible misunderstanding on suicidal thoughts and why people commit suicide. This to me is very harmful to aiding suicidal people. 

I have been suicidal before and I have had to be the listening ear and having to ""save"" others from commiting the ending life part. And just in the last few weeks I still have to be there for a suicidal teen.

Suicide is when the emotional and mental pain has exceeded the ability of the individual to cope.

Wtf is the whole rpg analogy about. If you are genuinely suicidal you won't want to do shit. You are feeling so much pain inside that all you want is to end that pain in the quickest way possible. You won't give a shit about doing anything because nothing matters anymore, everything is plain hopeless.

Suicidal thoughts is not a problem to be fixed which seemingly invites the ridiculous notion of giving suggestions of cheering up or u should do this or that and things would be better. 

If you see or know anyone whos suicidal, hear them. Feel what they feel and make their pain feel heard. Your job as a love one or a friend is not to fix them as if they are a problem. Your job is to be there for them, to make them realise that even if you don't understand the pain they are going through, you will walk through it with them even if they sound like a broken record everyday. It's your presence and empathy that matters, not your idiotic analogies/solutions/suggestions which is simply a result of people feeling helpless and not knowing how to help their friend and thus seemingly must say some useless shit to hopefully get their friend out of a rut. 

To those who are suicidal and happen to be reading this, I know how painful it is. I know how hopeless life seems and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel and nothing seems to matter anymore. The darkness and the pain which seemingly nobody understands. You are tired and even more tired of people telling u u should do this or that or to think about what will happen to your family and friends if you were to end your life, the guilt tripping only pains you even more. I cannot tell you that the pain is going to go away anytime soon or that things are going to get better soon. But pls don't give up. Find someone if you are able to whom really can hear u out, someone who really understands. Reach out. Tell them what it is you really need from them, for them to just listen without giving advices. Hang in there, you aren't alone in this journey."

d791uhk,llosa,"As someone who used to be suicidal, if there's anyone out there who wants to kill themselves, well, don't do it. Here's why. 

People always talk about how your death will impact your family and friends...and most suicidal people don't care. They just want it to end. Or people say how life gets better, but if you're already depressed, you don't think so. Or sometimes you're stuck in this problem that simply cannot be stopped - so it seems right to die now before everything falls apart. For example sometimes it feels like you're definitely going to fail your exams, so why bother torturing yourself? Or perhaps everything has already gone to shit, you've already screwed up, bankrupt, your SO left, you're sick, and there's nothing left to do. 

Well fortunately there is something left to do. Think of life as an RPG. You only get one go, so even though you've failed your objectives, there is still something to explore in the world. Have you ever wanted to lie in bed and watch TV for a week? Do that; if you have nothing to lose, then it won't hurt you. Have you ever wanted to write a book? No harm trying; after all, you might as well give it one try before you decide to die. Or if you don't feel like doing anything, which is the case for most suicidal people, then don't. After all, if you are about to die, then you deserve to be happy for a day at least. 

Do all the things you can think of that you want to do - or not do - before you die. And perhaps you will spend years doing these things. Perhaps you will find something you really like, and you can decide you want to postpone this dying thing. Maybe you actually want to live. But no pressure. Just do one thing at a time, except dying, because you have to 'get your money's worth' out of this one game. You don't need to be *happy*, you just need to be a little less unhappy.

These stress-related suicides never usually happen to kids from Neighbourhood secondary schools and JCs. But ironically they all sit for the same national exams. During my A level year, there was a girl who committed suicide after results day. She was from NJC or VJC, can't recall. Funny thing is, she actually did pretty well. She probably did better than half of my entire JC and she did better than me. I find that people who are consistently from top-tier schools are quite bad at accepting failure. Now in Uni it's about the same. I have coursemates from top-tier JCs who can't really accept it when they find out someone from a lower-tier JC is on the dean's list while they are not.

The way he describes his attempt sounds so beautiful; it kinda makes me at peace.

> On the third day, I left the villa and went outside to kill myself. The sun was beating hard. The air smelt of pine and the sea.

> The sea was right there, just below the cliff - no more than 20 steps away. And the only plan I had was to take 21 steps in that direction.

> In front of me was the most glorious view I’d ever seen. A sparkling Mediterranean, looking like a turquoise tablecloth scattered with tiny diamonds, fringed by limestone cliffs.

> Yet that couldn’t stop me wanting to kill myself. I simply couldn’t feel like this a second longer. I had to end myself - and I was going to do it while my girlfriend was in the villa, oblivious.

> Counting my steps, I walked. Then I lost count, my mind all over the place. ‘Don’t chicken out,’ I told myself.

> I made it to the edge. I could stop feeling this way by taking another step. It was so preposterously easy - a single step versus the pain of being alive.

> If you’ve ever believed depressives want to be happy, you’re wrong. They couldn’t care less about the luxury of happiness. They just want to feel an absence of pain. To escape a mind on fire, where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson.

> To be normal. Or, as normal is impossible, to be empty. And the only way I could be empty was to stop living. I stood there for a while. Summoning the courage to die, then summoning the courage to live. To be. Not to be.

I don't know. I think i am doing kinda well in life though, earning more than mean and median salary.

There's no point in getting number one or going into a premium school if it cannot get you earn more money in the future. I have seen some ex-ITE students in society earning 5 figure amount monthly due their ability to sell things (Real Estate, Insurance, contracts, etc).

So in some way, all the stress from the parents are actually not for the kids' future but rather to satisfy the parents' 'vanity'."

d79u5nj,kronograf,"Because they *chose* to end it.

For the most part, the sort of depression that drives people to threaten or commit suicide is a luxury that us in the developed world can afford to have. Look at the shit we choose to ruin our lives obsessing over - relationships, self-worth, dead-end jobs - and then look at what plagues the millions of less well-off people out there. Starvation, disease and disasters that wipe out your home, family and way of life. Endemic war and conflict. Mines in the ground and bombs from the sky. Countless people slog through all that just to keep the ones they love alive, to survive, to even attempt to find meaning in the madness of it all. 

And in our air-conditioned palaces, we're going to decide to end it all because our girlfriend/boyfriend left us, we got a D7 instead of an A2, or the daily hustle isn't paying us enough? To splat ourselves on the pavement and betray the opportunities we've been given and the sheer amount of labor from others that went into raising us as a thinking human being? Christ, aren't we narcissistic.

I've been where you come from. I've scraped enough bodies off the floor to be inured to it all. But you know who I *do* feel for? The ones that die through no fault of their own - the unglamorous, old men and women that shoved their selfish wants aside to raise families and sacrifice their living lives for others. The people who bleed out on the expressway in the haze of the morning commute. The mangled remnants of workers that came to an alien land to break their backs for their loved ones back home. The ones that pass away unappreciated yet unbroken.

The oft privileged, born-into-comfort teenagers that chose to throw away their lives - and wilfully tear apart the lives of those that survive them? I'm sorry. Barely a single fucking tear. "
d79e6om,Royallyscrew-ed,"I completely disagree with this. What works is a wholesome and holistic approach: address everything.

Society plays a huge part in such things. Encouraging and educating youth on ways to find professional help is one way, an extremely important way, sure. But medication is not the be all and end all for addressing this. 

An equally important issue is why this is even happening. Professional help addresses the ""after""/""during"" bit. There's a reason why countries like Japan have such high suicide rates amongst the school-aged population. Professional help is only one part of it. Schools should be involved, parents should be involved, society should be involved. Kids should be taught skills on how to express and regulate their emotions, they should be taught stress reduction techniques. You can't just throw everything at mental health professionals. Everyone plays a part.  "
d79qv23,drmchsr0,"There's very little point in making a world-class mental health infrastructure when you're releasing the patient into the environment that caused the issue in the first place.

This is not to diss the need for a world-class mental health infrastructure, since I'm actually one of the pepole who need it. However, there is a cause, and it SHOULD be addressed whenever suicides come up.

(It's unsurprising that other high-stress societies like Japan also suffer from similar issues.)"

especially because there is no proven mechanism of how SSRIs or whatever other drug ""cures"" depression and we don't even know that it is SPECIFICALLY AND CAUSATIVELY related to a deficit in dopamine / serotonin levels.

Keeping someone alive knowing they are totured by their very existence should really be a crime. But alas, its always ""you are not of sound mind to make your own decisions"". Anyone sucidal is given the same label, we're told that we aren't of sound mind, to even choose what we want to do with ourselves. Why isn't there such a thing as ""putting someone out of their misery"". Everyone thinks that by saving a life they are doing the most heroic thing. But is it worth it if you've just dragged the person back into what is essentially hell for them?

Even though I don't have sucidal thoughts now, I still loathe every moment that I am alive. In fact, the whole past experience has only taught me to hate. To hate myself, to hate humans. I still suffer from OCD, despite having had 7 years of treatment and I know it'll never get better (partially because I don't want it to). To have happy memories, we need bad memories. But to me, I'd rather be dead. And sometimes I wonder if I'm the only person who actually looks forward to death."

d79qfx6,fizzywinkstopkek,"I spent 3 years unemployed after graduating. I worked after turning 17(messed up Os) saved up and did my degree at 24 and finished it in the States. 4 years of that shit and came back to this. Graduated with all kinds of cheebye honors.  Tons of research and internship experience and got rejected  from even Starbucks. I could not find anything. All I wanted to do was to get a job, save up and do my PhD in Clinical Psy. but I was stupid and came back here while many of uni mates went to Harvard, Oxford or got excellent jobs straight after graduating( just to show that the Uni I went was not bad or not recognized).

I finally got a job though, nothing much. Just a lowly RA in another field. Back to square one. At the age of 32. I feel utterly worthless. Comparison is the thief of joy but you can't help it sometimes.  You will look  at everyone else. You try to be humble and learn something from them but you continuously fuck up and this is the worst part of it, you have no idea why you are fucking up.

Not everyone is going to win(whatever way you want to define that) in this life and in the grand scheme of things, my problems are insignificant. I have no idea how I have not killed myself yet, so at least I have that going for me.

d7976fc,Royallyscrew-ed,"This is great, but just to share a somewhat different view: 

I'm of the opinion that suicide is everyone's natural right: if you want to commit suicide, that is a choice. I don't see anything wrong with it. It's sad, sure, but it's a perfectly reasonable response to pain/illness or whatever it is might make one suicidal. By placing so much judgement/fear/negativity on the word ""suicide"" itself, not only do we (as a society) alienate those who are afflicted with such thoughts, we also unwittingly push them towards that very act. 

It's a choice. Having a choice empowers people. 

If you want to kill yourself, you can. You're not the center of the universe. Thousands die every day. You could die tomorrow in a road accident anyway. Nobody can predict these things. It's truly not a big deal. Think about it. Sure, your family will be heartbroken and many others will be hurt too. But in a few decades, you'll be forgotten and there will be no proof of your existence anyway. This is true for most of us, even those who are not suicidal. 

However, I hope you won't. Why? Because what the hell, you might as well live for a while more. You can kill yourself whenever you want. So try life for a while. You have nothing to lose. There's no pressure. Life is a joke. Or a game. Or whatever you want it to be. Nothing really matters. Stressed about your grades? In the grand scheme of things, none of these things matter. Don't catastrophize. It doesn't matter, none of it does.

d7a0foj,doctorwhybother98,"Heard this line of argument many times. 

You don't have a single idea about how mental illness works. I have a father suffering from depression exacerbated by heart illness and a sister who used to have OCD and who attempted suicide multiple times and I fear I may be suffering from depression too, albeit undiagnosed. I've sat in with my sister when she was undergoing therapy and I heard the therapist say something along the lines of: There is no such thing as greater pain, or more valid pain. Only your pain and my pain. 
This kind of macho tough man language helps no one and you know it."
d79wa54,tehpenggao,"I get where you're coming from. And I agree to a certain extent, it's first world problems. 

But I don't really think it's that simple. It's not that simple of ""oh, I got D7, guess I'll go jump now"". It can be years of build up, that isn't necessarily about the grade/gf/bf anymore. It's the anxiety, the fear, the brainwashing and belief that you are worthless. And it creeps up and adds on to you over time that you don't realise it's happening. Until one day you realise youre living with a constant physical aching heart, every breath feels like a chore. Dramatic, I know. But that's what this mental illness feels like. Even the anxiety attacks can happen ANY time. Watching TV? BOOM. can't breathe. 

They end it because they can't take this living hell anymore. And I agree that positive thinking and helping others helps to recover. That's what helped me to recover. But it took time. A LONG time. Like 5 years? 

I believe we can encourage people to be more positive, seek help and slowly take control of their lives. But we shouldn't dismiss the severity of mental illness, even if you think the reasons sound stupid. "

Depression isn't some sort of self esteem issue you shit talk to boost. It a fucking serious medical condition that isn't something you self remedy at home. You think the suicider commits suicide because they want to? They have an issue with their brain due to the lack of seretonin. They don't get depressed because they want to but they simply cannot control it. Insensitive macho talk like yours isn't going to help them."
d7aauov,drmchsr0,"You know who else gives negafucks about mental health? The PAP.

I'm also pretty suree Lee Kuan Yew had similar thoughts, as does most of the PAP. And guess who moulded the society that created the perfect catalyst for these ""meaningless suicides.

Or perhaps it's better, in your opinion, for people to lead meaningless lives at the brink of suicide with no help until they finally snap and try to suicide by cop, only to have a criminal record and thus have zero chance of getting help because of said criminal record. That's something I seriously considered too."
d79s190,fizzywinkstopkek,"The problem is our society breeds behavior like this and it is not going away anytime soon. I mean fuck, I work in one of the research departments(there are many) for MOE and everybody knows how teachers are utterly swamped with way too much work. You want to know the immediate comments from the fine scholars and individuals here after an interview or a focus group discussion? 

""Why they complain so much?""
""Don't they know they have it good?""
""Teachers these days are very lazy.""

A couple of teachers going into IMH a month, quitting from burn out or some teen killing themselves is a drop in a bucket to these people. People are VERY replaceable. I am not disagreeing with you. A holistic approach is THE fundamental aspect to treating many mental health issues. Unfortunately we are nowhere close to that and won't be if we continue the way we do things in Singapore.

We have always lauded ourselves as being a pragmatic society(and I am not denying that in many ways it works) but like all things in life, there is a price to pay. There is no free lunch.

d79xgju,kohtinneo,"I believe the two of you are not talking about the same thing here. Akajune is probably talking about people who are people who have MDD - which is considered a mental illness, which can be caused by a array of factors that 'patients' have completely no control over. 
Which is why they have to be on medication - and councilling for these patients often is to get them to take their medication.
It's like trying to talk/encourage someone out of a fever. It does not work like that."
d79kuhw,jinhong91,And yet I agree to parts of both sides.

d7a70tp,Hope83,"Terminal illness.. I don't wish to make sweeping statements without knowing the full situation, but I would like to think that I will still hope to save them. 

Even if someone is going to eventually die, every minute more that they can spend with their love ones ought to be cherished, and more importantly, to leave just like that by ending one's life, I know how painful it will be for the family members. I have seen the way my ex-classmate's mum cried so many years ago after her son (my ex-classmate) committed suicide and I won't want it to happen to anyone else if it's within my control.

As I mentioned in my own earlier reply, I dislike how people guilt trip others and I certainly am not trying to do that here now. But if I could forestall the person's ending of life so that the love ones get to have more time with the person, then that's good enough for me.

d79nbyg,heronumberwon,I've started working out... helps a lot too!!
d7b4qfi,hamstertoes,"Have been depressed and experienced suicidal thoughts at some points in my life. The longest lasted a year and half. Came close to doing it twice, about ten years apart. I have no moral or religious injunction against suicide, so staying alive is really a matter of weighing the pros and cons and a judicious application of strategies that worked for me. 

When it comes to that, those of us who have faced *the* question and yet are still here must have applied one or several methods to stay alive.  /u/llosa described some that worked for her. One of the methods I employed was similar; I see it as a kind of a last meal for a condemned prisoner. Except that hidden in the meal (perhaps in a fortune cookie?) is the possibility of receiving a slip of paper with a pardon. Anyway, mental gymnastics. It doesn't have to make perfect sense. I guess something in me was not ready to give up yet. 

I'd think, if I'm ready to give up everything, why not just take out all of my savings and do whatever I want with it? Travel to the Netherlands, perhaps. Or Mexico. Easier to get stuff that might or might not help (heh). Perhaps go somewhere else and do extreme sports, which I'd never got the guts to do. After all, there is nothing to lose. 

But in the end, I never got to do any of those. Just staying put and planning my next move occupied me enough that the acute sense of wanting to die *right now* just passed. Then it's back to the daily grind. 

At other times, I was just bargaining with myself. I'll wait until tomorrow morning. I'll wait another 24 hours. I'll have a swim, or treat myself to a nice meal, and see how I feel. I utilised my natural sense of curiosity: if I give up now, I won't know what's just 'round the corner. 

Sometimes I pretended I was a beast of burden, with no human perception of suffering, just going about my daily activities because I had to. 

It worked, small battles won, but the war was far from over. I was just living one day at a time, pretending to be normal. I took up music lessons so that at least once a week there was a human being who's expecting me. No one around me, family, friends, colleagues, suspected a thing. 

The depression petered off very gradually that I can't even be sure when it was over. I'm guessing it took between two to three years before I have safely returned to a healthy, resilient state of mind, and I wasn't the same person anymore. I changed jobs in between. I went for therapy. I changed the way I relate to my family and other people in my life. I learned about setting healthy boundaries and realistic expectations. I learned the internal workings of my own mind and learned to accept what I cannot change (still an ongoing process). 

It's been said before, but no two journeys are alike. For people who are in the thick of it, I wish you strength and perseverance. Get help whenever you see the need to. Keep going."
d793ann,llosa,"I personally don't think a suicidal person's priority should be to investigate and fix society; it's a herculean task which requires a lot of resilience and mental space to work through. 

Also, I don't say that suicidal people should pursue happiness, emotional numbness be damned. I just think that suicidal people and not-suicidal people are generally very similar. Everyone's just filling up the space between their birth and death. Suicidal people just need some help finding out how to fill the space in a pleasurable and sustainable way.

Nobody can help you feel better unless you want to, and hardly anybody has the time or sheer effort it takes to pull someone out of the morass of depression because they have their *own* problems to resolve, and difficult lives to live.

d79tjp3,Hope83,Well said. We are paying the price for ruthless pragmatism.
d7a7jkz,Royallyscrew-ed,"Akajune means well, I get that. I've been depressed for years and years, and every time someone tells me stuff like ""get over it"", ""try to be happy"", or even ""look at starving kids in Africa"", I feel like kicking them -- and I can't tell you how many times I've had people tell me such stuff. It shows a lack of understanding of what depression actually is. 

Depression is a real illness and just like any other illness, it requires professional help. Some get better on their own, some can get better with just therapy, but many others will need both medication and therapy. 

You mentioned that that patients have no control over the factors that cause MDD. There are many causes of depression, and while you are not responsible for your illness, you are responsible for doing something about it (and also the responsibility of your loved ones to help you with it). The reason why I am emphasizing this is because many people fall into 2 categories: either they're pro-medication and believe that depressives are just victims of their illness, or they believe that we are taking the easy way out by taking medication and that we just need to toughen up. 

There are many things you can do to help yourself when you are depressed. But sometimes it can *feel* impossible to do these things and that's where medication comes in. In most cases, medication won't magically cure you, but it will get you to a place where you'll feel better equipped to help yourself (and that's what therapy focuses on). 

Read the top comment by llosa. If you have ever been suicidal, you would realize that it's written with the utmost compassion by someone who has been there. Granted it may not suitable advice for everyone since everyone is different and therefore deals with situations differently, but her advice would resonate with many people who have been there. Her approach is not one of, ""think yourself out of depression"", as Akajune seems to have taken it. A lot of the stuff that she speaks about are actually real therapy techniques (with different names of course). 

Shifting your perspective (through different techniques) is a huge component of therapy. There are all sorts of therapies. Simply because llosa has not stated the specific technique doesn't mean she is talking nonsense. 

If you are ill and have yet to seek help, then definitely seeking help should be your first approach. However, if you are already in treatment and still suicidal, chances are you have to find your own way and try to shift your perspective on your own, or find some other way to survive -- whatever works for you. MDD is not the only cause of suicides -- a lot of suicides, especially by young people, are purely impulsive. Of course there can be another underlying illness behind that impulsive behaviour. 

One more thing: people experience suicide ideation in *many* different ways. Some feel an enormous amount of pain and will actively pursue methods to kill themselves. Some will feel an extreme amount of fatigue and have a deep sense of ambivalence towards dying. Many will have both. Others will experience a lot of fear and anxiety and contemplate suicide in order to get rid of that anxiety. What works to keep you alive will depend largely on how you experience suicide thoughts. 

If you're talking just about MDD, yes, you cannot talk yourself out of depression because it's a real illness where your brain chemistry would actually have changed. However, you can stop the downward spiral by focusing on the positive in your life. It's not a one-time thing. Do it every day. Don't be a victim. Doing things like focusing on the positive in your life (actively focus because the depressed brain has a tendency to focus on the negative), exercising, and even smiling (that's why we have laughter therapy!), eating right, sleeping well (can't sleep well? Get medication. Exercise, exercise helps sleep. Get sunlight, sunlight helps with sleep also increases serotonin production which helps depression). It's all interrelated. All these things target the *same* chemicals that depressives lack. Hug someone, hugging releases oxytocin which supports the serotonin system. There are plenty of things you can do for yourself. Medication is just part of it. "
d7a8hm3,tikki_Masala,"Dont you think that attitude people have towards wanting to spend time with loved ones, even ones in severe suffering selfish? Im not offending you or anything... it just seems selfish to force someone to live while theyre clearly in physical pain. 

I agree with you, If a loved one had  terminal illness and wanted to commit suicide I would probably just want to spend one last day with them and then let them go peacefully. I find it better than forcing grandpa into a hospital and putting him on life support while hes dying of cancer.

Saying this because Ive seen a family member die of Huntingtons and it was suffering; he was pratically guilt tripped into staying alive as his next of kin fought over his possessions."

d79amix,andeservedhero,I remember this. You should elaborate more on the awesome trip haha
d79det3,Royallyscrew-ed,"I completely agree. And that's why perspective is so important especially for people who are depressed. The other thing is gratitude. Gratitude is one of the best antidotes to negativity. When we are depressed, our brains become strongly biased towards the negative stuff and that's why it's sometimes very hard to have a clear, rational perspective of life. Practicing gratitude increases the serotonin production and increases activity in the dopamine circuits of our brains -- both of which are also targetted by antidepressants. 

At my worst, when I was in the midst of one of the worst suicide episodes of my life, the only thing that got me through was gratitude and perspective. I would do exactly what you said, I would look at the sky and remind myself of how insignificant and small we really are. Depression can make you feel completely alone even when you're in a room full of people. I often felt like the loneliest person in the world, completely emotionally disconnected from everyone. At such times, I would look outside and see the trees swaying in the breeze and I would find a deep sense of connection there. There's life all around us even when you feel alone or depressed.

I'd go so far as to hypothesize that it's the same in the countries I mentioned.

And I take it as a given that humanity is irrational to a fault, and that's with all their head bits in place and non-suicidal.

If I have a love one who's really in so much pain and wishes to leave this world, I will not stop them as long as I have been given the chance to spend the time with them. But that doesn't mean others will share my view. 

As for wanting to spend time with love ones even if they are in severe suffering a selfish view, I think this is an interesting question. 

I would say it IS selfish and it ISN'T selfish. The ""selfishness"" makes absolute sense to me. They love the person, they can't bear to see them leave. They are the ones who will have to bear with guilt too for the rest of their lives. They want to cling onto hope that somehow there might be a miracle. Acceptance doesn't come easily. 

The reverse can be true too. Is it not selfish too to want to leave this world because you are in pain and it doesn't matter how your love ones would feel? In the case you brought up it's physical pain. But for the typical suicidal person it's often due to emotional or mental pain, but it is pain nonetheless. 

In short, this is a gray area and there is no right or wrong, only tragic no matter what stance is taken. "

d7ua216,abrahame001,"Fine. I can see why you may think that way but let me counter your counter points.

1. The law doesn't and shouldn't follow society's general consensus. Society should follow the law not the other way round.
2. You're lumping all the people who attempt suicide into one monolithic group of people. There's a spectrum - some people are more desperate than others - and the more desperate ones will be that much more determined to do it well. They will at least do their research and nothing good comes out of knowing exactly how to kill yourself.
3. Knowing the existence of hotlines or the numbers you have to call isn't the same as feeling comfortable to reach out for help. Knowing there are resources and knowing that it's okay to seek them are two very different things.

You use a lot of vague general 'common sense' points of knowledge but I speak from experience. It does matter if it's illegal because it sets the tone for the rest of society and how they view suicide, and those who resort to it. 

You're right about one thing though. The main point isn't and shouldn't be about the legality of suicide - it should be about how society can be better prepared and equipped to prevent people from having to resort to suicide."

>Don't want to be forcibly committed, so let people with suicidal tendency roam free? What do you want the police to do then?

Yes, instead of letting them kill themselves, we just commit them to a ward where they lie in bed all day long until the medications work. If they don't, I hope they enjoy an extended stay in IMH or learn to lie about their condition.

This is the reality for anyone who's suicidal in Singapore, just fyi.

>don't complicate the issue by dragging obscure law that never gets enforced in

Like 377A, what is the point of the law if it never gets enforced?

>Since Singapore is subpar, then do share what the 'for par' standard should be.

The standard should be to have facilities that actually provide rehabilitation to patients beyond medicine or once a week therapy. Having visited a friend in a B2 ward, the only things he was allowed to do was roam around a small ward all day. There were minimal activities or amenities that would have made it conducive for recovery.

If we're supposed to have a first class health system, it certainly doesn't apply to the field of mental health.

Alternatively, it's perhaps time people acknowledge the reality that, like every disease, not everyone can be cured. It would be nice to have a national conversation about euthanasia, but I doubt our country is remotely mature enough for one. Heck, we still criminalize same-sex activities."

dhef6hw,eugenetjw,"I honestly can relate, after my Wife delivered our first Son, she didn't had enough breastmilk for him and this kid was damn greedy, she was sad but it was ok, what made me mad was some stupid Facebook group and WhatsApp group she joined, retarded bimbos in there insisted that she as doing harm to our Son by feeding him breast milk and that she MUST breastfeed. I noticed she was getting slightly depressed and after trying to find out but by bit I realised the root of the issue and simply took her phone, fuck all the retards in the group chats and left, afterwards it's more clearing some leave and staying with her to ""sell"" her the idea formula is fine too.

On a side note, I have a Friend who is an E cup with no breastmilk and the in laws always commented ""這麼大粒，沒奶？"" in Hokkien and Chinese.... it means ""so big breast, no milk?"" 

All in all, at least in my opinion.... having kids means both couples need to commit and not expect the mum to solely handle everything which is the case in some families that I see. Breastmilk or who takes care don't matter, if you face an issue try to talk and look for a solution together, the key is to raise the kids in a happy environment while ensuring we give and guide them, what others say don't matter since every kid is unique and there is no ""one size fits all"" method for anything. 

I was deeply sadden when I saw the news, instead of turning to government I think families members should play a deeper role."

I know this is a tragic case but saying no place to turn to is a bald-faced lie. Just googling the word ""suicide"" shows Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) 24 hour hotline and NCSS list of helplines including IMH 24 hr hotline, Breastfeeding Mother's Support Group Counselling Helpline etc. 

Mental healthcare IS available to the public. There are 24hr hotlines. As cold as it sounds, the system works when people seek it out. It cannot auto-detect people in distress. "
dhckul1,helzinki,Probably the issue could be people like that woman are too overwhelmed to think about looking for help. She was probably too stressed out to take a step back and think clearly and look for help.
dhd6val,throwfarfarlor,"Personally, I would not get any support in Singapore that can be noted down and attached to my life. I've known friends that got taken to the hospital by the SCDF and forcefully kept there for admitting to suicide ideation- not even having plans, but just having thoughts and wanting help to handle it. They've missed school and work because of that, impacting their lives and having a stigma attached to them by both family and friends. And this was completely legal. FFS, we only wanted some help."

dhd0cef,chiotkk,"I guess I didn't mean it literally when I said no place to turn to. I was referring to the hesitation that many feel to seek treatment, fearing social stigma. And hotlines are merely the first line of mental healthcare. There's still a lack of awareness and further affordable mental healthcare options."
dhcj1at,MrDLTE3,"> That's like saying NSFs are treated 100% fairly because the SAF hotline exists

wat. Having someone to talk to and a listening ear might mean the world to someone with depression. 

That's what the hotlines are primarily for. I'm not saying the hotlines are perfect because the other side is human too. I'm addressing the comment that ""no place to turn to"". 

Speaking of the SAF hotline, if your superior is being a fuck ass, asking you to do unreasonable shit, call it and explain your situation. SAF might have a shitty reputation of having dumb policies but you can bet your ass they also want to siam problems.  

During my time there was a guy who took a fuck ton of MCs because of his skin condition like 2months/3months MC back to back type. It was obvious he needed the MCs because his skin was always in a disgusting condition, pale, flaking off with blood patches. Our CSM wanted to give him a hard time, to make an example out of him so he told him that he had to report every monday to camp to endorse his MCs. 

He called the hotline and the medical board cc-ed an email thread to HQ and all the nodes about SAF MC endorsement policies, basically telling the encek that he can't do shit to the guy with valid MC.

dhd42qa,syanda,"> wat. Having someone to talk to and a listening ear might mean the world to someone with depression.

It does, but from personal experience, the anonymous helplines and stuff in SG don't really help. There's almost no social support for this sort of thing, except through pretty impersonal contact - by phone, or over the internet. Getting some good, face-to-face help and intervention is pretty fucking hard here.
"
dhcpvx7,freedaemons,"Yeah, I think both of you are on the same track. He's saying that if you're contributing to the problem, it's not sufficient recompense to simply provide self-help aids. Dump oil into the ocean, ok, we'll sponsor some clean-up! How about you don't contribute to the corporate culture where it's normalized to pollute as a part of business. 

The parallel is that the overall culture contributing to these social problems in Singapore isn't fully the government's responsibility, but for a people who constantly reelect a nanny state, you have to admit that they have been given a lot of influence, and they use it too, as they see fit to ensure Singapore's economic and national viability.

NSFs would need to use the hotline a lot less if the regulars treated them like peers who are trying to serve the country just like them. That they don't isn't just on the individual, it's in part because of the overall organizational culture, i.e. the system."

> When his stepdaughter suggested selling the family home that year, Poh tried to kill himself and also tried to burn down their three-room flat in Jurong.
> 
> He was hospitalised for a month, and after being discharged, he discovered that he had been locked out of the flat.

> Poh was sent to Tembusu Home in Buangkok after that incident. For the next two years, he lived in the home.
> 
> On Nov 8 last year, a Tembusu Home employee accompanied Poh to a check-up at Hougang Polyclinic.

**EDIT:** I'm hijacking this comment to address /u/skipshentaiscene's comment, which I think is a useful jumping-off point for a good conversation about the utility of news media: 

> I read the article and didn't find anything flagrantly wrong with what he said tbh?

**27 kids killed themselves in 2015.** That's more than 1 coffin every fortnight. This is out of a total of 409, which is more than one every day. Now, that's 6.6% of suicides being from ages 10 to 20. (For context, 10-20yo's make up 11.4% of the resident population.)

The questions on everyone's minds are: **Why** are these kids killing themselves? **What** should we do about it? 

According to the article's representation of its quoted expert,

* recognize that suicide tends to occur because of several sources of stress (opening)
* don't be dismissive (good advice!)
* acknowledge and validate their children’s problems (good advice!)
* ""reiterate that while we seek to understand suicide, it remains a complex human behaviour that cannot fully be attributed to a single cause."" (closing)

Most people, when consuming any sort of media, will remember the opening and closing bits most strongly. They'll largely gloss over the good advice in the article (acknowledge and validate your children's problems), and their takeaway will be ""suicide is multi-faceted and we cannot blame a single factor"". This is unfortunate. 

Consider the context in which the news article is arising – a boy recently killed himself because of his grades, and people will want to know what the implications are for our cultural and social attitudes towards education. This was **not** addressed in the article – could be because the journalist is short on time, or maybe the editor wants to play it safe (to 'avoid anything flagrantly wrong').

**TL;DR:**

The article avoids saying anything wrong, but it also avoids tackling people's concerns and suspicions head on. This dilutes media quality. We know from experience that school is stressful. We know from experience that it gets COMPOUNDED by family and peer pressure (they aren't separate variables). The article doesn't adequately address this."

How are we letting this die down with a gentle slap on the wrists of the SPF?

He asked me about life in NS, chit chat a bit and then delved into the incident and I just told him my version of events.

The weird thing is that at the end of the interrogation, I didn't know whether he believed my version of the story or whether he thought I was guilty. It seemed purely fact-finding. So I'm kinda not surprised that the mother found out that the son confessed from the son and not the IO. I don't think the IO shares his analysis of the facts to the son or the mother.

It troubles me that your concern here is not for the welfare of the minor but for the police to have a easier time doing their job. What if the minor doesn't fully understand the gravity and consequences of the situation and says something that gets them into trouble because they are scared or believe that doing so will put a stop to it? You must realise that plenty of people are arrested, released on bail but subsequently have the charges dropped. Simply being arrested is not an automatic determination of guilt. Minors aren't even allowed to enter into legal contracts how can they be interviewed alone by the police?

Seeing as parents cannot be relied upon to be unbiased parties, I tend to agree with this. However, I think there still needs to be a neutral entity present, such as a councilor, to ensure that adolescent (or younger) suspects are not put under undue duress. "

When you place a minor, who's been taught his whole life that the police only come to get you when you've done something wrong, alone and unguided with the people he's taught to fear, bad things can (and did) happen."

Interesting, but how do you punish intent? You can only punish behaviour. Intent is almost non-observable. Even in cases of murder, pre-mediation is determined by observable evidence. Or ask yourself another question: does ignorance mean people are free to break the law? 

> So really, it depends on whether you value truth, or merely punishing somebody regardless of their intent.

Sorry to say this but to some extent, the law should be concerned with behaviour first and foremost in deciding punishments, then taken intent into consideration, perhaps at the appeal stage. If we are going to punish intent over behaviour, the law stops serving as an active deterrent to crime. "

And they had CCTV footage of the alleged molestation, and supposedly it was clear enough to identify the kid. Whether it's true, no one knows, and likely due to the nature of this case, no one will know.

>From what I know, CCTV is often grainy and unclear (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Short answer: Maybe

Long answer: It mostly depends on the type of camera you use and the system it saves the footage to. CCTVs have to record constantly without breaks and save the footages for weeks if not months. Try taking a 5 minute video with your phone, look at how much storage it takes, and multiply that by 12. That's just 1 hour worth of footage. If the system has terabytes of storage for each camera, you can assume it's 720p similar to the video on your phone. 

>I don't understand how our police became this secretive and close-minded

Because they aren't supposed to talk about open investigations and are supposed to keep information private until investigation concludes. It's the same for most judicial systems (albeit because most other countries have juries)"
czkjbbj,austinlsj,"There's only bits and pieces given to us about this case, too little information to draw an accurate conclusion of who really is to blame in this situation.

czko7wo,dashrandom,"> However, an accused with little or no legal knowledge has no way to protect himself from self incriminating himself.

No no, if a minor's testimony can be refuted as evidence in the court of law if proven to be made under duress (all the more reasons for police to keep recordings to prove no duress on their part) then the above is assumed and there is no need to protect the minor further.

> That's why parents should be allowed with their kids. Or at least a trusted lawyer, but never alone

czkr0wk,eciecieci,"I'm not a parent yet. But I can share with you what my mother told me when I was young. 

When I went to primary school, my mum told me something along the lines of ""You need to respect your teachers. Don't be rude to them. But if they touch you inappropriately or anything, you must tell mummy when you come back."" I believe the advice won't vary much for other families. Most of the time it is about giving teachers the respect they deserve but report any sexual/physical abuse. 

Similarly, while my mum also used the ""If you are naughty, I'll ask mata to come and catch you"" scare tactic, she also reminded me regularly that ""If the police ever question you, call mummy and don't be afraid. Do not ever admit to something you never do. You have nothing to be afraid if you did nothing wrong."" 

It is important for parents to realise that when their kids start going to school, they cannot be there to protect them 24/7 and hence the need to advise their kids appropriately. No doubt having 5 strangers bringing you to an unknown location can be stressful, but it should not traumatising enough to cause suicide. From what Khael8 shared, the SPF do try to make things less stressful on their end, is it too much to ask parents to do their part or is it still ""no way the fault of the parents""?

czndaen,dashrandom,"> Making a mistake while driving and running someone over, and intentionally running them over (road rage) are distinguished only by intent.

I'm not being obtuse. **Observable intent** is the point here. If you have an incident of road rage with someone, have no intent to run him over but accidentally got a cramp in your leg and floored the accelerator after having a shouting match with him and walking back to your car, good luck trying to prove your intent in court. 

Let's just say you discovered your girlfriend was cheating on you, send her angry messages, and get ready to drive over to confront her. As you are on the way to her place, someone dashes out on the road and you can't brake in time. The person you've killed is her lover. Girlfriend accuses you of murdering him and brings evidence to court in the form of angry messages. **Good luck proving you accidentally ran a random stranger over**. 

I'm not try to say you're 100% wrong. I'm just trying to say that we induce intent from behaviour in the court of law. "
czo6dx0,chernann,"The point is, there is often a lack of physical forensic evidence one way or other in this type of incident, which is why, as in the case of molesting a woman, the police and prosecution rely heavily on confessions.

So, interrogating an impressionable minor has the significant danger of creating a crime that does not exist, because intent was never there.  False confessions are common. While behavior is one way of deducing intent, it is not the only way.  It is the intent that matters - there is a fine line between reckless manslaughter and murder, and it's the job of the courts to draw it."

If you go around and see how people think about NS servicemen, there isn't really much respect. If they sleep on the MRT also kena stomp, work Grab part time also kena sabo.  Singapore completely lacks any prestige for servicemen. Let me tell you my US experience: I had travelled to the US and my dad bought a hat from some US army airplane museum. When he wore it and went around the hotel, there were a few people who would say ""thank you for your service!"". It was honestly eye opening for me. I wonder why it's so different over here.

Another issue is that they lose 2 years of their youth. If you look at South Korea's conscription, they do not force you to conscript at such an early age. If I remember correctly you just need to enlist before your 30s, if we modelled after them, these people would have also finished their pursued education or early career which banks quite a bit on youth. If you look at sports or even e-sports, once you pass a certain age you are done. The opportunity cost is really that huge.

Over there, we as NSF assist the regulars in arming the aircraft as well as paperwork. We go through the same routine everyday for approximately 1.5 years.

If we can pay millions of dollars to get the ""best"" ministers, why aren't we willing to pay for a motivated, professional army? Even if we concede that conscription is to an extent neccessary why does it have to be 2 years long and solely the duty of men? I'm no expert but I think 1 year or less of basic weapon and military training for every citizen is more than enough to give us a fighting chance against conventional attacks. 

To your point about manpower, why should young males solely bear the heavy burden of serving as low cost labour to fill the ranks of SCDF and police simply because the government doesn't want to pay people enought to consider it as a career?  If no one wants to be a nurse, for example,  it would be ridiculous to suggest conscripting all young women to serve for 2 years, rather than trying to make the profession more attractive through incentives.

Right now, many who sign on do so as the last few options, why can't the pay and benefits be good enough to push a uniformed job to be in consideration for most people as the top 3 options ? Also, the lack of manpower has always been because NSFs rotate out too quickly. They go through basic training, then they go through vocational training, before being rookies that enter their roles. By the time they are semi-decent, ORD LOH.

e54vdfh,lotcapp,"This argument sounds logical in theory, but ignores practical realities.

**The truth is, for all the benefits that NS gives us, Singapore is ultimately defenseless against any foreign enemies who are serious about invasion.** The Singaporean army size is insignificant compared to that of our neighbours, and it always will be, by virtue of our small population size. Despite our large pool of reservists, given the prominence of total warfare in the last century, countries like Indonesia will always be able to outnumber us assuming every last man is mobilized, simply because they outnumber us 40 to 1. **Even ignoring the numbers game here, Singapore is fundamentally hard to defend due to the fact that its small size lends it little [strategic depth.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_depth)** The North Vietnamese were able to conduct a successful guerilla campaign by withdrawing into the vast expanses of their dense jungles. In contrast, the land area of Singapore would be quickly overrun and easily occupied by any serious professional army of respectable size. The small size of Singapore limits our defensibility and prevents the mobilization of our large reservist pool in any significant number.

Regarding your point about the lack of manpower in civil service jobs such as firefighters etc., there is a very important distinction between the public and private sectors. That is, **the government has direct control over the wages of civil servants.** Simply adjust the salaries of firefighters and policemen and leave the rest to the market forces of supply and demand. The same can be applied to the Army should we decide to maintain a respectable size without conscription. 

Instead of relying on an army that looks decent on paper but ultimately does nothing to deter any potential aggressors, Singapore should look to other methods to safeguard our independence. The Swiss in particular have been able to protect their citizens and remain largely independent for much of the past 700 years through their establishment as the banking capital of the world. Weaving a complex and interconnected web of international finances around them has made it unprofitable for countries to directly attack them, and allowed them to maintain Swiss neutrality with a comparatively small army even while destructive European wars waged around them. **My point is, NS is not the only way for Singapore to ensure its independence.** Defense treaties and international agreements are not ""depending on other countries for protection"". The agreement goes both ways: there are other ways to project power beyond blunt military might."

Here's a few commonly-cited reasons for why NS isn't all that bad which could also be reasons why I think our girls wouldn't mind serving:

> Most SG men are at their fittest during these 2 years

This is the best chance for our girls to see eye candy **everyday** in their best state. Why see them only on weekends? Just come right in and feast your eyes **every single day**!

> It's just 2 years of service to the country and will be finished in a blink of an eye

Since it's just a short time and 'finishes in the blink of an eye', I'm sure our girls won't mind it.

> Volunteer Corps response has been positive from women

If 2 days is fun, why stop there? Just go ahead and enjoy yourself for 2 whole years?


One last point that doesn't fall into either category: 

> Due to shrinking population, our NS men numbers are also shrinking and there's not enough personnel to fill in the ranks.

We have quite a big pool of unused human resource to tap into. This also leads back to my first point, -1 liability +1 asset."
e555nl1,justonetempest,"Just wanted to weigh in and say that I think our biggest deterrence to an organised external force that has any affiliation to a country or whatever is that Singapore is a huge bastion of political and economic stability in the region. If Singapore falls, so does economic and political interest in the region. Sure, Malaysia and Indonesia have big industries and corporations, but Singapore underpins a lot of local headquarters for MNCs precisely due to its positionality in the global economy and politics. Beyond that, ASEAN is a rather important economic formation for a number of South East Asian countries, and again Singapore underpins that with its economic and political stability.

The biggest dangers to Singapore come from 1) organised terrorist forces and 2) despotic regimes. The first requires a military, along with a civil defence force. But this does not require a military the size that we do now. The second is the strongest argument we can have for having a large, broad-based military, although arguments can also be made for a more specialised, technologically superior and strategically advanced military which concentrates resources rather than dispersing them."
e564vd6,JAE2015,"OP, I’m sorry but you’re a self-righteous airhead"
e54xgce,littlefiredragon,"The long period of stability and peace has made a large  population of locals complacent about our state of security lol.

I could say that rising nationalist sentiments among our neighbours’ politicians have made them increasingly hostile to us, and point to their newspapers to show how daring they have gradually became and how much support they are gathering, but it would be wasted on deaf ears. But our intelligence agencies are doing a better job than I could, to ministers who are more receptive and wiser.

I could say that terrorists are additionally motivated to attack us to make a statement and prove their strength due to how renowned our defence is, and there is enough evidence that it is in the works to make our defence minister declare that the threat right now is at its highest since 2002, but we aren’t going to be convinced until it happens yeah?

There is no doubt on its importance. You wouldn’t think that one of the best governments so focused on productivity in a country with declining birth rates would still keep it if it was useless? Sure people would say it is an excuse for cheap labour, but it’s actually inefficient if you consider the budget. I see this as evidence of mistrust and disconnect between the ruling and the people instead, which is 1 big emerging issue we now face, which is a separate topic of discussion.

I agree with the OP that the issue is about flexibility, not the need."
e54wshh,jtcd,"> N.S isn't only about army too. We need to maintain a sufficient workforce for our civil services (police, firefighters etc)

The notion that NS is necessary to maintain our ""civil services"" is patently false. Consider this: Only 26+ countries have conscription, yet many countries manage to maintain their ""civil services"" just fine. Amongst the many countries that are doing just fine are numerous countries with similar population sizes, such as New Zealand, Ireland, Hong Kong and more.  

As for the military, I'm actually all for improving ours. I would support increasing our defense expenditure in the coming decades, because historically, the probability of global conflict has risen whenever the incumbent global power has waned. This has been true throughout human history, from the Roman empire to the British empire, till today - the US is losing ground to the Chinese, and is unlikely to graciously surrender their hegemony.  

That said, militaries around the world are moving toward a ""leaner but meaner"" approach - improving a modern military is about cutting numbers while embracing technology. Take China for instance, considering their prickly relationship with the US, they have every reason to take their military very seriously. Yet they have been cutting troop numbers: [Why China Is Trimming Its Army](https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/why-china-is-trimming-its-army/). The same can be said of the Russians: [Russian Military Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Russian_military_reform), and many others. Indeed, in this day and age, you will be hard pressed to find a modern military that is increasing its manpower.  

Why is this happening? Because modern technologies provide a massive edge over raw numbers. Recent conflicts like the Russian intervention in Ukraine clearly illustrate how ground troops are increasingly becoming nothing but cannon fodder for the latest technologies - why field a mediocre platoon of conscripts when an unmanned drone or precision targeted strike can cut them down at next to no cost? Consider the US elections too. Russia has done massive damage to the US and NATO using just a couple dozen trolls. Indeed, some believe that their trolling tech has done more for them than their million plus soldiers ever could. Wars are being won and lost in labs, and forward looking militaries are aware of this.

As our ex-military leaders have ventured into the public sphere, it has become evident that our generals tend to be status quo loving and somewhat inefficient. It thus comes as no surprise that the SAF has been late to embrace technology over numbers. If they manage to embrace tech, the SAF has a better chance than ever to thrive on a fully professional force. A common retort to a fully professional force is the notion that ""not enough people will sign on"". This notion does not take into account the fact that by saving on conscription expenses, pay for military personnel could be increased significantly. Moreover, the SAF will no longer be seen as an adversary of the people, and so soldiering could become respected in the same way that Singaporeans respect certain professions.

Edit: Grammar"
e558oe5,slaiyfer,Your comment about civil services is pure BS. Most other countries in the world can maintain their firestations n police stations with quick response times without conscription. You dont need anywhere near the size of an army for civil def forces to justify conscription. What have you been smoking? The ruling party's weiner?
e55ph5i,Jambelli,"Another Singaporean step one patriot. You got attend NS yourself or not?

Majority of the NSF have shit training standards. BMT go through field camp all the specialist will pass you through your tests without batting an eye unless you really fucking horrible.

Majority of NS training is learning how to respect your superiors rather than actual training that will aid you in combat.

I acknowledge some units got standards and really up there lah but if you think the majority of NS men who served are capable fighters then you got a screw loose lol.

The local press is also coy about offending our neighbours so most people are none the wiser. 

You speak to some and they think the reason we have NS is because our pop is too small to have a standing army which is not the reason for NS or conscription. There are many countries that have a very small army but they do not have NS. 

Our Armed forces are much bigger than NZ and OZ so why the difference . The inherent threat is much larger.

I agree with most comments about NS being 1 year but why should only the guys do NS? If you really want to maximize military capability, woman should also do NS. It's fair. Don't start using stupid arguments like woman is weaker so hence men should do NS.

Thanks to the intensity of NS, guys lose even more time before NS because they have to start working out and not feel like killing themselves during training while doing their studies/projects/homework?

e55aei2,bananandan,"TBF, the rationale for using conscription to form our army was due to our inability to afford a professional army.

Given how our economic status has changed, the assumptions can too. Regulars do still make up a significant portion of the force. Furthermore, technological advancements (automated weapon systems) and outsourcing to private businesses like ST Logistics have reduced the need for the number of personnel.

14% of our budget already goes towards defence which creates a significant opportunity to areas like healthcare, housing and education.

I'm not saying you can completely abolish it but obligations should be reduced where possible.

Or another example, instead of giving us a petty allowance of for example 560 for a recruit, they also give 2k to our cpf every month, sure the accounting part may not tele anymore but in the end it is all digital currency and to them it's just numbers so adding a few more zeros to our cpf digitally should be nothing to them, the last idea, remove taxation forbthise who have served ns, I mean 2/3 of our population already consists of many foreigners, ifbthey choose to become a Singapore citizen just to avoid tax then the government have to seriously consider the criteria to become a citizen, if not, as a citizen my self, it's a pretty good deal.

 I am sure if they bothered making more benefits than giving us more responsibilities *cough cough* liabilities.

however not everyone gets a chance to work in the government sector, most will go to the private sector, going for reservist is a liability to most companies, they would definitely pick a foreigner to keep up the efficiency in the company.

Given that I’m going to be earning $500 and working in shitty conditions, the least the government could do would be to increase the pay. At least the money will somewhat alleviate the shittiness of NS. 

And also, plenty of my female friends are already in uni while I’m working a shitty part-time job before doing an even worse 2 years. It feels like us guys are left behind. Can’t we be like South Korea and give more freedom regarding the timeframe to serve? 

Also, as a sports fan, it irks me given how NS prevents our sportsmen from achieving even better results. Son Heung Min (Tottenham player) from South Korea is playing at the Asian Games with the chance of being able to be exempted from NS. On the other hand, our sportsmen (especially footballers), are expected to have achieved top-level results prior to their NS enlistment age. Like seriously wtf, only a handful of players fulfil this criteria. If we are willing to allow a soil scientist to disrupt NS for 13 years, why can’t we grant an Olympic Gold medallist an exemption?

e54y4pe,M2g1x,"Also an AFT, was at AFS for 'theory' for about 2 months, then there was more 'practical' training at Tengah for another 2 months. By the time my batch of technicians were qualified to work independently, it was already about a year in. I do see that they need the manpower for the hectic operations. Maybe if more manpower can be allocated, then it will be possible to reduce the NS time.

However, the NSmen that went back really is a waste of time. The usual high key is 3 weeks with 1 week of training and 2 week of operational work. From what I see, the NSmen are mostly too detached from the aircraft work since they are not in a related field. So they are just there to buy breakfast for the crew. It is a waste of time for the NSmen. All the training of NSmen take time and resources. Especially in the air force, you need the currency to work on aircraft. Extra manpower is needed to keep the records and plan for each cycle so that they still have currency. Such resources can be used in a better way if there is no reservist."

But for other vocations, for example combat engineers and infantry, after their training period they'll have to go through plenty of missions in SG, Thailand where they have to go through various training and war exercise. Of course there are substantial lull period in between those missions where seemingly the NSFs do nothing. But doing nothing means resting. Can you imagine every training and mission being squeezed into 6 months? The injury/death rate will definitely shoot up substantially.

​

There will be a whole slew of problems to come when you force your entire young population to enlist. Their education gets delayed, they enter the workforce later and with less experience (competition being foreigners), they would need to be out of office for 1 month every year for reservist duties. I know guys are already subjected to this, but the impact would be significantly broadened if girls were to enlist too.

As a result of a late start to their career, women might choose to have kids later as well. Impacting our population growth rate further.

All of this only points to one natural conclusion, more foreigners being brought in to support the economy and population. We're gonna have to be prepared for that if we ever go down the female enlistment route.

We only have a Causeway, and you know very well how well that geographic defense worked in WW2. In fact the first objective in the event of war is actually to capture Linggui Reservoir. That's not in Singapore, by the way. 

Diplomacy has always been the front line of Singaporean defense, exactly because we **cannot** afford a war. The best we can do is to make waging war hurt enough for the invaders to reconsider.

And before anyone forgets, Singaporean soldiers have died during Konfrontasi, and Singaporean diplomats still have nightmares from Malaysia's military grandstanding during the 90s. There's no telling whether history would repeat itself, and we already know relying on other countries for our defense and security is ultimately a crap shoot (see: British Empire), so why go back and try something that we already know won't work? "
e553vu4,bonkers05,"> Even ignoring the numbers game here, Singapore is fundamentally hard to defend due to the fact that its small size lends it little strategic depth. The North Vietnamese were able to conduct a successful guerilla campaign by withdrawing into the vast expanses of their dense jungles. 

It is precisely because we have no depth at all that we need such a large orbat to create that depth. If we were the size of Johore, maybe we could get away with an army 2 or 3 brigades strong and this could conceivably be a 2/3rds professional, 1/3rd reserves army. 

But we are not and no manner of raising wages will enable us to raise a professional force of the size necessary. 

> In contrast, the land area of Singapore would be quickly overrun and easily occupied by any serious professional army of respectable size. The small size of Singapore limits our defensibility and prevents the mobilization of our large reservist pool in any significant number.

That's why, I presume because that is the reasonable thing to do, we would have intelligence people who would monitor the movements of forces nearby. And that we practice mobilisation like no one else does. And don't underestimate our small size because that allows us to concentrate forces like no one else can either. 

No one in their right mind would conceive independence for a nation as improbable and impractical as Singapore. But we have to do our best to play the hand we were dealt with and for the moment that unfortunately means conscription. 

I look forward to the day Malaysia is as prosperous and rational as Singapore, when we can rejoin our brothers and sisters and do away with NS. 

> Instead of relying on an army that looks decent on paper but ultimately does nothing to deter any potential aggressors, 

Looking good on paper I would say is the SAF's primary role. Deterrence *is* the number one mission. It is what allows us to go ""umhm"" and be taken seriously, and that is a public good enjoyed by all citizens and residents. "
e551iuf,thestoryteller69," You assume that our army is our ONLY form of deterrence. In reality, the army works with several other factors, including defence treaties and international agreements, as you have pointed out. Just because there are other factors that help preserve our independence, doesn't mean NS has NO PART to play on preserving our independence. 

You also assume we will ultimately lose any war, therefore we are defenceless. The two are not the same thing. NS is part of what makes invading us painful. So painful that, even if we were to be conquered, it wouldn't be worth it. It's like saying, if I really want to buy that sports car, I can. I can borrow money at a crushingly high interest rate and do it. But that doesn't mean I will, because the cost is still prohibitive. 

Singapore has never relied on its army alone to secure its independence. It has never even pretended to. But the army is an integral part of preserving its independence. As George Kennan said, ""You have no idea how much it contributes to the general politeness and pleasantness of diplomacy when you have a little quiet armed force in the background."" "
e54wvdf,oklos,">assuming every last man is mobilized

This is exactly one of the central justifications for NS in the first place, so this assumption is *not at all acceptable* in a debate over NS. With NS, Singapore's military manpower reserves are surprisingly not too far off from Malaysia and even Indonesia, because neither of our neighbours subject such a high proportion of their potential manpower to mandatory military training, and even if they were to mobilise much of that potential manpower, a large section of that would be significantly further behind in terms of operational readiness relative to even NSmen."
e54wr9z,CaptainChopsticks,"Taking a look at Wikipedia, our neighbour’s armed forces sizes are actually not superior to ours. 

Your point about the lack of strategic depth is true. 

However the reality about creating a professional armed force is simply that SG has not enough people to do that. Also, wouldn’t that incur more costs? Our government budget is barely balanced as it is. 

You raised Switzerland as an example, but doesn’t Switzerland have conscription too? "
e5587ii,thoughtihadanacct,"I replied to another person regarding China, but the same point is valid for Indonesia (or any other country). It is not valid to compare the full military size of the agressor against the defender, The aggressor must always keep some assests out of the fight to protect the homeland. In the case off Indonesia specifically, their armed forces plays a huge role in keeping the civil peace. Their navy in particular is needed to patrol the hundreds (thousands?) or islands and “manage” the population. They can’t afford to stop doing that and just send every ship and soldier to attack SG.

Regarding your point on Swiss neutrality and making themselves a useful and hence protected member of the global community, well SG is sort of doing that with the banking sector as well. We also are a significant base for US navy ships, and we do random useful stuff like hosting various summits and conferences similar to geneva. But because we got played out during ww2 I guess we just have trust issues and we can’t let go of our own defence (which I personally don’t think is a bad thing)."
e55ajj7,throwmefuckingaway,">The truth is, for all the benefits that NS gives us, Singapore is ultimately defenseless against any foreign enemies who are serious about invasion.

>Despite our large pool of reservists, given the prominence of total warfare in the last century, countries like Indonesia will always be able to outnumber us assuming every last man is mobilized, simply because they outnumber us 40 to 1.

Hardly true. There are actually very few countries that can invade Singapore aside from the super powers. You are only taking the army into account and you are completely discounting our geography, our air force and navy. We are an island nation and to invade us, you either have to go through Malaysia or attack from the sea. Attacking from the sea is complete suicide because the RSAF will stop anything coming from the sea. 

Our air force is insane for a country of our size. The only country that has a larger air force : population/GDP ratio is Israel. There is no air force in the neighboring SEA region capable of matching us. Even if all the SEA countries were to combine their air forces, they are still unable to match the RSAF.

After discounting the superpowers China, India and USA, the only big regional countries left in Asia are Japan, South Korea and Australia. Their air forces are on par with us in terms of technology but they are about twice as big as us. This is pretty impressive when you consider that Australia is 5.5 times larger, South Korea is 9 times larger, and Japan is 23 times larger in terms of population size.

However they are also a huge distance away from us, so they have to deal with the logistics of flying their aircraft over. None of these countries possess aircraft carriers and they will have to directly fly their planes over from their country. It is therefore logistically impossible for them to fly their entire fleet over to Singapore, giving us the numbers advantage as we can quickly land our planes, refill, re-arm, and have them flying in the air again.

So no, it is not true that we are defenseless against foreign enemies who are serious about invasion. Putting aside the super powers, there are almost no countries which are able to defeat our air force. We followed the Israeli doctrine of building an insane airforce and it definitely shows. If you notice, the RSAF uses many of the same planes as the Israeli Air Force.

Damn I just got an RSAF boner typing that."
e54xbww,BulletMAntis,"I'm surprised so many people aren't mentioning this. NS cannot be considered as Singapore's defence nor deterrent force because the truth is, our army is really insignificant compared to those of other countries. Numbers, professionality, we pale in both. Any country that wants to wage war against us can overpower our army.   
  
Also, in case anyone doesn't know, when it comes to war, Singapore will never be on the defensive side.   
  
We need to be looking into other forms of deterence to safeguard ourselves. Be it forming close relations with other powers or progressing to a point where we are important and impactful to the rest of the world.  
  
Our current NS system is so outdated, it simply cannot catch up to anything or anyone (also rather bs when it comes to certain aspects). I'm not saying it should be abolished, but it is time for a system overhaul, to make NS relevant if we want it to mean something. We should stop forcing NS to be this theorectically impressive defence force on the frontlines, but shape it as a compliment to a more well-rounded defence system."

e558za9,scaryterry65,"You neglect to mention that the Swiss has always been warriors. They won their independence with blood from the Habsburgs and Swiss mercenaries were dominated the European battlefield for centuries; Switzerland maintained its independence in then tumultuous Middle Ages because everyone were using Swiss mercenaries.

Hitler made plans to invade Switzerland but fear of Swiss martial resistance and that the entire country was rigged to blow up made the cost to take Switzerland heavy enough even to dissuade Hitler. This goes to show how important having a strong defense.

One can make the argument that the Swiss banks benefited from Swiss neutrality because Switzerland is such a safe haven. In fact, our initial military doctrine was based on the Swiss hedgehog and they still maintain conscription even though the army has been greatly reduced. 

As for strategic depth, contrary to popular belief, govt not stupid and minister not stupid... if you had any knowledge of military strategy in Singaporean context, you’ll be able to know that the composition of SAF forces are for an offensive military doctrine and we only have 1 defensive formation; PDF. This is to address the lack of a strategic depth. If you need more hints, go google the Meeting line.

Defense treaties are quite useless if you can’t defend yourself. Ukraine has assurances from every Tom dick and Harry when they gave up their nukes, didn’t stop Russia from invading. The Brits were supposed to defend us in WW2, didn’t do us any good. The US will only interfere if their interests are threatened and for sweet sweet crude oil, trump doesn’t even want to honor NATO anymore.

e54wslg,WikiTextBot,"**2008 Russian military reform**

Significant reforms of the Russian Armed Forces were announced in October 2008 under Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov, and major structural reorganisation began in 2009. The stated aims of the reform are to reorganize the structure and the chain of command in the Russian army, and to reduce it in size.Key elements of the reforms announced in October 2008 included:



reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million by 2012;

reducing the number of officers;

centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres;

creating a professional NCO corps;

reducing the size of the central command;

introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff;

elimination of cadre-strength formations;

reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system;

reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.There had previously been several reform attempts such as the 1997 plan under defence minister Igor Sergeyev and the 2003 programme of President Putin (‘Urgent Tasks for the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’), the latter of which was very similar to the 2008 programme, as it emphasized already the need for reductions in personnel strength, a gradual decrease in the use of conscripts in favour of professional soldiers, the creation of a professional NCO corps and drastic changes to officer training and education. The 2003 program however moved at a very slow pace, mainly due to the unwillingness of the military to reform.

I can honestly say I hold 0% of loyalty to this country. If a war breaks out I'm running. I am not willing to die for a country that I hardly care about, this place is simply a decent place, but it's not a place i love so much that i'd rather die than live anywhere else."

Then you get the argument about low birth rates. Well, tough shit.

Maybe they can hold activities in NS that promotes relationships between both genders, so as soon as they get out they can be farmed by the government for babies. Also, what happened to the ""comrades"" argument?

People say that going to NS makes you friends. Why not use that effect by doing some activities that can be done with both genders? Then they can make friends too. And be married quick, as I said.

Or, better, with double the people in NS, cut the duration down by half too. Divide up the workload so everyone can take part. If times of crisis, everyone can get their hands dirty. Then, they get out in a year, and can get married! They'll be less tired, less likely to say, ""Fuck, I spent 2 years in NS, not going to get married until I had my fun.""

e557n1b,shimmynywimminy,"Once again, I'm no expert but I think it depends on what we expect a ""proficient fighting force"" to do. In my opinion the idea of preparing for a  pre-emptive strike to create ""strategic depth"" in the remote possibility of war with our neighbours is not worth the enormous costs. I envision the army as more of a defensive force/ armed militia, as in hunker down and fight street by street to make invading us as painful as possible. I think that would suffice as a deterrent with much less training neccessary (e.g. overseas exercises). Instead of trying to make conscripts into professionals, focus on the benefits of a conscript force (sheer numbers) to make Singapore as a whole more prepared. 

I would think that if our neighbours knew that there were 2 million (give or take) armed and trained militia who were ready to stand and fight, they would think long and hard before trying anything. Besides, we could still field a smaller professional force to supplement the larger militia. Not to mention the airforce and navy. 

As for commanders I think it would be neccessary for those who want to be officers or sgts to extend their service or sign on. That way we would have commanders who are really motivated/ interested in playing a more active role. Of course they would have to be paid more according to their rank and responsibility. "
e559tsf,Gungalley,So I suppose most other nations with conscription will have an unproficient army. 
e55sr0q,shimmynywimminy,Why man only can serve being a soldier? 
e55v96a,shimmynywimminy,"That's why those who want to be commanders should be required to extend their service or sign on (assuming most people would serve only 1 year or less). That way we ensure that commanders are well motivated and actually have a desire to serve actively in the army above and beyond what is typical, while those who would rather serve and f off can choose to serve for less time but have less responsibilities/power. The longer service period would also reflect the cost of the prestige and benefits of being a commander. We would also have to compensate commanders appropriately commensurate with their increased responsibilities. 

Change is unlikely because people in power are more comfortable with the status quo, that's true. But that doesn't mean we have to disregard suggestions that would improve the system out of hand. After all, on election day the power is not with the BGs, MPs and Ministers, but invested equally in every citizen, (whether REC or CDF) in the voting booth. If you believe in change, use that power to effect it!"
e55ul6u,shimmynywimminy,"If we were training an army to conduct advanced operations beyond our borders such as striking overseas into enemy territory, I would completely agree with you. But what I'm suggesting is that the chances of conflict happening are so low that it's not necessary or worth the huge cost, and that a similar level of deterrence could be achieved at a far lower cost. (When we talk about cost I'm referring not to money spent, which the govt has an incentive to reduce, but rather the sacrifices made by our conscripts, which the govt is all to happy to exploit.) 

I see the bulk of army not as a invasion force, but as a defensive/militia force that would, in the case of war hunker down and fight street to street to make invading as painful as possible. Under such a system, most soldiers wouldn't require such a high degree of specialization and training. Now I'm no expert but in absence of a real and immediate threat (like in Israel or SK), it's not worth it to try and make conscripts into professional soldiers. Rather, we would embrace the benefits of a conscript army (sheer numbers) to serve as a deterrent. I think our neighbors would think twice about ever invading us if they knew that 2 million people were armed and trained to resist enemy forces every step of the way. 

&#x200B;

That doesn't mean we would do away with units like Armour, Artillery, Engineers and Commandos, just that they would be a much much smaller part of our total strength, be comprised almost totally of full time regulars and merely complement the larger bulk of reserves. Of course the navy and air force are also currently mostly professional already so not much would change there.

>The best we can do is to make waging war hurt enough for the invaders to reconsider.

Ultimately the best we can do is not enough, and any of our neighbours can see through an invasion with enough political will and military might to spare, hence the need for redirected focus away from an ineffective Armed Forces into other methods of preserving the peace.

>we already know relying on other countries for our defense and security is ultimately a crap shoot (see: British Empire), so why go back and try something that we already know won't work? 

As I said, the goal is not to rely on other countries, but the establishment of international agreements with multiple countries involving a mutual exchange of services such that other countries also depend on the (mostly economic) opportunities we provide. This makes us indispensable to other countries and renders war unprofitable, not to mention the possibility of retaliation from our allies. The EU has already successfully shown that increasing economic interdependence is effective in preventing large scale conflicts even in a region as prone to war as Europe."

e54zfa4,lotcapp,">so this assumption is *not at all acceptable* in a debate over NS.

I make this assumption based on the fact that warfare between industrialized countries has become increasingly ""total"" in nature. Nation-states are now willing and able to go all out with the economy, industrial production and civilian mobilization all being utilised to their full extent for the purpose of waging war. Gone are the days of the Late Medieval Era where war was fought by knights and mercenaries while peasants simply toiled under a different master. 

>a large section of that would be significantly further behind in terms of operational readiness relative to even NSmen.

This is definitely true to some extent. However, I maintain that training is still unable to overcome the overwhelming odds we face in terms of manpower."
e54yab7,lotcapp,">Taking a look at Wikipedia, our neighbour’s armed forces sizes are actually not superior to ours. 

Malaysian Armed Forces: 110 000
Singapore Armed Forces: 72 000

>However the reality about creating a professional armed force is simply that SG has not enough people to do that. 

Hence the need for other methods of defence besides the armed forces.

>Also, wouldn’t that incur more costs? Our government budget is barely balanced as it is. 

Cut ministers' salaries, increase salaries of soldiers and firefighters. Let's be clear here, raising wages is not a question of ability, but one of willingness on our govt's part.

e553l7m,,[deleted]
e556mfb,justonetempest,"unfortunately I have to disagree with you there - the ability to defend ourselves doesn't *necessarily* give us the independence and neutrality. Any country that would seek to make us non-neutral doesn't only stand to gain politically, but most importantly economically. I don't think this is about defense as much as it is about politics and economics. The point is that if they have an interest in our neutrality (or lack thereof), they stand to gain from our position on the global stage. That very heavily diminishes the incentive to compromise us defensively, not only because they would in effect shoot themselves in the foot, but that important economic and political allies of ours would respond very negatively towards them. The only countries with real power to throw a wrench at us and not have other countries lash out militarily for fear of their position, power, and bulk are the US, China, Russia, Germany. And Germany doesn't even have a military - they've committed it to the EU. These 3 other countries would absolutely crush us militarily regardless. That's why for me it's not the size of the military that matters at all, and why I think necessary conscription is past its prime. I think we are possibly overcommitting resources to the military when we can review and focus military resources towards the construction of an extremely efficient, potent, advanced, and effective military that would seriously help in neutralising threats that are not Singapore-ending level. I know in warfare numbers matter, but if war happens in Singapore we are **necessarily** fighting a home war - there are **no** fringes of the country that we can carry out a war of attrition where numbers would be truly the difference. With a home war comes the home ground advantage, as well as the spirit of the soldier who fights for their family. We would be well-advised to be extremely well-versed in such forms of warfare and push forward our horizons into new definitions of what a military is, than to continue teaching recruits in pulau tekong how to put on camo paint for jungle warfare."
e557dm2,thoughtihadanacct,"Not saying transparency and accountability are unimportant, but uniquely to the military, you don’t want to be too transparent otherwise your (potential) enemy will know your strengths and weaknesses too well.  Imagine if they could track your expenditures and know what equipment you have, when you bought it (and therefore when the servicing/expiry dates are), etc. Or if they could track your manpower reports to know training results, how many people go awol, etc they could infer the morale of a unit or the saf as a whole for example.

So perhaps it’s better (necessary) for mindef to be able to hide some things from the general public (which includes outsiders) and only report to certain high level committees or to parliment in closed door sessions. But that requires trust from the public, which admittedly is lacking."
e554e5k,littlefiredragon,"A credible military cannot be made of a handful of motivated, well-trained, and well-paid soldiers; the size matters as well considering our already small size. I don’t know if people would want to serve as full-time men either, even if it is say twice the pay they could get as a white-collar office worker. Too many full-time soldiers also means less manpower towards other industries.

If war really does occur, I sincerely feel the Singapore army is incapable of mustering a worthwhile defence. The only edge we have is technological advances which is a debatable topic itself as most equipment for the typical men are outdated/damages/not maintained properly.

The only useful things right now are the SCDF, SPF and certain elite vocations which are sent to countries as relief aid which accounts for a small portion of NSFs.

In my opinion, in its current state, NS is mostly useless and might as well not be there. In my opinion the government is better off by offering much better incentives and higher pay for said vocations instead of a forced conscription. Do you have any idea how much taxes are wasted on this rather obsolete army lolz.

China has no force projection capabilities and they aren’t going to leave their 22000 km border and 14000 km coastline undefended. Even at the height of the Iraq war, the US had less than 200k troops on the ground.

Either way, even if Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia roll over without fight, we will likely face troops from their southern theater command which is about 20% of their strength with extremely long and fragile lines of communications. I think the SAF can give them a pretty good fight.

Invading by sea isn’t even an option as the Chinese navy has practically zero long range force projection capabilities, not for 20-30 years more. By which time, if that is a threat, our forces will adapt accordingly. We won’t win but we’ll give them a hard fight.

e55eph2,WikiTextBot,"**Tyranny of the majority**

Tyranny of the majority (or tyranny of the masses) refers to an inherent weakness of majority rule in which the majority of an electorate can and does place its own interests above, and at the expense of, those in the minority. This results in oppression of minority groups comparable to that of a tyrant or despot, argued John Stuart Mill in his famous 1859 book On Liberty.Potentially, through tyranny of the majority, a disliked or unfavored ethnic, religious, political, social, or racial group may be deliberately targeted for oppression by the majority element acting through the democratic process.American founding father Alexander Hamilton, writing to Thomas Jefferson from the Constitutional Convention, argued the same fears regarding the use of pure direct democracy by the majority to elect a demagogue who, rather than work for the benefit of all citizens, set out to either harm those in the minority or work only for those of the upper echelon. The Electoral College mechanism present in the indirect United States presidential election system, and the phenomenon of faithless electors allowed for within it, was, in part, deliberately created as a safety measure not only to prevent such a scenario, but also to prevent the use of democracy to overthrow democracy for an authoritarian, dictatorial or other system of oppressive government. As articulated by Hamilton, one reason the Electoral College was created was so ""that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications"".The scenarios in which tyranny perception occurs are very specific, involving a sort of distortion of democracy preconditions:



Centralization excess: when the centralized power of a federation make a decision that should be local, breaking with the commitment to the subsidiarity principle.

This is probably true.

However morale is extremely important for any military. I'm currently a NS man in Guards and I can tell you even in our reservist morale is extremely low. 

When we go thru ATEC and get Redcon1 the reaction from my clique was like ""wtf we so chui also can be called redcon1"". 

The belief that we can actually win any war is actually quite low - we just don't really see it looking at the clusterfuck of things happening during our ICTs.

On the actual topic of discussion - try to consider an alternative viewpoint, that our current state of affairs is a) abnormal; and b) a result of the processes we have in place. 

We just need to look at countries that did try to demilitarise, and see where they are at now. It's not a coincidence that Europe and Japan are remilitarising. Russia is putting on a massive military exercise *based on an invasion scenario* during a time when they're cutting back on social spending. The Korean peninsula is in a state of ever-flux. Countries that have thought they could get away with demilitarization are reversing course. Why do you think that is?

A valid argument could be that none of our neighbours are militarised to the extent of Russia or North Korea. But the considerations to take into account for this are a) purely on an as-is basis, the size of the militaries of our neighbours already outstrip us *with our conscription*, and b) militaries take time to build capacity, and cannot be put together instantaneously. A consequent argument could be made that we should tailor our military budget to that of our maintenance, which is valid - but that presupposes our military is actually growing, and that such maintenance should be done in such a manner that the relative gap between us and our neighbours is maintained. Pertinent side note is that Indonesia has been looking to strengthen their naval presence for a while now.

Teddy Roosevelt's idea of speaking softly while carrying a big stick is sound. If an argument otherwise is to be made, make it. It's not constructive to just tar everyone who disagrees with you with a label. Convenient, but utterly intellectually lazy. "

Heck even a single atom bomb will turn Singapore into rubble.

But once you have successfully invaded Singapore, what do you get? A snot sized pile of rubble and nothing more. Was the blood and treasure you spent on this snot sized pile of rubble worth it? 

Then you also have diplomatic moves. Remember the time when Indonesia named two of their warships after terrorists who bombed Singapore during Konfrontasi? Singapore immediately issued a declaration that as long as the warships had these names, they will never be allowed in Singaporean waters. Without a strong navy, this is not something we can back up with firm action and the Indonesians can act with impunity.

Make no mistake: there are no such thing as allies; only common interests. Having a strong military is part of how we Singaporeans protect *our* interests. "
e55307z,oklos,"> I make this assumption based on the fact that warfare between industrialized countries has become increasingly ""total"" in nature. Nation-states are now willing and able to go all out with the economy, industrial production and civilian mobilization all being utilised to their full extent for the purpose of waging war. 

This honestly seems like a rather overblown statement extrapolating too much from the relatively small number of major wars like WW2 or the Vietnam War. Such a scenario is arguably only applicable in the fairly extreme scenario that total warfare is relevant politically, which in turn would involve quite a number of other geopolitical and diplomatic concerns; total warfare is really only considered when the society or at least government deems the war so important as to make significant sacrifices in all other area, presumably due to a sense for fighting for survival. This is not the case, for example, in many 'skirmishes' between larger powers (e.g. the China-India border conflict), or more lopsided operations (the USA versus many smaller countries). For such a situation to develop between Singapore and her neighbours would involve an extreme breakdown of relations, to such an extent that ASEAN would basically have completely disintegrated.

Leaving aside perhaps the situation of these countries somehow degenerating into a military dictatorship, it would really take something extremely drastic for a democratically-elected government in those countries to persuade the populace to support total war against a small country like Singapore; just try to imagine a future President of Indonesia or PM of Malaysia trying to tell voters that they need to implement massive country-wide conscription to take down Singapore in a military invasion.

It's really not so easy to mobilise 'potential' manpower unless the nation is experiencing a clear existential crisis."

>be prepared for after-effects in the job market and society at large

How are the current effects of NS not already causing this? In addition to the lack of disappearing for 2 weeks every year, foreigners that come in to find jobs are also younger and willing to take lesser pay because they didn't burn 2 years of their lives getting paid bread crumbs under the pretext of ""protecting the nation""

Are we supposed to somehow accept this because it's been ""the way things are"" since forever? No fucking way dude

We're so deep into the sunk cost fallacy that the government doesn't dare to change this policy because of backlash from the population."
e55gob2,turtlings,"I see NS as compulsory , albeit the low pay and unnecessarily rigid structure. But your argument about exacerbating Singapore’s Aging population and low birth rate issue (?) applying heavily to women is flawed:

If I apply your logic to men: 

1) I could also counter with that delaying men’s career/future by two years is perhaps even more damaging as in traditional societal roles men should provide finical stability. This equates to less family planning and delayed childbirths or even no children.

2) if you apply your logic to males, are you saying that if males don’t serve NS our birth rate will go up and age of married couples will be younger as they should be able to start a family earlier right? females serving NS can then rely on males for financial stability to start a family unit as their life has been delayed. ( This is clearly not the case with males tho huh .)

That's not even including our regular forces, air force and navy which would continue to develop technologically and supplement the reserves. 

I'm not saying this reserve force would be the most well trained or technologically superior but I think the thought of having to invade a country where almost every citizen is armed and trained would be scary enough to deter any of our neighbors from ever invading us. "

NS states clearly the terms which you are to undergo, and the benefits that you receive as well as a citizen (for the wider community, not personal) is a pro. You get to book out, stay out even for some, receive at least some compensation for your time (whether it's enough or not is a separate issue), don't go hungry, have a nice bed to sleep in (most of the time), and generally you still have your freedom, despite being limited in some ways.

As to your strategic arguments, though I'm no military expert, I would think that any swift victory would require actual occupation of the island and I think that would be very very difficult to acheive if every single person was armed and trained, regardless of the artillery, armor or air advantage. And once again, we would still have a professional airforce, navy and army to support the reserves. 

Besides, it's highly unlikely that even our current armed forces would be able to acheive an outright victory in an armed conflict. The strategy behind our defence is to make hypothetically invading us so costly that the enemy doesn't even try.

No, there are different types of slavery. Not all slaves experience the same conditions, and there are varying treatments imposed on them. But, one such treatment is universal (and you said it yourself): having no choice to get out of the the hellholes they are living in.

>NS states clearly the terms which you are to undergo, and the benefits that you receive as well as a citizen (for the wider community, not personal) is a pro.

Whether you receive benefits from your slavery is irrelevant. Whether you receive compensation is also irrelevant (some slaves throughout history were also compensated). And whether the terms are clearly stated is also irrelevant. What does ""terms and conditions clearly stated"" even have anything to do with it? Even these ""terms and conditions"" are routinely broken anyway. I have a feeling you're just throwing stuff out hoping something ends up being relevant to the point.

The fact remains that your life is owned by the state, and that makes you a slave, and the state the slavemaster. The fact remains that the state can compel you to risk your life to fight for it and even force you to sacrifice your life. That is ownership. The the NSF loses their bodily autonomy.

>How can you compare this with the conditions slaves go through? The worse of them were not even treated as human beings. They were shipped to an unknown land, forced to shit on top of each other, and didn't even have enough space for them to stand upright like a human being, forced to work under the hot sun for nothing, whipped if they didn't comply.

Since when did I compare the conditions? I did not say NSFs faced exactly the same conditions slaves went through, although some are similar. If slaves didn't obey they might be whipped. If NSFs don't obey, what happens? They get arrested, sent to jail, and if they resist in self-defence, they get violence inflicted upon them by agents of the state, then sent to jail nevertheless.

>You really want to call NS slavery now?

Yes, and your nationalist sugarcoating doesn't change that. You are offended by the term slavery because it attaches negative connotations to a practice that you support. That's really all there is to it.

These people who had 2 years freed up can contribute to the work force economically, giving singapore an bigger edge on the global scale, and have a better national morale as they have the freedom to do what they want. Honestly I would rather have the saf spend more money on infrastructure and technology and increase our combat power per man than sticking to what is setup in the 1970s because we were poor back then have and have a terrible combat power to man ratio that we currently has.

You mention more flexibility is required but yet provide none of these suggestions. Flexibility in what? Jurisdiction? Postponing the service timeslot? Then why not just make it optional in the first place with scaling rewards depending on when you enlist?

The value of NS is not proportionate to the recompense the people going through it are getting right now. 

The fact that 99.99% of conscription would not volunteer clearly points out to that fact. There is absolutely no merit in going through it other than ""I don't want to be a criminal.""

ctpwigv,Hope83,"If you are referring to the SOS hotline, what you need to understand is that it might be difficult to get a call through at night as most people who feels depressed and/or suicidal tends to feel so at night and thus make the calls at night. 

Secondly, the volunteers who man the calls do their best to be empathic but they are not there to fix or solve your problems. Their main objective is to get you to not do anything that might harm yourself, and if possible get you to seek professional help in person. 

Third, they are not friends whom you can pour out for hours. They do have a time constraint and thus they cannot be on the phone with you for hours and hours. Some people may feel upset that it feels like a touch and go thing and not feel they are really being helped.

At the end of the day, they are doing their best to help whoever is calling them. 

All that being said, if you are feeling suicidal right now, you are welcomed to talk to any of us over at /r/sgkindness and I'm sure there are plenty of people here in /r/singapore who doesn't mind being a listening ear. 

Whatever that is bothering you, I'm sure you must be feeling despair and very helpless to have to consider calling the suicide hotline. But please do not give up. Create a throwaway account if you really feel the need to, but tell your story to someone so that others can be in a better position to understand and help you."
ctpwjv6,mwolfee,"I have not called the SOS before, but I have went to the doctors (and being warded) before.

Seeing professionals can be very hit or miss. Finding a doctor or a therapist may take you a while. You have to be more open because of that I think it's important to find a doctor and therapist that you can connect with and be comfortable with - otherwise sessions will be a waste.

Don't feel disheartened if you can't find a right one right off the bat. They do want to help and they also do understand that someone may not be entirely comfortable for whatever reason with them, so feel free to request for a change in doctors/ therapists if you feel the need to.

It's all really rich coming from me since I have done nothing of the above, but I do hope that you find the help that you need. I'm here at nearly all hours (barring 3am-7am when I'm probably out like a light) and will try to respond to PM if you need someone to talk to."
ctpwy8a,,"In my opinion, the suicide hotline is good if you are at your wit's end and need a vent. If you are looking for something that is longer term, try approaching a counsellor/psychiatrist/psychologist, they would be able to track your long term progress better. "

If you're okay with just chatting rather than calling, then try 
[ec2](https://www.ec2.sg/). These are professional counsellors who will chat with you for free. 

I'm not sure if they still have this, but they used to have a Chat Hub at Scape where you can if you're a youth. They have a professional counsellor there who will talk to you and refer you to another professional (usually IMH) should you need it. 

You can also try Lakeside Family Service Centre. They provide free counselling.

If you have friends, or any love ones, talk to any of them whom you can trust. They would want to hear, they would want to be there for you. 

In moments of hopelessness, just ending it all always feels like it's the better option. It can even have that tinge of comfort just thinking of it, thinking and feeling that all this pain will cease once I end it all. But... if you end your life, there's no coming back from it. 

You are loved by those who cares about you. You are not a burden to them. Maybe their collective love for you can't weigh more than whatever reasons there are to consider ending it all, maybe you are just too tired to care, and maybe no one can ever understand the pain you are going through. But it doesn't mean that there aren't people who would try their darnest best to care for you, to be there for you, to lift you back up and to ride this out with you.

Usually they're perceptive enough to tell if you're engaging in suicide ideation or if you're genuinely suicidal, and if it's the latter, they will most definitely inform your parents.

> Lastly, the policemen interviewing him, couldn't they wait for an adult/lawyer before taking his statement? How will a 14 yr old ever know what his legal rights are?

in some countries (most notably the US) you have a constitutional right to legal counsel as well as to silence

basically this means that if you're being interrogated and you don't have a lawyer present you can sit down and shut up until you do and they can't do anything about it

but in Singapore the right is circumscribed, ostensibly for reasons of efficiency

so basically you can't do that; if you do you are liable to have an adverse inference drawn against you in court (i.e. the judge will be like ""you jibai why never say earlier??? i donch believe you"")

rather you can only get a lawyer when it is ""reasonable"" to expect one - taking into account that it may impede the police investigation.

and yes this is a problem even for grown men because often the facts that support a legal defence may seem irrelevant to a layman so he may not think to mention them until he sees a lawyer, at which point he may be seen to be making facts up on the spot to get out of a guilty verdict"

d0lq11u,ussingthrowaway,"This is the best post on the subject I've seen.  The government is in full damage control mode because they don't want to have a conversation about exactly these things, because that might call for people to question the Protocols.  Instead they've attempted to change the conversation to a bunch of insignificant details:  

**FACT**: It was **3** Officers.  Not **5**

**FACT**: Benjamin was offered food but declined it.

**FACT**: WHO CARES.  

There's very little doubt, in my mind at least, that the SPF and the School followed protocol, and thus did nothing ""wrong"" or illegal.  However, I think many people, myself included, can see that those protocols may need revision as it seems like the protocols themselves are less than stellar.

I'm sorry I don't have actual  answers for you.  To be fair, only the SPF and government do.  Maybe if people keep asking questions like this though, they'll be compelled to answer.

One point, there are no protections stating that minors have access to counsel during questioning.  The Law Society successfully petitioned, just last year, to get a program underway which provides volunteers for medically disabled people being questioned.  If you think that minors should have similar protections, then contact your government."

We thus have the extraordinary spectacle of Singaporeans ""putting it out there"" that a 14-year-old boy should be fully responsible for his decisions and not expect too much sympathy after he commits suicide (and before he ever had the chance to defend himself).

d0lwapm,PandaEyes,"Sorry, where does it say in the link you've provided that in Singapore we dont have the presumption of innocence until proven guilty?

d0lzneo,EconCow,">  when the Court acquits an accused, it simply means that the Court is not convinced that he is guilty. This is because the Court does not have to go into the question of whether the accused is in fact innocent.  An acquittal (often) simply means that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

See also Chan Sek Keong's (Chief Justice, 2006-2012) remarks in 1996:

> It is based on the well known, but still misunderstood, statement that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. This assumption is contrary to reality. An accused person is charged for an offence only if there is sufficient provable and admissible evidence against him on which there is a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction. The reality is that many, if not most, accused persons are factually guilty, ie, they have done what the charges allege they have done.

The presumption of ""innocent until proven guilty"" is much weaker in Singapore than in say the US or France. In Singapore we say that Benjamin Lim hasn't been found guilty of an outrage of modesty and is *legally* innocent, though he may well be *factually* guilty.

In the US or France they'd simply say that he is innocent, *legally* and *factually* and in every other way."
d0lv0fe,ussingthrowaway,"I think a minor should be given access to legal counsel or at the very least to their parents, before questioning.  I don't think a counselor from the school is good enough, as that is just another adult which may more may not have the interest of the child in mind.

I think **all** official police interviews (meaning done in the station) should be video recorded and the existence of those videos should be public record (not the content, but the existence, so those with a valid legal claim would know to go asking for them if they had a right to get them.)

On a broader scale, I think the government, if it cares about Justice, should be taking steps to educate the populace about concepts like the presumption of innocence and burden of proof.  These should be covered in primary school.  

edit: I don't see anything else wrong with what they did.  Who cares if one plain clothes officer or a dozen uniformed officers came to the school.  If people don't presume guilt, then being questioned by the police wouldn't be a big issue.  I suspect that the call to the parents ""asking"" if they thought Benjamin should stay home from the trip was probably more implicitly stating ""Benjamin **should** stay home from the trip, **right?**"" but I don't know.  If that is the case though, then I think the school messed up by treating him as guilty before he was."
d0m1tf2,PandaEyes,"You might be cherrypicking a little.


Elsewhere in Shanmugam's answer : 
> 16. Mr de Souza has asked if the Government supports the ""presumption of innocence"".  Sir, let there not be any doubt on this point: the presumption of innocence is an important and fundamental principle, and is one of the foundations of our Criminal Justice System. The Government is absolutely committed to upholding the presumption of innocence, as a core principle in our commitment to the Rule of Law.  There is no intention to question or qualify that principle in any way. 


also you might have misstated the understanding in the US, and i have never understood US law to mean what you say that a finding of not guilty in a court means that a court is saying that the accused is factually innocent, but he is just protected under double jeopardy: 
>18. It is possible that some confusion had arisen because this is a technical area and there is tendency in common parlance to equate a finding of ""not guilty"" in court with actual innocence.  A recent article by the Massachusetts Bar Association points out this common mistake and calls for more precise terminology. A finding of a ""not guilty"" is not to be equated with actual innocence.


furthermore, as the court in a criminal trial does not consider, as a matter of fact or law, whether the accused is innocent, it seems strange an acquital means that the court thinks the accused to be *factually* innocent.


Also, Chan Sek Keong's remarks were made when he was an AG, so he could not have represented the courts or minlaw in the capacity of a Chief Justice. they were also dealt with at length in shanmugan's speech: 
>The AG did not question that principle.  He was simply pointing out the reality of the trial system: that a person may have committed a crime but nevertheless, the Prosecution may not succeed in Court, because of a gap between the commission of a crime and the prosecution's ability to prove it in Court.  The presumption of innocence does not preclude us from acknowledging that possibility.  As I stated earlier, the Court can only look at the evidence in Court and must acquit the accused (if there is any reasonable doubt), even if the Court thinks that he probably committed the crime - because such a probability is not enough for conviction under our law.



edit: also, i realise that I have not really commented on the rest of your original comment:
>In other countries, everyone is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Not so in Singapore.
We thus have the extraordinary spectacle of Singaporeans ""putting it out there"" that a 14-year-old boy should be fully responsible for his decisions and not expect too much sympathy after he commits suicide (and before he ever had the chance to defend himself).
It is probably precisely of such attitudes that created the perfect storm leading to young Benjamin Lim's suicide.


Not sure how executive or judicial attitudes toward presumption of innocence is that related to public opinion of ""singaporeans"". In fact, whereever you look at in the world, whether in the US, france, UK, you will always find a group of locals who do 'trial by jury' and proclaim guilt or innocence without access to most of the facts.


I also don't think that anyone thinks that what happened is just, a suicide is a tragedy regardless of whether the boy is guilty or not, but I wouldn't attribute this to the 'presumption of guilt or innocence' thing, in that sense its somewhat irrelevant. even if he punched the girl, noone would want him to commit suicide - this cannot be anyone's perception of justice.

what?

no. 

the whole point of the presumption of innocence is that you do *not* find someone innocent. you find them *not guilty*. 

also I don't really see why you're lumping France in with the US because they follow totally different legal traditions"
d0lvykn,AzureLemon,"From what i observe based on your opinions, you seemed to be heavily bias against the police. I feel that your idea about the recording of all interviews is abit difficult to achieve due to the sheer logisitics. Why does the government need to educate the populace about concepts like the presumption of innocence and burden of proof? This has very little to do with justice as these are simply people's opinions and does not mean that they are correct at all. Furthermore, the minister has mentioned that the police obtained CCTV footage of the occurring incident thus i feel that thats why singaporeans are already deeming the boy as guilty. You seem to be extremely against the organisations of Singapore as well? Like have you considered the fact that perhaps the parents may have severely lectured their son about this entire incident especially when he gave an admission of guilt. Singaporean parents tend to be extremely harsh and that could have also led to the boy's death. Anyway i do agree with you that the minor should have had his parents or legal counsel by his side tho."

By hanging.

>Is what I mentioned a common way for one who wants to suicide to do suicide?

No it is not, since there are simpler ways to achieve the same outcome. 

The courts have been given the power to exempt certain individuals from capital punishment in 2012. Judges have been favouring life-imprisonment over capital punishment since then. In 2012 and 2013, there were zero cases of capital punishment.

Chances are, one would get life-time jail term for drug trafficking, so it is not very smart to attempt ""assisted suicide"".

Also, you ask many weird questions."
d2d1gg4,llosa,"> Can one who wants to do suicide simply bring 500 grams of Cannabis from the United States to Singapore for assisted suicide? 

From a purely hypothetical perspective, this is not an efficient way to die. Trials take time, you might be sent for a mental evaluation, and worst come to worst, the sentence might even be commuted to life in prison. This has happened even in murder cases like that of Mathavakannan Kalimuthu. Note that on death row, you only have 3 square meters of space, 2 x 30 min of exercise a day, and a bucket for washing. You can only watch TV 4 days before the execution.

> How is one killed by the death penalty in Singapore?

Hanging at Changi Prison on Friday morning. The method is specifically long drop hanging, which has the goal of breaking the neck of its victim. Decapitation can occur if the rope is not properly stretched and oiled, as in the case of Saddam Hussein. I am not sure of how efficient hanging is in Changi Prison as nobody has lived to complain.

> Is what I mentioned a common way for one who wants to suicide to do suicide?

Not at all. It puts you through too much preliminary suffering and stress, and if it goes wrong it really goes wrong (see: life in prison). Most people would prefer to die on their own terms, in a place and time of their own choosing. "

When we pulled the body out, his face was swollen to twice its size, and half an eyeball was missing, probably eaten by fish. As we were bringing him onto the boat, his belly ruptured and covered me and 2 other guys with decomposing liquids. Had to throw away my brand new set of no. 4 after that.

Good luck washing the smell off too. Gut wrenching.

If youre talking about physical intensity all cases are quite different really. A legit RTA would probably have you busy working and toiling the entire time (30mins-1hr+??) and then you have farmland fires which you will need to attend for 24 hours, go home after your shift, and during your next duty you will go back and fight the fire some more. Its not as intense but it gets really draining after awhile honestly

But the worst is when you turnout and the incident involves a close friend. Someone I know once went to an RTA and one of his good friends got hit by a car while riding his bike.

Story short, both of them were actually competing to “race” who would return back faster along the old route towards Jalan Bahar(the Old CCk road before the expansion). 

Alighting from my vehicle, i went closer to the site, to many horror, both lorry had overturned (god knows how) and one of the firefighters had is hand pinned under the lorry. ( lucky thing not amputated). And the rest of the fireman are either flung out or all over the road.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. It is produced by the specialised ependymal cells in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull.

e55gty2,Assault_Penguin,">Most of the times , they pass out even if they DONT die mid air

Okay, okay, okay let's pull this back to square one. It seems that you are adamant that there are people who actually dies in mid-air.

Bottom line, nobody actually dies in mid-air. I hate to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-a-person-who-jumps-from-a-certain-height-will-die-from-the-effects-of-free-falling-instead-of-on-impact-Why-And-if-so-how-do-people-who-do-parachuting-survive) as a source, but maybe [this](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/09/13/1459026.htm) would convince you? The only way you are dying ""mid-air"" is from lack of oxygen or from coldness from thousands of feet above. 

As many people quotes : ""It's not the speed that kills you, it's the sudden stop.""

God, you are one act atas, act educated cunt."
e55giab,Assault_Penguin,"Ah okay, I see you are an authority on mental health. I hate running through people's post history but you're a private ""A"" level candidate. May I know the source of your wide array of knowledge?

clwixgm,Hope83,"Go to your nearest Family Service Centre to seek financial assistance from the social workers.

clwl1ga,gofernf,"As someone who also has had a family member with suicidal thoughts admitted into IMH, I can sincerely emphatize with what you and your family are going through. 

First off, please don't think of suicide as a viable way of ending everything. It just causes more pain and sorrow for the loved ones you leave behind. They will end up blaming themselves for not being able to stop you. Follow up with the medical appointments with your psychiatrist and take your meds as instructed(probably Risperidone), it really does help alot.

As mentioned above, approach the FSC and possibly CDC for financial aid.
There will most definitely be some form of financial assistance coming your way if you explain your current situation to them.

&nbsp;

Most importantly, please do not give up hope. The abovementioned family member is now happily and gainfully employed and is nearly fully recovered so **IT CAN BE DONE**."
clwjyoz,mrkiasume,"Not to sound like an ass. But I think it's very hard to get a loan legally without any income. Not many are willing to lend money with no returns in sight. Maybe perhaps if you could find another job to supplement your income?

Look, you have two issues.

1. You're ill. Are you seeing a doctor? Are you getting any treatment for your depression? You need to address this. It's not going to go away on its own.

2. You have money issues. You mentioned having a job. Since you're employed I'm going to assume you have an income. Correct me if I'm wrong, your post was pretty vague. Can you get a line of credit? If you have debt and don't feel like you can handle it, can you speak to your bank or a financial advisor (your bank will have one) to help deal with it?

clxa10o,SkittyLover93,"You need to realise that people only want to help those who want to help themselves. People aren't annoyed with you because you're asking for advice.

After that, you proceed to insult people who responded in this thread (when you should in fact be grateful that people took the time to respond at all) and complain that people don't know how you feel (when in fact a significant number of reddit users suffer from depression as well).

If you were an outsider reading this thread, do you think you look like a likeable person whom people would want to help?

You may suffer a heavier burden than others, but that doesn't change the fact that if you don't learn to communicate with others better and take more ownership of your problems, people are not going to want to help you."

cgjt571,aejhaefg,"Reading this piece of news inspired feelings of outrage and regret as this piece reminded me of the times I tried but failed to stand up for peers who were victims of abuse of power but was too gutless to go the whole way and complain to higher powers. If you're an NSF reading this, bear in mind that the caricatures of NS boys with happy endings in shlock movies like Ah Boys to Men superficially represent the experiences of the typical enlistee, and that there are actually many with a fragile state of mind among us. 

The guy whom you always thought was simply a little aloof/off in the head and overly perfectionist could be the next Ganesh. I'm not saying here that we should suspect every person with mild eccentricities to have mental illnesses, but that such tragedies remind us that we should always treat everyone with decency and kindness and not discriminate against them, even if you think they are weirdos.

That being said, in an environment where you have an iron rice bowl and a guaranteed replenishment of labour~~slaves~~ every few months, its little wonder that such an environment draws out the malice within the people in power every time, which is why stories of abuse of power among NSFs are so common. The people doling out the extras simply view it as a tool to crush the spirits of the men and to ensure there won't be anymore trouble, because really, why bother to be a decent person and go the extra mile to motivate the men and find out their problems when they don't get paid anymore then what they already get? The prevailing mentality is to just throw extras at the problem till it goes away, which ironically worked too well in this case.

And fuck the guy who gave 14 extras, which btw is illegal to do so in the army, iirc there are a maximum number of extras that can be given to men, even officers do not get that many and usually get 7. Lieutenant Fucker here is probably one of those types who slowly accumulate offences against an NSF and then just give them all in one shot just to fuck with them or to have a strong enough case to send them to DB. Lieutenant Fucker's colleagues who did not flag out Ganesh's mental illness were almost as complicit in pushing him to suicide as this sort of thing should be discovered in superior interviews.

On another note, I'm surprised by the fact that this news hasn't been more widely reported as this is a grossly egregious case of misuse of power and negligency given that it pushed the guy to suicide. So far I have only seen it in the tabloid the New Paper."

cgjtc1s,aejhaefg,"You are not wrong about the fresh docs serving their last year of NS thing, most of them are there to fill up the numbers of MOs and have almost no practical experience at all. The thing is that mental conditions are often flagged out, esp in cases with solid patient histories like Ganesh's. Unfortunately, some like Ganesh occasionally fall through the cracks. 

The real tragedy here is not of a guy who fell through the cracks in the system and consequently suffered as a result of bureaucratic fuckups, akin to tragedies where people with heart conditions or asthma are posted to combat vocations/NSmen with hidden problems dying during IPPT as they over exert themselves to avoid wasting time at RT. Spinning the story as one where Ganesh was simply a victim of circumstances greatly diminishes the enormity of the abuses and mistreatment leading to his suicide, which is the real tragedy here. The kind of questions posed in the article 

> All this begs these questions: Should schizophrenics be allowed to serve in the army even as clerks and or administrative assistants? How should someone with schizophrenia be treated in the army? Did the Singapore Armed Forces and MINDEF provide counselling to the parents of the bereaved? And if the armed forces and MINDEF did not provide Ganesh’s distraught family members with counselling, why not? Also, what action did SAF and MINDEF take to ensure that Ganesh did not succumb to a negative mindset?

is the typical shit stirring, vindictive mentality that Singaporeans have in the event of a tragedy. It does not help Ganesh's family get the justice they deserve, nor does it help anyone who is currently being abused. It completely ignores the fact that Ganesh **was stable before enlisting**, and hence for all intents and purposes, would not have been treated as someone being of unsound mind by the Army. The point of this whole investigation should be focused on the abuses of power and the neglect of the officers in not highlighting the deteriorating mental condition of their man, but instead doing their best to exacerbate his steady descent into schizophrenia. 

It seems to me that the enormity of the crimes by Ganesh's superiors is something that is glossed over by the media, and all it is doing is putting its usual spin of ""suay guy who fell through bureaucratic crack"" and doing its fucking worthless after action review style of articles, completely ignoring the circumstances of the real tragedy here. 
"
cgkmi4b,aejhaefg,"There is nothing to justify getting 14 extras in one sitting under the SAF punishment guidelines afaik. IIRC, the maximum for a man-level clerk like Ganesh is 3 extras. And on the contrary, I hope the officer never rests easy for the rest of his life as he shall bear the guilt of pushing his subordinate over the edge with his unlawful, Draconian punishment. If he has a conscience."
cgkmkk0,aejhaefg,"> Even if it does, it'll be temporary and then things will go back to normal.

I slightly disagree with you here. Such tragedies should serve as the spur for the authorities to introduce checks into the system such as more anonymous 360 interviews along with the regular staff interviews, and harsher punishments for instances of abuse of authority(dismissal or DB). Tougher regulations will ensure commanders don't take the endlessly renewing supply of labour for granted.

In this case however I am not optimistic due to the inherent stigma against mental illnesses in Singapore, and the circumstances of Ganesh's death would probably be cast as work stress brought about by his OCD. Which is clearly bullshit as he was marked from the start and his superiors ignored his history of mental illness, and did not ask about any underlying problems he could have had. "
cgkmmc7,aejhaefg,"As far as I'm aware, this case was not brought to mainstream attention and only featured in the tabloid the New Paper. As to why, I can only speculate. Perhaps the fact that the army keeps harping upon Ganesh's history of mental illness to detract the abuse and mistreatment he encountered from the narrative concerning the circumstances of his suicide renders this not newsworthy, as it is viewed as a case of a ""psycho who killed himself, no surprises there"". Or more unlikely, it is simply the government machinery at work again to hide the fuckups of the SAF from the public.

**EDIT**: Seriously though, more people should be reminded of this. The tales of mismanagement and abuses of power towards NSFs may have been flogged about the SAF more freely than Singapore's spending on defence, but we must always be reminded of the fact that these things can lead to tragedy and can cost innocent lives. **Laughing it up and telling people to suck thumb is no panacea for guys like Ganesh.** **Upvote to create visibility for this story, not because you think, ""fuck SAF"", but to remind people of the need for decency towards each other, especially if you are in a position of power.**

"
cgk1b9g,loonylovegood,"Someone behaves erratically and the superiors think he's just 'trying to make things difficult', so they use punishments to make him learn, or to show who's boss. Something like that?"
cgk428t,freedaemons,"NS changes a lot people, by testimony I know, but not always for the better. I know I came out from NS conditioned by my immediate superiors, higher ranked regular sergeants, to completely lose my sense of discipline and seize every opportunity to slack off. It's impossible to blame NS for this anywhere but online, because people will just say you're weak-willed. It's the environment that conditioned such behaviour, it's a massive social experiment where the testers are part of the experiment."
cgkmgy5,aejhaefg,"NS does have a propensity to change guys for the worse. Unless you're not a surplus tiny cog in a big machine that does not necessarily need more tiny cogs to go faster,there is no incentive to do better at a job where most of the people get paid $2+ per hour and have to do overtime w/o pay(guard duty). In my time in NS, I was one of those who saw no reason to go the extra mile and would only do what was minimally required of me to avoid punishment. I continued this behaviour until one day I asked my friend whom people viewed as one of those ""siao on"" types , why bother at all to work hard in this kind of shitty environment which shows little reward to your hard work? 

His response was that he did it so as not to lose his competitive edge later on in life, which I found to be especially true in the years after army. Work ethic is something that needs to be maintained in all facets of your life and is not something that can be switched on when you book out and switched off when you book in. Many including myself convinced ourselves that as this was a Fucking Waste of Time, it was OK to slack off and be unproductive since our efforts would go to waste anyway other than to make our superiors look good, when deep down we simply had the urge to be lazy. And this laziness is an insidious thing which eventually permeates all aspects of your life, especially since you ""practise"" being lazy for the majority of the time you are in camp.

So to those who think we are fortunate to go to NS because it molds us into better, tougher people, I say that you are wrong, because when you encounter the drudgery of the semi bureaucracy that is the SAF, the red tape surrounding the Sisyphean activities you partake in will draw in close to suffocate you gradually. It is the ultimate trap for young men at the stage of their lives when they have the most ambition. And to those in somewhat mundane vocations who had a positive NS experience, power to you for maintaining a positive mindset and keeping sane by finding meaning even in the most pointless of activities knowing it will benefit you in the future, be it in your vocations as clerk, rifleman, storeman, signaller, medic, or even the lifeguards who clean the camp swimming pools.

And for those reading this post who find me anti-NS, I assure you that I fully agree with the conscription policies that allow our defence force to ""Israel"" it against any aggressors. But I believe that the NS experience for the young men of Singapore will always need improvement."
cgkn03a,freedaemons,"I was well aware that I am especially susceptible to influence from environments like this, but there was nothing I could do about it in NS. I'm not that smart a guy, but I chose to enter one of the top sec schs and jcs here back then, with the mentality that the good work ethic would rub off on me, friends with good habits would influence me, and to a significant extent it worked. I graduated with mediocre grades, but I really believe that being in that sort of environment completely changed my outlook on life and attitude towards achieving things.

Then NS happened. Now I'm in the process of switching courses in uni after 2 years of study and 1 gap year of quarter-life crisis. Not necessarily a failure, some would say, but let's be honest, in Singapore this is what failing in tertiary education means. I have to struggle to build up those habits and routines by myself now, and not being in a fixed uni course makes my situation all the more isolating, in a situation like this I'm really down to only a couple close friends from way back."
cgl38rr,mrslavepuppet,"I think it's fair to say that there's a time limit on how long you want to keep blaming the system and not make it a point to change yourself. Plenty of us made it through NS and transited into civilian life somehow. You can't change the past, but your future is in your own hands. Press start. "
cgl4bpx,freedaemons,"Why should there be a time limit? When it comes to acknowledging that the ladies have an advantage in having a seamless education and getting started with their careers earlier that has a long-term effect, no matter how diminishing, we openly recognise that it is a sacrifice the men male for the sake of the nation. Why do you feel it is not equally important to recognise that at the same time, the environment in the military has the very same immediately detrimental but long term effect on a person? What happens in those 2 years sets a person back in multiple ways, not just loss of time. The reality is that a lot of the qualities that make a good soldier make for a poor citizen."
cgl8f0w,mrslavepuppet,"Even if you win this argument, you still have to serve NS and 10 more years of reservist. You still have to carry on with your own life. The government doesn't care, we don't really care. Make what you want out of your own life. It's really pointless to dwell in self pity and lament how NS fucked you up. You aren't getting anywhere with that.

edit: The point of my previous comment was more along ""Yes, NS messed some people up, what do you want to do about it from now on?"" "
cglbzvf,freedaemons,"If nobody cares, then we should just not talk about it, yeah. Just who is drowning in self-pity? It's sad that you need to resort to impugn others' ability to manage their life to make you feel better about yourself. What is happening here is a simple statement and discussion about what can be improved about NS. You want to tell the family and loved ones of the soldier who died that nobody cares that their son died?"
cglc1rn,mrslavepuppet,"I was talking about you. Not trying to disrespect the dead, he wasn't the one going on about how NS fucked him up, though it did. "
cglc3pr,freedaemons,"Well that would be kind of hard, seeing as he's dead. Why do you think we're discussing this anyway, isn't it because NS did indeed fuck him up? What I am otherwise doing with my life is not pertinent to the point about NS I am trying to make here, so I don't bring it up. "

e6ex8so,Acrux99,"How did CPF investment topic suddenly become NS issue? Stay on track of CPF if you want to talk about it. Now while I agree that nothing in life is guarenteed, you fail to understand that CPF interest rate is set by the Government. That means in a dire economic crisis, they can reduce the CPF return rate to 0% just to balance their books, and if it is a bull market, they can just cap the returns at 2.5% and pocket the difference. But the government has done neither of those During the 2008 crisis flat 2.5% and the recent bull runs CPF remained at flat 2.5% (if your OA balances are at least $20k up to $60k u get additional 4%). 

Now on to the topic of NS. I've been through it, am still going through Reservist and hate every waking moment of it. But I have always seen the importance of it. We cannot take our peace for granted. Time and time again humanity never fails to dissapoint us.  Stronger countries oppressing weaker ones in terms of military or financial strength. Your mobile phone you are using to type your post was made by a worker in a country where the phone itself could cost a whole years salary to some but may just be a month's salary to you. All this made possible through the pillars od foundations laid by our pioneers. NS is one of hose pillars which should never be removed.

There is no need to change your mindset about NS. Because there is no sane person I know who loves NS. But what you need to do is improve your argument about NS and why it should not be viable in this day and age.
"
e6eowie,MamaJumba,"I come in peace. OP, you really sound a lot like this Lim Tean I happened to watch on YouTube. Might appeal to the 18-year-old (and NS-serving) me, but now sounds like unsubstantiated rhetoric to me.

Yes, I do agree that the treatment (monetarily, especially) of our NSFs is very poor and the irony is strong when the government rationalises it as a ""service"" to the nation and yet a minister's pay is pegged to the median of the top 1000 earners (with a discount).

That aside, when you mention ""Opportunity costs may be up to $100k"", can I suggest that with our larger and (relatively) politically unstable neighbours, the real opportunity cost for **not** having NS is far greater than $100k. Of course, I infer from your post that you think we should abolish NS. But if you were arguing for the reduction of the NS period down to 1.5 years or even 1 year, I will be on your side. But your style of writing eliminates any room for discussion."
e6et3nw,NotSiaoOn,"Sigh. OP, I write this for others who may potentially read your post, not for you. You seem too far down the rabbit hole to be saved.

On CPF and how we can get guaranteed returns, the CPF board invest the funds in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS）which are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government and which are only available to the CPF board.

OP is technically right that there are always limits to guarantees but the guarantee given by the Singapore government is one of the strongest you can get. Don't need to take the government's word for it, look at the low interest rate the government has to pay on its bonds.

The proceeds from the SSGS are then invested by the government, presumably in higher yielding investments which are of higher risk. What exactly do they invest in? It doesn't really matter to a CPF member as our exposure is to the Singapore Government, not these individual investments. What this means in plain English then is that, it doesn't matter if any of the government's specific investments doesn't pan out, so long as the Singapore government itself doesn't default, CPF members will get our money back.

These are all public information. So if you believed OP without checking on this, you are part of the reason why fake news is becoming so prevalent.

But I digress, effectively what this means is that the government is using its ability to withstand the losses from changes in the financial cycle to invest in riskier investments and then pay a portion of those returns to CPF members who should not be expected to and may not be able to take on the same level of risk. The Government can take the hit from paper losses on its portfolio at a specific point in time of an economic crisis but a retiree needing the funds for day to day needs cant.

Now as to whether the government itself will default, the consensus from credit rating agencies (see the triple A ratings) and markets alike is that it's extremely unlikely. Is it theoretically possoble? Yes. But again, the consensus is that this is extremely unlikely. Even in the event that the Government loses shit loads of money on its investments, it can still go to the markets to borrow money at low interest rates before defaulting on its debt including the SSGS to CPF and in turn CPF members. That may need some change in law though as currently the government issues bonds for policy reasons (can google if interested) and not to finance its expenditure (which is what most governments issue bonds for). There are therefore legal restrictions on how it can use the money from bonds issuance and the general idea is that it can only be used for repaying the bonds and interest).

Bottom line is this - on whether the government would default, would you trust the opinion of the markets and professional rating agencies or that of a incoherent poster on reddit. Both are not perfect, but I certainly know which has more expertise.

Edit: formatting, grammar etc and added in last para."
e6f4551,danielling1981,"Skipped the bunch of side tracked text. If it's relevant I'll read it again.

There's reasons why government backed investments are triple A. There's also reasons why some countries backed are not.

The statement is ""solid guarantee"". By reading it and understanding the implied meaning, it means not 100% but very good chances.

Back by government also means it's tied very closely with the countries economy.

I became much more disciplined and improved my grades to Ace my results in the remaining years. I felt I became into a more attractive person physically because I started exercising, and I built on my character and became a more interesting person to hang out with.

I then went on to serve Army and got into OCS. It definitely took a toll on my where I became a little more complacent with myself, didnt put in my family and relationship. I OOC due to a heart injury, got hospitalised in ICU for 1 week. Looked at my poor mother cry and felt so helpless, gained shit ton of weight, became a little depressed, R/S went to shit and broke up.

Now, I’ve became a person who I am proud to be. I’ve lost all the weight I gained, improved my Stamina to a point that it’s better than my Cadet days and I’m aiming to run a 21KM next year. In my pictures with my friends now, I’m happy with the way I look, how happy I am. I’m confident with myself again where I can strike conversation with strangers and meet new people.

e7kbzon,catastrophexx,Yes I felt the same as you did during NS. As it's the same repetitive shit always. What you could do is to really plan ahead what to do after ord and try to stick to it. Another thing is to speak to your camp mates and talk about it as they are also in the same shoes as you. Hope this helps you in some way.... Coming from a ord personnel a few months back. 
e7kn4u6,squirrelballon,"You said: Prior to NS I was way more driven to grow myself, actively meeting new friends, learning new skills.

I don’t know you at all but aren’t you forgetting that NS is actually the perfect time and olace to do that? You don’t have responsibilities or have to worry about the next pay check. 

I’m not putting you down. Just suggest maybe you should seriously think about your view of NS. It might be you went in already thinking it will be a waste of time and so you experienced exactly what you wanted to be true.

I honestly wish you all the best. It’s been a long time since I was in ns and I totally understand what you’re feeling. Remember that every single day is different and you don’t have to be defined by your past.

e7m3150,Nayuta_kani_,"I have alr said for the past 5 years that NS and the fact that Mindef is so stingy with deferments are the reasons why career choices are so limited, there are some jobs where you just have to start young and devote yourself to. Being force to serve NS the minute I finish tertiary studies takes away your devotion time and takes away the time for you to hone your skills, honestly the law where NSF are not allowed to work outside NS should be abolished "
e7kgwog,danielling1981,"If you are stuck with a negative environment then it's terrible.

But in a supportive environment, wonders can happen.

More than 15 years ago.

My unit is not slack. My company is the 2nd worse off in terms or work load in the company.
We are not slack not because of mis management but due to too many request for our services to the extent we have events management scheduling, etc.

Through all this.

I had about 12 nsf?

About 4 of my nsf were doing their part time degree.

1 nsf was semi running a business that he set up before NS.
This nsf at the same time submitted entries in both arts and tech design competitions.

Now.
1 is a clothing line creater.
1 is a over achiever Now.
1 is a health product e com owner.
Dunno about the rest.

Some would suggest that this could be humble brag but it's true.

I was genuinely amazed by the achievements of these young guys when given the support they need.

There was another crazy regular who picked up a blind M203 HEDP round (the golden one) and waved it in front of us.

I never felt more alive."
e7m60vr,paddingtonthesock,"I guess its how you want to treat NS. For me I learned alot during NS as I took the time to read up more on investing and finance, learnt (attempted to learn) a third language. And just treat the daily tasks as something which will eventually end.

Trust me, when you get a job, you will experience this very same experience you are getting now. Life is mostly nothing exciting and sometimes tough, punctuated with fleeting moments of happiness.

You can never truly know what happiness is unless you have endured tough times or sorrow.

I don't think any of my friends were particularly scarred by NS after leaving, so you don't need to worry about that.

I served at a time where smartphones and tablets doesn't exist yet, we brought books and tabletop games to spend our evenings. Training was tough as I was in a specialized unit but with your platoon mates in the same boat  and suffering together means a lot.

I suppose you millennial are thinking that there'll be no war etc etc, but think about the positive ways you evolve as a person and what NS has taught you. National defense is important at this age and time, you get to learn what to do when a crisis happen and all. 

NS teaches you how to be a man, not complaint of the free time or time wasted serving in the army. There's so much you guys can do now with a ""computer room"" to study or what not. You can even bring iPhones in!

&#x200B;

NS defend who? Defend what? Defend the right of aunties to take photo of me in #4 sitting in an empty bus? Defend the right of Singaporean girls to say her father's day is harder, and ballet is harder, so my entire NS sacrifice is discounted down to 0? Defend elites, FTs and their assets? I don't even have the motivation to move a muscle for these people, much less take up a rifle, chiong swa and lay my life for them.

I am one of the rare few who see the need for NS, don't feel it wasted my time at all.

"
e7kip4v,jryj,"Not going into a debate here. Just offering another perspective. If that 2 years of NS is not a matter of life and death for you, then try to be positive so that you gain something from it. And there are many if you would just open your mind. However, if you think it is a waste of time. It WILL be a waste of time. Its all depends on you.
"
e7kc8ya,jryj,I dont think NS is a waste of time. Many people also feel getting an education is a waste of time. 
e7lrvvm,jeepbier,ns is not a compulsory education programme preparing you for work and you shouldn't expect it to be so. it is for national defence. obvious and simple. 
e7mzeg1,0neTwoTree,"That guy is like the 0.0001%. Just because he was able to do it doesn't mean that people are able to do so. Yes, you can learn things from NS and succeed.

FYI if you thinking about oz, by the time you hit 40, 0 chance they'll want you, even if you're a brain surgeon. You pretty much have to be a below-30 brain surgeon with A1 English skills to migrate to oz these days."
e7km5ez,XanPerkyCheck,"See this is the very mentality that makes NS more fucked up than it should be. Whenever someone raises an issue, they face retorts like ""ASA still complain"", ""Pes B/C/E still complain"", ""Infantry much harder, you here still complain"", or the best and most idiotic one, ""if this is too much how to fight *the war*"".

This is why I don't put down any batch serving even though I served almost 20 years ago in combat unit. This is also why I don't criticise any branch. All you're doing is discounting your own service, and giving Singaporean girls a licence to use ""my father time more siong"" to completely discount your service."
e7kgbqx,DiligentService,I agree with you. Meeting all those people made life a lot better. NS is a great time to pick up something new. Start a hobby or learn a new language anything at all really. If you grab a few section mates along for it it'll be way more fun. Make use of the 2 years. The hardest part is to start but at the end you won't regret it. 
e7sb96q,BriefPalpitation,"Lol, this ""war"" opinion is obviously form someone who didn't have an officer position. At least those guys realistically know that after one week, the Armed forces will be over extended, holding land they don't need, waiting for help from the Americans. Singapore officers also have to lead from the front, so they really know how futile and pointless their jobs are...agree about the other points though."

e7kc7bb,aSingaporean,Great! It’s definitely better than feeling as though it’s time wasted. At least you felt that you gained something through NS.
e7kmulc,squirrelballon,"Same here. Didn’t enjoy my time in NS particularly, but looking back it was quite an experience. If you only use work/career to measure what is a waste or worthwhile then I guess it can be a waste? But that’s quite a dim outlook on life isn’t it. 

It depends on a persons particular worldview. Everything that happens in life has worked to make me who I am today. Nothing is ever a waste of time. We are human beings not human doings. It’s who we are rather than what we do.

Just my 2cents"
e7mld5d,cedricSG,Can you share some of the silver linings that you see?
e7kkcqx,aSingaporean,"Well I can’t be positive if factually I know that I’ve gained absolutely nothing from it. It’s basically lying to myself and my face. What dictates if I think it’s a waste of time or not is dependent on from what I gained, things that are useful, things that are applicable for my future, things that have benefited me. And yes, I will still think it’s a waste of time since it was a waste of time for me as I didn’t gained or benefitted from it. 

Bottom line is while you felt that NS isn’t a waste of time, I have felt otherwise and it’s a complete waste of time for me. Nothing wrong in having different opinions."
e7kcht1,aSingaporean,"Perspective I guess, two groups that I’ve met. One is the bochup and anti-NS kind at all costs, but probably would be visiting clubs and screwing around if not for NS. The other is just trying to pursue further education or gain work experience, and just feels that NS is just hindering them and stopping their tracks."
e7khw42,Catcifer,You are not coerced by law to further your education once you get past secondary school though.
e7keqch,LookAtItGo123,"You can’t really put it this way. It’s almost like saying in another 100 years you’ll definitely be dead anyway and anything you do now up to that point is going to be a waste of time since it dosent matter at the end.

There is definitely opportunity loss over here. And one that education doesn’t cause you to. Ultimately, it’s what you choose to do with this “waste of time” that truly makes it a real waste of time, or a make the best out of it waste of time."
e7lxu9f,aSingaporean,"Ok, your point is? Did I mention that NS is a compulsory education programme preparing me for work? What some stated were that they gained and benefited from NS and I simply stated my opinion.

but at the same time, Nope, NS did not hinder nor accelerate him in any way at all. He still would have become half paralyzed. He still would have recovered. He still would have gone on to do well, in the same time frame. Because he did all those things concurrently with his NS.

U make the best of your own situation. I took a part time degree during NS and ended up graduating before my most of my peers

I had a friend who was deployed as a driver. Got his drivers license because of it and immediately started work with DHL as a delivery driver after he ORD

We are all forced into the same circumstances, it is up to you to create and grab every opportunity that U have given the circumstances U are dealt with. "
e7lx8ae,aSingaporean,"Well if I’m essentially signing my life away and obligated to die first in times of war, that itself is already pretty depressing to me. NS experience wise, I can find 101 other ways to experience the “military experience” out of my freewill, and I’m pretty sure it’ll still be more realistic and useful than NS. Yes it’s a National Service and defence, but my opinion still remains.

That’s great to hear that everything that happened in your life has worked to make who you are today. I have almost the same outlook as you, just that everything that happened in my life thus far have been fruitful and hasn’t been a waste of time except for NS. "
e7n7w8m,MrSezy,"NS helped me find a kind of motivation to keep fit (carrot and stick approach), which continues to this day, if I never started morning runs in BMT, I would’ve never known I could do that kind of thing. 

Helped me ALOT with people skills, I learned how to deal with people, how to deal with different types of superiors and different types of people under my charge, which I also still use as a benchmark today.

I was an excel doofus before entering NS, luckily for me, it was kind of an area where I could still make small mistakes and not get chided too hard for it, if I never picked it up in those 2 years (only seeing the importance of it when I was thrown into an office), I probably would’ve struggled with it through uni.

I guess these are some of the “lucky” things I got. But I really enjoyed that independence I got when I entered NS, I was my own man, I really felt detached to the need for my parents to keep me alive and I would say the company around me helped tremendously with building my character to be a better person. "
e7kezsr,jryj,"I would say in the short term, to many people it would have been a waste of time. Long term, really depends on the attitude during NS. Actually this is the time where you should try to develop yourself for long term benefits. Physically, Discipline, Social skills etc. In order to be successful in the long run, these are the skills you need. I met many successful people in life. Their NS is not a waste of time. "
e7kflg2,jryj,"Don't quite understand your first para.
If your immediate objective doesn't require education, then it may be a waste of time. (of course we all don't think so) All depends on your immediate objective. "
e7m088m,jeepbier,"no one's saying it isn't a waste of time either but you shouldn't come into NS with the expectation that you'll benefit from it, looking at ur complaints."
e7kc5z0,microtek789,You can get PR overseas but still come back mah.
e7ls6sd,dingobattler,"If you work, you stress out till you want to die and you don't do anything, its your responsibility. Can always quit your job, look for a more relaxed job, have an exit plan, etc.

NS you stress what can you do? No matter what, still cannot leave. My platoon mate try to apply for leave for the birth of his first child, and you know what my whitehorse PC say? ""You give birth or your wife give birth?""

&#x200B;"
e7kzpzk,XanPerkyCheck,"Other working people have recourse, the ability to leave, and other things not available to NSFs. "
e7kfxmr,aSingaporean,"Well I beg to differ. Forcing an individual to participate or do something wouldn’t inculcate anything values in the long-run if the individual is just doing for the sake of doing. Of course everyone in the army would be disciplined if you’re threatened with DB or confinement. It would only work if every individual has the mindset of that. I also beg to differ that any skills you learn in NS can actually help you in the long-run. Not everyone needs NS to become successful in life. In fact, many who are trying to be successful have been turned and shut down because of invaluable opportunities that were lost due to NS. "
e7md9y7,IvanLu,I don't see where he said that he expected to benefit from NS. Sounds like you invented a strawman.
e7mi5v0,aSingaporean,"Ok? And your point is? I refuted someone that said NS has any long-term benefits while at the same time saying that if you are positive about it, you’ll gained something from it. I simply refuted that it’s simply not true, and factually it wouldn’t even make sense and it’s basically lying to myself. 

Why would my personal believes that “anything that doesn’t benefits me = waste of time” coincide with having high expectations of NS? What kind of illogical and lousy strawman argument is that?"
e7ki8ie,jryj,"2 points you are making here.

1. Since you are forced to do it. Why not make it worthwhile?
2. I agree. For certain profession, the golden age is that 2 years. But for many others they are not. "
e7mijc4,aSingaporean,"Next level strawman indeed. I have never had high expectations of NS. I merely stated that anything that doesn’t benefit me is a waste of my time and NS is a waste of time for me. Actually laughable, when one has no more counter-points to raise, always turn to the strawman."
e7mhe1d,jeepbier,and why did he dedicate a large paragraph in the middle to harping on it? obviously he had an issue with it and you can deduce from his tone not benefitting from ns = waste of time. not everything needs to be laid out in black and white sweetheart 
e7kk1y9,aSingaporean,"Exactly you said it. You are forced to do it. Not everyone can accept someone giving you orders and being expected to follow it without any logic or reasonings while being threatened with punishments. 

Everyone is doing the same exact thing, serving National Service. While it may have felt worthwhile and wholesome for you, it may not be the case for others. There’s no right or wrong in having different opinions. Many have felt that it was a waste of time after serving while you felt it wasn’t. 

Answering your second point, my reasoning wasn’t because some profession’s golden age happened during the two years. My point was that many have missed out opportunities to become successful or upgrade themselves. Whether you think NS is useful or not to become successful is up for more debate. Personally, I think it’s completely useless."
e7mddjz,IvanLu,You can use argument 1 for almost anything involuntary imposed on you including slavery.
e7mip4s,IvanLu,"Because he doesn't like ns and explains exactly why? And because you couldn't refute it you resorted to creating a strawman to pretend he was arguing for something else. That he questioned whether it was necessary for defence or that he expected to benefit from it. Try harder, darling."
d1umzsi,siohoonjiakzhua,"Maybe you could describe what happened after you woke up and found he was trying to penetrate you. (But finish reading before you reply:)

It's also good you have taken measures (creating an account for this specific purpose) to mask your identity. You do not want your statements here to be traced back to you or used against you. That said, internet is still internet. It is important that you could feel safe and comfortable when seeking advice on this matter. So IMHO talking to a real lawyer offline might be a better idea. "
d1upatm,runningman_ssi,"Your situation might account for sexual assault or attempted rape, not rape because it's narrowly defined as penetration in a woman's vagina. But it's hard to convict on such cases without evidence. I'm not sure how well the whatsapp screenshots will hold up, but they seem to be the best you have along with your therapy sessions.

ALL of your responses here are not painting you in a good light. At ALL. The defense will chew you out for pretty much every single comment here.

And yes, your parents will need to be involved. This is not something you want to take the advice of some random strangers over the internet."
d1vwlzo,hardcore_ranger,"From a legal standpoint, there will be a lot of questions raised:

1. Why did you only say it's a rape now? Why didn't you report to police directly?
2. Why did you share a room with him alone? If you don't feel comfortable around him, why do you even go to the staycation in the first place?
3. Was there a verbal form of consent before? Did you indirectly consent to sex for the staycation?
4. Why wasn't your parents with you in the staycation? If you feel worried about being rape, why didn't your bring your parents along with you which leads to point 2.
5. Were there any witnesses around? if not, it's really your word against his word.

Rape/ Molest / Sexual Harassment is a serious crime and will bring serious consequences to the guy (reputation/ caning/ jail time) if he is guilty whether he is truly innocent or guilty. That is why, the police have to triple ensure that it is a valid case before they even begin criminal prosecution against the male party. It would be best if your family and the guy family have a private discussion and see what's going on. Just saying you have a mental depression (feeling dirt/worthless) is not a base for action. Any girl could do that to any random guy so obviously your case will be thrown out of court."

d1up0oh,siohoonjiakzhua,"This thread is pretty much going in directions I thought it would. Take my advice - by all means keep browsing the incoming replies but do not feel obliged to reply or defend your position. You may find it hard to do that as I sense a bit of vindictiveness given your intention of ""sending a message."" But you do not owe an explanation to anyone not involved in the case. Least of all at your own expense - should this thing go to trial, people *will* read it in the news, make the connection and dig this post up (if they haven't already, you never know - Internet can be a very small place).

Edit: It seems from your reply above he stopped. I am not sure of the intention of filing a police report. Did you break up after that incident or only just recently? And you are reporting him to ""teach him a lesson"".

"
d1un52t,samglit,"Depends on whether or not he made statements to anyone after the fact admitting it.  Otherwise it's your word against his unless you have some sort of physical evidence.

If he did admit it to someone who is prepared to testify to that effect, or if for example he texted you apologies etc, you'll probably have at least something to go on.  Whether or not you have a case for outrage of modesty largely also depends on if your relationship was sexual already.  If you told him to stop, and he stopped, it'd be a pretty hard case to prosecute.

First step would be to gather your available evidence, then make a police report.  You can make it on your own since you're a legal adult.  If the AG decides not to prosecute you can still bring a private prosecution but that will be at your own expense."

still sounds like a revenge plot. but i have a few question, when was the relationship over? was it a bad breakup? Did he ever try to do it to you again? was he really apologetic about it? 

Not saying that its not a rape attempt but to try to understand the situation better. because you are sending a guy to jail and he might have a future ahead of him, is it worth destroying his whole life over one attempt.

1. You guys were in a sexual relationship
2. You guys were on a staycation @ at hotel/chalet i suppose
3. You guys slept on the same bed
4. He wanna have sex with you without asking and you want to sue him for rape

I would think its just an oversight of him, do you think he really wanna rape you ? If not, just give him a break. If he stopped after you've shown disinterest, then its enough punishment for him.

Its April now, it must have been some incident that made you mad at him that you want to dig this up and get some revenge. If you are really serious, you should have gone to the police the next day. To me, its abit too late now."
d1y4tw8,whymedeargod,"OP, ignore the comments here. Victim shaming is very common in rape cases regardless of what happened. None of us know you or the relationship you have with your ex-boyfriend to conclude whether or not the rape happened but one thing about rape is that it is non-consenxual sex. It doesn't need to be between strangers and it doesn't need to be violent. [Most rapists are people that the victims know](http://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=289). 

Go to AWARE and do what you need to do. You won't find much useful advice here.

[The number of unreported rape cases are much higher than the number of false rape cases](http://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=297).

Uncomfortable questions are asked to the both of you publicly and personally. You win, he gets a criminal record and pretty much ends up with his life ruined. 

If the above seems like something that is worth the closure or peace of mind you're looking for, then do go ahead.

However, I wish you also consider that there are other ways to put your mind at ease - like communication and therapy, which will allow you to look at things differently and without your emotions obscuring the reality. Please try these before you take a step as drastic as alleging rape."

There are a lot of cases that the police will not deal with, because they can't. If you insist on pursuing your case, please speak to AWARE first to figure out what evidence you need to have / whether your evidence is substantial enough.

Unfortunately, there are cases where a woman cries molest in the hope/expectation that the man will quietly settle / give in to their demands. This makes it tougher for legitimate cases to get heard.

Even if it sounds like a gray area thing to a lot of people, it still doesn't excuse your ex from what he did. There was no consent, you were unable to give consent as you were asleep. It's that simple, even if the law here doesn't view that as rape. I'm pretty fucking sure that if I woke up to my boyfriend attempting to penetrate me when it's not something we've ever discussed prior to it happening, I'd fucking call it non-consensual sex too. Just being ""together"" as gf-bf doesn't give him or anyone a free pass to do whatever they want to your body!

I'm really sorry for what you went through, I really hope you can get some justice and support. I don't really know how else to help but I want you to know that at the very least you're not alone and that you are very brave for wanting to speak up about this despite the rampant victim-blaming that's been going on here. I don't know what else to say other than that I really hope things will be alright for you and that you will heal over time.

d1updpu,evilplushie,"Just let the courts settle it. If she wants to file, file. We can't stop it anyway"
d1utbg5,Nerdinator_,"Hm, I get what you mean by ""sending a message"", but I kinda interpreted it differently; maybe she wanted to send a message that victims can take a stand? That they shouldn't live in fear? Maybe I'm being a little too optimistic here, but with good reason. Even if OP's intentions are wrong, I think rapists should get some form of retribution, whether it's in the eyes of the law or karma. I can't say for sure if OP is doing this for good reasons but I do hope her rapist (if it's real) gets his just desserts, because at the end of the day, rape is still wrong no matter what the context is, right?"
d1up0dv,Nerdinator_,"Dude, I'm trying to offer another side to this. And don't make this a personal attack on me, alright? Like you said, this is the internet, so we never know the full picture :)

I don't believe everything I see on the internet, I'm just trying to be more empathetic with OP."
d1upep1,evilplushie,"Too much random rape claims online.

Otoh, if what OP says is true, she can file a report with the police. It's up to them to investigate"
d1ups6i,Nerdinator_,"Which is a real shame. I feel for people who get wrongly prosecuted, but sometimes I just really don't know what the right solution is. Doubting every cry a victim makes may cause more harm to their mental health than good, but prosecuting every guy could put good men in jail"

d1uvahu,Hope83,"Rape IS wrong. There's no question about that. 

Rape victims shouldn't live in fear. Again no question about that.

But will OP truly get closure or feel better if she does send this message? Is OP doing this out of spite due to some relationship issues with her ex-bf? The former may cause her more emotional and mental pain. The latter may ruin the entire future of her ex-bf. 

Consider carefully the context that OP has presented. Look at it from every possible angle. "
d1upisz,evilplushie,I doubt she'll answer in a neutral way. Too close to the issue
d1uveqo,Nerdinator_,"I have though I doubt it will bring closure to OP, ultimately I see this as a great opportunity to get a conversation going on the issue. Whether or not OP does this out of spite, this presents and brings the sensitive subject of rape up. "

cryhu4n,mwolfee,"First, please give a call to the [Samaritans of Singapore at 1800-221-4444](https://sos.org.sg) if you're in crisis. 

Anyhoo, finding someone to talk to is very important. These may not need be your family or friends if you can't rely on them; several help groups offer email support. It would be best if you could go talk to a counselor, or get a referral to see a therapist. Go to the polyclinic and request for a referral if cost is an issue.

While we're not professionals by any means and some people frown upon giving advice just like that, you can always talk to some people on /r/Singapore. /u/v2blast has listed some subreddits that you can also get help at, though they may not be able to provide local context with certain things.

I wish you all the best, OP. Please feel free to drop me a PM. I won't be able to help much, but if you need a listening ear I'm here."
cryhfdx,captainersatz,"First of all, OP, find a counselor. Find help. I know you've heard this before, but talking to people on the internet isn't going to help you get better.

It might, however, help you feel better. Please feel free to PM me. I've been struggling with depression for over seven years now, but I think I'm finally starting to claw my way out of the pit. I can't offer any solutions, but if you want to talk, I'm here."
cryhjma,V2Blast,"I'm new to Singapore so I don't quite know what the best way of finding a good therapist here is, but therapy does help. You can also reach out to the communities at /r/depression, /r/anxiety, and /r/suicidewatch - but this isn't quite a substitute for proper therapy.

EDIT: I'd also like to recommend checking out [LittleKuriboh's ""We're Still Here"" series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTagxffHmpfSRPdJh1LeNEIyXSNkcc_I_), where he talks about his own struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts (LittleKuriboh is the guy who makes Yugioh Abridged). You might find them helpful, as they help give a bit more perspective on the nature of depression. Depression skews the way you think and makes you feel like your options are more limited than they are."
cryqsf7,90DaysNCounting,"Great job on the steps you have taken towards changing your life. Changing your work environment which was the trigger of all of this was probably the best thing you could have done.

The road to recovery is long and not easy, but seriously can be done. If you are willing to try, see a doctor about antidepressants. But it is possible to fix yourself without also.

Cut yourself some slack at work for the next 6 months or 1 year, you need to be prepared that recovering fully can take as much time as that, and until then you may not be performing 100% optimally.

Go out, explore and try to find new things to enjoy. Start small, and take care of yourself. Get enough sleep. Exercise can truly give you a boost in the hours after the workout. Discover new things you can enjoy doing if the old ones don't satisfy you anymore. Make it a point to try new and novel things, as hard as it can be.

Watch a movie every weekend. Pick up a new hobby if you're up to it. Spend time going out to do something new if you can.

Most of all, reach out to people for help and form new relationships or maintain old ones. Ask your friends out. Ask coworkers out if you can. Talking to someone everyday, it will do wonders for you. It's nice that you have a husband who loves you and whom you love. I would start there. That's already a huge advantage you have that you should make use of, many of us don't have someone special yet.

Gradually you will feel the joy of life returning. It comes very slowly but you will notice a real change in months.

Edit: I know you have tried a lot of self help books. This one is truly different from the rest I have seen. You can torrent and try, I really wish I had had this book when I was going through a hard time. It's called emotional first aid by guy winch."
cryk18d,Pbkia,"Every person is valuable and impacts the world in some way. For good or for ill, each of us makes a tiny contribution to the continued betterment or detriment of the species. We each live our lives and try to leave things a little bit better than we found them. Maybe you work to advance knowledge. Maybe you inspire people through art. Maybe you raise children. Maybe you just try to be a positive presence on those around you in whatever small way you can.


Also, every human life is unique. If you consider something as simple as how many sperm are involved in fertilization, for every human being who lives literally millions of other potential people never got the chance to exist. You won the greatest lottery in all of creation just by being born. You have been given the greatest gift of all, the gift of human life.

I am sorry for the verbal and emotional abuse that you have to go through and you do not deserve to go through any of that.

cryibzd,Pure_Moments,"I went through 3 years of hell at work. I think that's what did me in. First they put me, barely a senior executive for 3 months in charge of the whole front office support function for a treasury of a bank. I have less than 1 year experience in that function then. Obviously stressed out and then some higher up politics dragged me in. 

Then it was 24/7 on standby whenever the job needs me. I do everything - system projects, operational risk, audit, fixing computers, moving computers, if the lights spoil it's my problem. Etc. 

Then facing the toughest boss with the foulest mouth. And a bunch of dealers who would curse and swear at you anything goes wrong. Which is frequent because I'm obviously inexperienced for this. I'm expected to learn the entire treasury function and leadership at the same time. 

Then having teammates who are simply not happy that I'm in charge (like I had a choice) and started workplace bullying like ganging up against me or spreading vicious rumors. 

I spent 3 years working like this. I became terrified of people. I clamped up. I ate lunch alone for the whole time. I had numerous breakdowns at work where I'd hide in the toilet and cry. 

I finally found a new job and moved out. I thought I will get better but I realized the feeling never goes away. Knowing that life is just that. "

The stress and workload pulls you down. I can relate to an extent. Working in a kitchen, having to constantly prove you are worth your position and pay. It's tiring when you do prove your worth, when you fail (and you will because all human makes mistakes) you feel like utter shit.

But don't let it get you down. Why are you working so hard. Who in your life loves you? Do you have family or friend who will be sad to see you die? When you off yourself, who will be crying over your body. I believe you have loved ones or friends that will be sad to see you go. And if you are posting here because you have no close friends to talk to, I'm here. I'll be sad to see you go. Here I am fighting to stay alive and if you die, you prove to me that all my efforts to keep myself alive is futile. 

Cry, shout, slam a few things to get the anger and emotions out of your system. For long term, get a hobby that you can maintain. Something you like doing. Do it, get some semblance of meaning in your life and something that helps you destress. 

Work is stressful. Even when I work, I feel the joy of cooking, but the joy I feel is not enough to counteract the stress I have at work sometimes. Fuck it. Leave the stress of work for work time. End work, forget the stress. Bringing the stress with you home from work means you are still at work. Company not paying you to stress about work when you at home leh. 

Life gets better. There will be ups and downs. Now what you feel is the new workplace stress. But now is different. You got experience from your old workplace. Means you pick up things faster. You learn faster. Things will improve. Build better relationships with your new colleagues. Occasionally buy kopi for them. First priority get to know tour jobscope inside out. Then go learn what others jobscope is like. Then see how you can help them with your experience and knowledge. 

Go go GO!!!"

Even though I'm facing a very shitty boss here, I'll always remember the tough times before and looking back makes me feel stronger. Since you've found a new job, it's time to be that strong you all over again. No matter what tough things you encountering, you'll remember that nothing's worse than before, and you'll persevere.

Personally it never really helped even after switching meds (which came with a new round of side-effects), so I stopped (understandably to the doctor's annoyance), so I'm off it now.

 "
cryjwhd,V2Blast,"> Will anti depressants really help? Will I become overly reliant on them?

Anti-depressants can help, though not everyone needs them. If a therapist or psychiatrist recommends that you try anti-depressants, you can work with the psychiatrist to determine the right dosage for you. They're not addictive or anything, to my knowledge, so that shouldn't be an issue."
crzl2nz,Cataplexic,"I definitely hope you give a visit to the psychiatrist a shot, as well as express your concern about antidepressants. What you said about seeing things is quite worrying and seems more serious than depression alone (despite it not happening anymore).

About anti depressants, if you're worried about side effects, just understand that drugs for ANY illness affect different people differently, and drugs aren't put on the market if they hurt more than heal. I've personally had meds where I got every side effect listed by my practitioner, but there are always alternatives that a psychiatrist will be very familiar with!

In my experience, it is also a relief just to have a professional tell you: ""yes, you have anxiety and depression."" It took away a lot of insecurity and shame, which definitely can help.

Psychiatrists also have a ton of reliable resources like therapists whom they trust. It's not all drugs :). I'd always go to a proper medical doctor as the first step, and that's what psychiatrists are.

The choice of what steps to take are yours entirely, and I hope you make it through this period soon. Though I have no idea what it's like in your shoes, you're not alone!"

You're sick. It's okay. Like any other illness, though, it can be treated. It's okay to be angry, it's okay to be sad, and it's okay to be frustrated because it isn't fair that this is happening to you -- but remember that this is not your *fault*.

Do you think the employer can just call the hospital and ask for Mr Smith records and get a copy faxed? This would be outrageous.

It is also downright impossible to provide counselling and mental health care without confidentiality because patients would never feel free to open up."

cryjmta,Pure_Moments,"Some friends have it tougher than me so I don't want to burden them. 

I don't really have much friends that I'll pour my heart to. My primary sch or sec sch friends are non existent because I'm the target of bully then. Poor and worn down uniform + old backs and hand me down textbooks. No one wanted to be my friend then. 

It makes it hard to make friends when all I know since young is that they want to find out another strange factoid about you that can be made into a song and sung to you between classes. Boys can bond over sports class -- girls just plain out ostracize you. "
cryjaou,Pure_Moments,"I kinda feel that way as well. Those that actually did it took some courage and probably really shitty problems. 

The problem is me really. I don't know what I'm afraid of. Why am I still not happy. I have this other person in me yelling at me telling me how melodramatic I am. That I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. "
cryird7,Pure_Moments,"In the eyes of some I'm just finding excuses. Or I'm a joke of a person. Or I don't deserve my job. Or I don't have ownership. 

I've managed to bite and fight through some shitty jobs in the past and now I find myself not able to handle an easier job? 

All these voices echoes in my head when I let myself feel. Like now, the only thing that bounces off my walls are how horrible I am. It's like when I stop repressing my thoughts all I can think about is how unworthy I am. "

cryjvwm,ElphabaPfenix,It's ok. Dun worry about me. Let's focus on you instead. Feeling better?
cryjm68,NHL_mumps,"That's the thing with depression. We know there's something wrong with being sad all the time and it makes us ashamed to share. But you know, it's not your fault. Stupid brain chemistry la, sometimes make you think shitty stuff. Separate your illness from your identity -- you are more than that. If you've been happy, try to remember that feeling. It comes and goes, but at least you would have known how it felt.

It's a constant struggle and it'll never go away completely but it *can* get better and much more manageable. I can give you a contact to a therapist with a private practice, just PM me."
crz0zg7,,"I have done this and I've been in relationships with people who have done this, it's not a solution when the real enemy is the one staring at you from the mirror. Sooner or later it will creep back up upon you so it's really something you have to face head-on. As long as it's something within.

On the other hand, if the stress is because of poor working environment, lack of opportunities and/or family that you just need to cut ties with, then this is a workable solution. I've moved away for precisely these reasons too and that's what I realised. But for the problems within, like I've mentioned, they will surface again eventually. 

I wish you luck and I hope this morning is a better one. "
cryjib0,mwolfee,"I feel like I'm a burden on my job too - some days I feel utterly incompetent, but at the end of the day, it's only a job. If you're feeling far too stressed, no job is worth your life. If you have some savings built up, you might want to consider taking a break from working."
cryjlhz,ElphabaPfenix,"If that's what you want do it. But plan your next step properly. Dun just quit and find yourself jobless and penniless for months. Are you going to be qualified for your new job in a new industry? What can you do to qualify and shine there. 

You have just found a new purpose in your life. Go concentrate on that. "
crz3o76,Rainholly42,"A change of job environment could mean the difference. My mother used to be snappy, grumpy, anxious, and generally an unpleasant person to be around. Her relationship with my brother and I did a 180 degrees when she switched to a job with lower pay and better working hours where she never had to be on call 24/7 and having to deal with angry and vicious people in her day-to-day. She is a lot happier now and her salary in the new job even managed to match her previous one. 

So perhaps you could consider a career change more seriously, even if it means doing a job of lower status and pay. Things like the toxicity of the environment you're in are extremely important costs to take into account. Think more seriously about what you want out of life, and see if what you're doing now gets you that. If not, do something for your happiness and *do something differently*. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. "

crz25o7,,"You're going to need immediate help, I think. Several years ago I met the family counsellor I was seeing and I told her precisely what I was going to do and why and she took me to the NUH A&E, I consented to all of this. There I was warded for close to two weeks and it was something close to heaven, somehow. Because that was the point when I let go and got an entire team of people to sort me out. I was done trying to go at it alone, reading self-help books, working out, trying different diets etc. I wanted to kick that black dog to the curb and those people in the hospital helped me. 

There's stigma, of course, but that's from other people. Don't listen to them, don't ever listen to them. This isn't about weakness or strength of mind. It's about getting your life back. And your life IS worth it. You've made it this far, I know it's tiring, I know how alluring giving up is but you need to hold on longer. Why? For no other reason than that you exist now, you're a good person, you're human and because what is talking to you in your head right now, is not you. It's the illness. Don't listen to that voice, tell it to fuck off. The illness is not you.

cs0830p,,"Well there was a psychologist and a team of psychiatrists who visited daily. The latter would be monitoring your meds, talk to you in general and then there's the psychologist who does it more comprehensively. Which is something I really appreciated since going for say monthly or weekly therapy is exhausting and draining. But in this residential setting, it's daily and you just retire to bed or do something else. This was mostly CBT and a bit of DBT, I wish I could've have learned the latter though but I am doing that myself now, several years later. 

Aside from that the nurses also organised a bunch of other stuff like art therapy, music, cooking (for the more able ones). And well being around people with other afflictions also, strangely, helped a lot. If you watched shows like ""Girl, Interrupted"", it was nothing like that. There were schizophrenics, there were old people with dementia, there were the bipolar ones. Puts everything in perspective. Without the illness, I am at the base a sociable person who is curious about others so I interacted a lot with the other patients. It's different for others of course and this might not be the best thing but I found that no longer isolating myself helped a lot. Plus the hospital was a very, very safe environment. You have your meals all-ready for you, the nurses are kind and pleasant well of course as long as you don't bother them and are aware (I put this here because some patients were more destructive and the sad fact is that some nurses reacted negatively. they are only human of course. There was a male patient that was starting to deteriorate and as he got more violent, he was taken away to IMH. That was rather scary.) 

I was suffering from severe clinical depression, by that point the only person I talked to or even interacted with was the family counsellor. Not saying that being warded was an instant panacea but it did help tremendously, the rest of the months that followed was difficult but I could feel more human again. "

Same anal thermometer that the encik liked to wave around warning us not to use as an oral thermometer. HA FUCKING HA IT WASN'T FUNNY THE FIRST TIME. 

Also, rode in a civilian ambulance a few times. nothing fatal, but there was a very unfortunate, morbidly obese lady who was suffering chest pains and couldn't walk. we had to use a canvas/flexible stretcher to get her down 3 flights of stairs because her flat didn't have a lift that stopped on every floor. That was hellish. i was so fucking scared of dropping her; we couldn't get a proper grip because her body was so soft and there were a couple times when i thought she was going to slide off the canvas.

d2y6o4h,fanofippo,"thanks for thread, saw a few interesting ones in my time.. 

In Australia, attended to a trooper's whose leg got badly damaged in an accident.. was badly bent. 

Saw a regular's hand get badly cut till the last finger was dangling by a skin.. He was bad ass, still talking away and asking for a ciggie.

Attended to many heat exhaustion cases! After they are rolled in... Cut off the uniforms, insert anal thermometer, insert IV, use the shower bath on them.. 

Attended to a NSF who ""committed suicide"" by drinking large amounts of the toilet floor washing liquid.. had to send him to the hospital on my ""evening off"" night and saw him get a tube inserted into his nose to wash the stomach..  

As a civilian, my elderly woman neighbour collapsed at home, so was called by her daughter to save her... I administered CPR till the ambulance came.. Alas was too late to save her :( 
"
d2y9ie7,archer7319,"Was a medic at Central, aside from the usual gory trauma, suicide, collapse cases, drowned bodies, and old people medical emergencies, we also had the hilarious/sad stuff that happened on drunk Fri/Sat nights.

Many drunk/passed out people, but funniest one was at the lobby of an apartment building around Pomo. Entered the lobby, me and crew immediately hit with the stench of human faeces. Look around, see a dismayed looking security guard pointing to his chair and desk in the middle of the lobby. Apparently one of the residents got too drunk while out, came home and decided that he needed to poop really badly. Decided to pull down his pants and sit on the first toilet-looking object he saw. Turned out to be the guard's chair. 

As well all know from experience, beer shits are never solid, and he exploded in a disgustingly accurate halo of diarrhea around the security chair and desk. Worst part was, we has so drunk that he didn't know what was going on and we had to go up to his unit to ask someone to come take care of him.

We go up to unit and find out that he's 18 years old, and together with his mom, little sister, and maid, had an awkward ride down the elevator to show them where their kid was.

Police arrived much much later, gagged at the smell, took down some info and gtfo'd pretty quick. To this day I still don't know how I stood in that lobby with the smell for like 45mins plus. I chalk it down to sleep deprivation.

Beyond that, I've also been involved in a couple of high profile cases around the Central area. Was one of the crew who attended to the victims of the Sarawak slashers, that was a talking point for a while.

BTW if you watch the recent channel 8 drama about paramedics, you might see my cameo as I was assigned to watch over the equipment while mediacorp was filming and was roped in as an extra.

d2y9kwb,danieell,"> regulars: people who call so often you end up remembering their names/conditions/and even IC numbers. in particular, sent one guy really often, wrote a piece on my experiences with him for college apps. pronounced him dead when he was hit by a car in a hit and run. had to drive past the ""fatal accident"" sign for weeks on the way home afterwards. his dad still calls once in a while :(. once we spent 3 hours at scene because we refused to convey him (wasn't injured), took 3 SPF patrol cars, i.e. 6 officers, to get him to desist.

d2zib85,jaemian,"Not SCDF but was an Air Force driver. Was first attached as a runway driver/inspector and subsequently ambulance driver. 

First week of attachment, F5 front wheels was unable to fully lock. Had to watch and pray in real time, looking at the plane try to land, it's wheels disintegrating with a ton of sparks, walkie talkies going silent and fire engines chasing after the plane in case it catches fire.

Subsequently got attached to medical center which also acted as medical centre for East side for night cases. Seeing my fair shares of people wanting to chao keng, their face changing and protesting when doctors resort to putting them on drips for an entire day to discourage such tactics. 

A regular kicking up a huge ruckus when he found out he was HIV positive. 

Old aunties and uncles working around the airbase as cleaners and odd jobs refusing medical aid despite vomiting blood, signs of heat strokes etc fearing they have to pay :(

Looking at a technician who collapsed and on the verge of death, body limping on a fighter jet while he was doing a routine inspection, looking helplessly while people were trying help as there was just no safe way to get him down quickly to administer medical aid. He eventually passed away. 

My first test came when a regular from a squadron deep inside the base suffered a heart attack. Brain behaving in an extreme heightened mode trying to rush him to hospital, using prior experience to pre-emptively communicate with control tower using runway hoping to shave off precious seconds, relentlessly using the sirens and wails on the ambulance to make drivers get out of the way, ignoring SAF ""safety"" driving regulations to make it to the hospital. Managed to made it. Doctors told me if we were a few minutes later, he wouldn't have made it. 

People like to make fun of drivers or even NSFs in general, saying how slack they are, how stupid they can be and all. I'd like to think that when you delegate heavy responsibilities to adolescents and young adults, making people who are only 18 or so drive Class 4 vehicles and crucial vehicle platforms like ambulances when such jobs tend to be done by people who are much older in the private sectors, making them involved in matters considering life and death, there need to be more understanding and appreciation for such thankless jobs. Most of us who seen and experienced these unfortunate incidents are able to move on with life and become a stonger/better person, but I've seen colleagues who became scarred, like a piece of them has disappeared, some who has recurring nightmares and require psychiatric help. 

Ultimately though, after coming back from a long Europe trip, I believe that NS helped to toughen up the perspectives of an average Singaporean male, despite how apathetic we might seem in daily life.

d2y4h89,hatuah,"I was an SAF medic, so the shit that I've seen is definitely not as bad as those encountered by our SCDF counterparts.

Was the cover medic for an SOC exercise and my friend happened to be running. Friend was climbing the low wall and suddenly fell backwards. The fall didn't look bad so I asked if he was ok and if he could stand up. He tried standing up but the minute he stood up, one of his knees buckled and I heard a cracking sound. 

Rushed to get the stretcher and brought him to the medical centre for the MO to examine. He was subsequently sent to the A&E department and we found out that he tore his ACL through a freak accident. His rifle wasn't buckled tight enough, so while he was trying to climb the low wall, his rifle swung and the rifle butt smashed his knee directly. He ended up being on MC for 6 months. 

I still feel bad for him till this day, his injury might not have been so serious if I had stretchered him immediately."

Had a number of weird stuff going on. 1 recruit tried to swim out of Tekong in the wee hours and got caught by coast guards patrol then got sent back to us. We, the medics on duty, had to assist because of reasons.

Had 1 recruit who was possessed by spirits. His friends were sprinkling holy water over him while we tried to resuscitate him and keep him under control. 

Had 1 recruit came to me during field camp in the middle of the night because he can't pee. Then had to bring him back for for catheterisation. 

Had a recruit with heat injury from road march. 16km. Insert rectal thermometer then put him under BCU with tornado fan blowing. He shat himself. Juniors had to clean the shit.

1. Guy dislocated his arm serving a tennis ball. 

2. Many people stuck between toilet seats

3. Man refused to call out to relatives outside the toilet because he didn't want them to see his balls

4. Guy has a distended stomach, the moment we turn him sideways he crop dusts my paramedic in a fart cloud. 

5. Guy with big balls demanding we look at his big balls because it hurts

6. Guy calls because he is having a tooth ache.

7. Guy gets hit by a car, asks if his tattoo is ok (Ultimate Ahbeng)


Worst cases

1. Middle of night shift C-case

2. RTA where the person had her leg shaved down to the bone, she was wailing in pain then got really quiet. 

3. C-case where wife dies in front of husband and us, we were scrambling around his small house and he was destroying it telling us over and over again ""Step anywhere is ok, just save her life"" He at first didn't know she was dead and kept calling to her. Really fucked with my concentration. Never liked to hear a grown man cry, she died. From smoking at the window, to a breathless call text to death in a matter of minutes. Death can hit anytime and without warning, even after a trip for 2 at Krabi. (The only time I truly wanted to bring someone back to life)

4. Old man attempted suicide but was talked down by friends, spent an hour talking him away from killing himself, the police told us he either went with the ambulance to a hospital or get detained at the detention centre (He wanted to die because his wife died a year ago and his children didn't want to see him). He finally got around to coming with us on the stretcher. Just as he sat down the police told us they were taking over. It just broke me to think that after all I told him about how we were going to take care of him and give him a warm hospital bed, the police will be locking him away like a criminal for god knows how many hours all because he couldn't stand living anymore. (I don't blame SPF, they have their protocol we have ours)

5. One of my first few shifts, this one fucked with my mind to this day and I honestly do my best to make sure I am prepared for every case now because of it. A normal call becomes a C-case, I run down the stairs to get the LUCAS but take time to find it (First few shifts), get lost on my way up in my panic as to what the case is. By the time I get up my Paramedic pronounces the  guy died and it's a DOA. I figured she just did it to cover our asses because of how long I took. I spent the next 30 minutes listening to the whole family cry. Really felt like shit for a long time. It was my fault.

Touching cases

1. Small boy and mother on a bicycle hit by a car, boy through his tears demands we look after his mother and makes sure she was ok. He was 6ish.

2. Maternity (Yay) You enter the hospital and unlike a C-case the doctors have smiles on their faces. The blood scrubs out eventually but the feeling of bringing life into this world is the best.

"
d2zjn2e,thechineseninja,"I was a medic who was doing mostly administrative work - massive backlog, with every ah beng and ah seng wanting to downgrade. I've seen some weird shit during medical boards and I've had soldiers coming in and telling my doctor stupid reasons just to get out of training during consultation hours (""I feel sleepy when I put on my helmet"" anyone?)

Anyway, so one day we had a high flyer presiding over the medical board for the month in my medical centre and we're just wrapping up and I was looking forward slacking off in front of the TV when the COS of a unit rushes in and tells my MO in front of the high flyer, 
COS: ""sir sir, we got a suicidal soldier."" 

MO asks, is he in a safe position? (i.e. not on top of building) 

COS: yes. 

MO: okay bring him to me, I'll talk to him.

COS: ok. (runs off, and then back pedals.)

COS: Sir, i don't think we can pry him out from the General Store, he's just banging his head on the wall and he's got his hands gripped on two shelves in between him.

MO (to me): Get the MO bag, we go to him.

High flyer: I would like to stay and watch.

MO (in his most garang tone): Sir no problem, please do, sir.

I go to the cupboard, and realises I don't know where the key is. So I broke down the door. like literally, took screwdriver snap the door open. Grabs the bag, ran out.
Coming out, I got to the door, and we headed out and saw 3 of the biggest sergeants in the unit carrying this skinny ass dude (who has a record of malingering) in.

We brought him into the treatment room, and the 3 specs are sitting on him because he's trying to escape. My doctor told me to lock the doors of the treatment room, and then we release him. He starts running around screaming that he wants to die, he will blow up the whole camp while my doctor calmly fills up a syringe of valium. He turns around, seeing the soldier running around. By now he's exasperated, (and the high flyer, obviously having a whale of a time watching this comical mess) and the soldier runs towards him. My MO clothes line him; turns him around and jabs him in the ass with the valium.

We left him on the floor for awhile to monitor his vital signs before I sent him to IMH in the SAF ambulance. Had the 3 specs in the ambulance with me just in case he turns violent but he just kept muttering he wants to blow us all up and we can re-incarnate with him. 

Turns out, trying to pull a fast one hoping that the doctors will diagnose him mentally unstable so that he doesn't have to go to Tekong for BMT recourse. 

Ended up in Kranji detention barracks instead."
d2zr79r,LingNemesis,"Slightly different angle here - from the hospital/medical context. 

Former radiographer (someone who take medical images for diagnosis), used to work at a local general hospital. 

So, at several occasions, I had to x-ray:

* Severed arm at mid-humerus (mid-upper arm) in a clear plastic bag with ice cubes at 4am in Emergency. Woke me up completely. Had to x-ray the arm to let the doctor decide if it's prudent to re-attach the limb. I also had to x-ray the poor dude's stump of an arm later on.
* Foreign worker's thigh which got punctured by a thick metallic industrial rod (the 1.2m-ish rod was still there when the patient was pushed in). I could see the bedding from the other side of the thigh through the gaping thigh-hole. It was surreal. Most delicate handling required. 
* Numerous cases of gangrenous pus-producing diabetic cellulitis swollen foots. Most of them came wrapped up in NTUC plastic bags. You can see the pus-liquid dancing inside the plastic bag sometimes. That smell is something to remember - especially I had to squat down to ask the patient to step on the x-ray imaging plate and touch/position the foot properly. 
* Numerous cases of foreign workers' amputated fingers from industrial accidents. Poor things, foreign workers. 
* A couple of instances seeing patients drawing their last breathes in front of me, just when I was about to x-ray them. Usually at emergency resuscitation room. 
* Orthopedic surgeries in the operating theaters - all those hammering, pulling, fixing, straightening and screwing of bony parts, plus the collateral gore. It's awesome to watch surgeons do their work to fix up the human body. Exhilarating to see the difference before and the after the surgeries.  

That's all I remember for now. I left the industry some years ago. "
d2yx0zp,Riou_Atreides,"This thread made me miss my NSF time when my RotA friends told stories about undesirable incidents the day/night before. I did not miss the accidents but the storytelling where first it sounded like a thriller but soon after became a horror. Like how some of my senior had to videograph people who were suiciding and when they jumped, their head splattered and their brain painted all over the pavement or head swollen up because of truss collapsing on them. They way they told the story was so vivid and you could imagine them. Pictures and videos were taken by them but I never had the balls to look at it. Even after they archive it on their PC, I still hesitate to ask for a quick look. Good job to all of you who has the stomach for these, especially to the NSFs who did not want the job and had to be mentally prepared in the first place. "

We moved back to station, I was in front.  I think was walking too fast or one of the stretcher carrier had slippery hands.  In front of the crowd, the stretcher slipped off her hand and dropped the casualty on the running track.  Instructor and seniors came to help.  Casualty suffered cracked ribs.

I had a funny feeling when I heard the slamming sound.  Went to the general office. One student tried to stop the door from slamming.  Punched his hand into the glass.  Slit his forearm just after wrist to near elbow.

There was blood everywhere.  On the floor and a small pool in a chair. A teacher was try stop the bleeding by holding the cut close.  Against all training, I applied a tourniquet with a bandage.  Used another to close the wound and raise the arm like Statue of Liberty. The blood slowed to a trickle.

I was terrified of tying it too tightly and causing him to loose his arm.  So I had to loosen it periodically, at the cost of more dripping blood.

Actually I don't have to loosen his tourniquet if the ambulance arrived sooner.  When someone calls 995 at a school, the police turned up first.  The officer took one step and noped out immediately.

Ambulance came and took him.

I have to help the cleaner to mop up the blood, because she already puke twice doing the classroom.
After the holidays, he showed me his scar.  We shook hands that was it.

I spent the next 30 minutes listening to the whole family cry. Really felt like shit for a long time. It was my fault.

Highly unlikely it's your fault. The protocol to pronounce DOA is quite straightforward, meaning the body was showing signs such as rigor, lividity etc, meaning DEAD for a long time already, meaning totally unsaveable. also, without lucas can't do CPR meh?

At the resuscitation room, we basically just made sure he didn't bit his tongue and gave him Diazepam. After that sent to IMH. We can't do much except listen to his friends who were apparently experts in the field of the supernatural.

They made sure that the quran was tied to him, starting chanting and praying then sprinkle water which was supposedly holy and blessed.

Not sure what happened to him after IMH. "

Had a no duff heat stroke case while being deployed out on BCS. We were sitting around having cup noodles when we had a call for no duff. Vehicle came in, and we all tossed our noodles out when my MO opened the door and his unconscious body fell on him.

We went through something like 6 bags of IV, one malay medic saying last rites for him, one medic doing CPR, and thankfully we had a A&E specialist and a staff nurse with us on the team. Both men was the calmest in the tent. Everyone was running around like mad men. Couldn't find the rectal thermometer, couldn't find the thermometer sheath when we decided to use the normal thermometer on his ass. Didn't have enough ice and water to cool him down (he was pushing 42-43 degrees) so we busted out our personal stash of ice boxes filled with ice cream and coca cola, 100plus cans to cool his body down.

Battalion S3 came down, CO came down, every one of the senior combat officers were shitting bricks in their pants at the entrance of the BCS, repeating ""please evacuate now"".

Stabilized him, MO and staff nurse sent him to hospital, came back with KFC for the entire team. shiok. MO and Staff nurse medic also said that the hospital nurses gave them a WTF look when they saw ice cold cans of drinks at the dude's groin and armpits, magnum ice creams at his neck.

P/S:
When u use the rectal thermometer on someone who is fully passed out, he won't feel anything. Its the surest way to check if the fella is trying to pull a fast one on you. 

PP/S: 
To the SAF combat medics, we usually don't respond to real cases, especially on exercises. But when others deploy for exercises; we deploy for real. Never forget that. Your reservist mates rely on you to save their lives if anything happens to them. Pack your stuff, know where you keep your shit. You don't want to be on the receiving end of a commission asking you why didn't you do better to save his life.

I would troll the rest of the medic trainees by removing the needle before untying the tourniquet.

On a separate note- I've seen a special forces operator IV himself. Amazing shit. I've got all the respect in the world for those men. 

It used to be 16G needles because the theory is, combat injuries will require you to deliver fluids as fast as possible. These days I think they use 18-20Gs

They don't really focus on it for SCDF medics because 1) by right, the regular paramedic is supposed to be doing all the cannulating 2) by left, they let you try anyway, and you get a lot of really good opportunities and situations to practice. Back of a speeding vehicle, old people/addicts with thin/collapsed veins, etc..

I really respect the paramedics that can set a line on the first try on a spidery-veined auntie while the crazy driver in front is going 110km/h over bumpy roads and cornering like Initial D. That's mad skillz right there.

We stock 16-20G too IIRC. Usually use 18s - we tend to save the higher gauges for critical cases, annoying patients, drunkards and kengsters. Used to know a guy who kept a stockpile of 12Gs he nicked from the hospitals in between delivering patients for that exact purpose"

When there's a serious need for prompt cannulation, medics should be trained for the worst-case scenario.

Even if someone asks about it, you can acknowledge it, point out that it was years ago and redirect their attention to your university track record. It is important to appear that you have your shit together even if you are self-conscious about it.

IMH is not prison, you have a record but it is inaccessible to everyone (Barring a few circumstances - for e.g. court-mandated order). You make an IMH record sounds like a criminal record.

I have an IMH ""record"". When I was in primary school, I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia. After years of therapy, medicine and coupled with coping lessons done by team of counsellors - I can proudly say that I am high functioning. Discharged about 13 years ago.

I am a teacher now, no one is any wiser. When I get stress, the symptoms do show up once in a while, that is when I have to kick my ""coping lessons"" into overdrive. 

I was never violent anyway. More of a person whose mind is not located in the body. 

So relax. It is important not to stress about the stigma. Just focus on the therapy. 

So far, the civil service in Singapore has one of the best support for mentally ill individuals. I have quite a few colleagues who have mental illness. It is always accepted as an illness. You are sick, you work on it and get better. Then come back when you are better. No one really bothers as long as you don't ""keng"" and ""eat snake"" lol.

As for your work eligibility, it's not exactly about the PES status, it's that the PES status usually draws the curiosity of your potential employers who would then want to know more about your condition.

d08tdgx,tayhhd,"Hey, my advice for you would be to get good grades in uni, apply for a mid term scholarship and use this story as a selling pt about how you overcame adversity :)"
d0a839d,akselmonrose,"Hang in there. Most MNCs don't give a hoot about Singapore PES status. In fact, go for management associate programmes since you are pretty good on the studies front. None of the interviews I've been to have ever asked me about it."
d0adoym,Nig666,"Although private/mnc can't access ur NS record, they can ask for ur NS certificate which states your NS vocation. i assume ur a clerk and clerk is only for non-combat fit people which is PES C and below, so even though the certificate doesn't show ur PES status or medical history, it will state ur vocation.

u have to declare your medical condition/history in the job application form. If not the employer will ask you how come you served as a clerk in NS and ask about your pes status, you can't lie that you have no illness as you're a PES E Clerk. also, the job application form (in most cases) will ask you about your ns rank and vocation. my current company asked for NS rank and vocation in the application form, can't remember about the NS PES though.

as for government sector, everything in government is surely linked and when u want to apply for govt job, u will be scrutinized from head to toe. but u can try.. so to answer ur question, there's no definite answer, maybe some companies will judge u for ur medical history or condition (we live in a judgmental society) and will probably assume u chao keng even if u think u didn't thus lowering ur chance of being hired. 

Whatever happened has happened, u have a IMH record and there's nothing u can do about it, it will stick to u for life. the only thing u can do it move on and continue building yourself up and do what you do best in life.

I posted this on All Singapore Stuff too as ur post is featured there."
d0aucx5,wi5hbone,"In Singapore it is ridiculously tough, especially with the lack of social-openness or even a ""want"" to be aware of mental challenges that individuals face.

I do not have Bipolar, but I have done reading on these various conditions and have even taught (guitar) kids with adhd.

So the thing is that, talking about it and sorting through discussions online is always helpful - many ideas to gain from.

However ultimately, to a degree you have to realise that You are NOT your condition. You are another human being just like all of us here commenting.

As difficult as this may be (and certainly most challenging) that people who do not have what you have cannot even begin to fathom the troubles you go through,

in your mind, if you can *choose* to put aside all of this, and simply put that 1 goal of working in gov in your mind - together with taking the time to work out a strategy with doctors or family on your route to get there, together with alternative plans and an added contingency route (in the event of having to forego for another option).. I say


Why not?"
d08mc86,dashrandom,Are you taking your meds and your psychiatrist know if they aren't working? Bipolar disorder is one of the harder conditions to treat due to conflicting symptoms. Please take your lithium if you're always depressed. 
d08mr1u,swifterrr,"Bro, if you're brilliant you don't have to work in the government."
d08rtwa,Nidsan,"May I ask what branch are you working in and what is your vocation? Your education qualification and other factors used for employment into the civil service?

Not taking any drugs at the moment. I've been mostly stable, some ups and downs but nothing I cannot handle . Taking supplements known to help depression or mental acuity e.g phosphatidylserine 
Helps greatly"
d0qnpac,dtwn,Lithium is great for treating Bipolar but do be careful about the effects of it on your kidney. 
d08qyui,Nidsan,"Thank you, that does make a lot of sense. I may not wish to work for someone who is prejudiced about mental health issues. Hopefully university works out, I'm not the study type and I heard it's a different ball game over there "
d08plyb,Nidsan,"Thank you, that's reassuring. "
d08lxrq,oneslowdance,4 weeks for me this year rofl. Two cycles. Fucking waste of time.
d08mh34,Nidsan,That's true but I was told I would be discharged from any kind of reservist or other NS liabilities as soon as I ORD. The only difference would be the perceived benefits of finishing my service vs not finishing service 
d08lpkt,mrkiasume,Exempted from NS and reservist
d08mf0q,Nidsan,"I was told I would be considered a second class citizen. Will have problems applying to hdb or other government things. Told by the psychiatrist in imh that I cannot work in the government, a teacher, a nurse, any kind of social work."
d09vsjn,Nidsan,Yeah do tell us how it works out!
d08p3qg,Nidsan,"Thank you for your input. No I did not get my degree before NS, my mistake, I mean I got admitted. I was supposed to study in NTU on my final year of poly and continue to do so after graduation, as part of a special arrangement before enlistment to NS. Though I did not do that but instead did my last year as per normal and then did some entrepreneurship before enlistment.
On the PES, that's what I was worried about yes, employers would want to know what caused me to have that PES and I took a look at scholarships as well and they also look at your NS records. I fear greatly that all these will be jeopardise my future. Application to the company that I wish to work in the future, Exxon also seems to show that they care about your rank, vocations, and PES. Correct me if I'm wrong or this does not affect?
At my work place, I was considered the go-to person to get anything solved, from PowerPoint to excel, even regular officers would task their projects to me. Generally I'm hard working and was reliable enough for batallion best soldier until I snapped and got warded into IMH which in my opinion wasn't due to my instability but on the treatment I was given, a dumping spot for work without being given offs and expected to work overtime till midnights numerous times, working on weekends and while on MC. Surely if I was the only person that could solve this(My skills were good enough to freelance online and code vba), they ought to have rewarded me at least . I did not chose this and it's depressing to see people getting away with doing less and getting the same remunerations as me"
d08rpj4,Nidsan,"That's assuring, but does the government differentiate on candidates which have mental mood disorders versus the physically disabled? What about salary difference between the healthy and the disabled?"
d08rjk1,Nidsan,The benefits of working for government or large MNCs are good as compared to small private companies and I was hoping to have a good career in the future. Or at least the potential to. 
d0aic8k,Nidsan,"I don't see your reply over there.
Though I didn't knew it was posted there at all, sans permission.
Now I'm feeling a bit terrified - it's more public now and people might know who I am.
On your comments - What you say here doesn't tally to the previous replies which were leaning to ""NS doesn't matter"" & ""No Reservist is better"" opinions, well a new input to account."
d08v6bt,Vexdetta,"I rather not disclose that, sorry mate. In NS though, I was a Signals storeman. Didn't even complete a year of NS. Was kicked out with a PES F status even after I begged repeatedly for PES E. 

I'm a diploma holder with years of experience in an unrelated field, currently pursuing a part time degree. 

Honestly though, I don't think they really care. I went for a medical checkup before the interview. The doctor didn't even bother asking why I didn't complete NS / why I'm PES F."
d0qo4i0,Vexdetta,"I think the word is 'manage', rather than 'treat'.  (:

And yup, if you're on lithium, your doctor will make you go through blood tests once in awhile to make sure the toxicity levels are well below the unsafe range. "
d08zgwx,yourleftleg,Same here...  4+ weeks this year
d08o61o,homar1dz,I'll bet the psychiatrist is just psychoing you. You can get a job in the government sector despite your PES.
d08ok00,shawshanks,"Bro don't worry. We are all, already second class citizens in our own country. :)"
d08s43g,DingyWarehouse," Pes F or not, youre still a second class citizen."
d08sgpb,doc-tom,"Sorry, I don't have the answers to your questions. All I know is that there are Singaporeans who have not served NS but still work in the civil service. "
d0bbzud,Nig666,"The article there featuring your post seems to be removed so no worries about it.


NS matter or doesn't matter etc.. it's hard to say. Some companies don't really care about what you did in NS (but you still have to fill in your NS information in the job application form), some companies will ask for your Certificate of Service and look at it as an experience or as a way to assess your character (this is true for government sector, virtually all government sectors will ask for your COS hence the scrutiny from head to toe I mentioned earlier), some companies won't even ask for it and they're less likely to ask for it as you're older and have other work experiences to add to your resume. 


I have a cousin who didn't serve NS, he got PES F due to some blood clot related issue. He even requested for PES E during CMPB checkup but apparently the MO thinks his condition is so debilitating that even a clerical role in NS isn't suitable for him. I don't believe he is a second class citizen as he is still fully capable of working and his condition does not impede his ability to do the job he wants. It's not like he was exempted from NS due to a mental illness, if that's the case then we can probably establish the fact that he WILL have difficulties in looking for jobs. 

In short: Just do your best in NS and your studies, your COS grading will affect your employment prospect in the government sector. As for your illness, I don't know, there's no definite answer. Maybe some companies are more careful about people who are permanent PES E/F due to a mental illness, some won't as long as you prove yourself to be capable, so you should have something to back you up in case they do talk or question about your illness. (E.g, school grades, portfolio, work experience, testimonial etc..)

Nothing is impossible, you might face some difficulties or disadvantages who knows, but that doesn't mean you can't get a job in whatever company you want to work at."
d0rqopl,dtwn,"Fair enough. 

Just a heads-up, even with the lithium blood tests being in the safe zone, your kidney can suffer over long-term use. "
d08qusa,Nidsan,"Almost sounds like a pun, haha. But it was already late into my NS when I was warded, left a few months so I'll just keep going. I had the offer to PES F earlier on in my first year but I didn't take it."
d0bmkvm,Nidsan,"I requested the article to be removed. The Facebook post that was shared on their page was truncated and did not show the full background. Some of the comments were upsetting, hinting that I can't even enter university or any form of work.
There are a few bipolars here that apparently have gained employment in government sectors. Private companies apparently don't care so much and as the top comment says, having no reservist might be better.
I may have to compensate for my condition as you said, prejudice might still be present. I'll have to do well for my stint in Ntu, hopefully get 2nd upper or first just to be seen as capable enough . Sigh"
